THE OPENING\\n(al-Fatihah)\\n1. In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Mer\\ufffeciful.\\n2. Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds.\\n3. The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\\n4. Master of the Day of Judgment.\\n5. It is You we worship, and upon You we call \\nfor help.\\n6. Guide us to the straight path.\\n7. The path of those You have blessed, not of \\nthose against whom there is anger, nor of \\nthose who are misguided.\\n2. THE HEIFER\\n(al-Baqarah)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Alif, Lam, Meem.\\n2. This is the Book in which there is no doubt, \\na guide for the righteous.\\n3. Those who believe in the unseen, and per\\ufffeform the prayers, and give from what We \\nhave provided for them.\\n4. And those who believe in what was revealed \\nto you, and in what was revealed before you, \\nand are certain of the Hereafter.\\n5. These are upon guidance from their Lord. \\nThese are the successful.\\n6. As for those who disbelieve—it is the same \\nfor them, whether you have warned them, or \\nhave not warned them—they do not believe.\\n7. Allah has set a seal on their hearts and on \\ntheir hearing, and over their vision is a veil. \\nThey will have a severe torment.\\n8. Among the people are those who say, “We \\nbelieve in Allah and in the Last Day,” but they \\nare not believers.\\n9. They seek to deceive Allah and those who \\nbelieve, but they deceive none but them\\ufffeselves, though they are not aware.\\n10. In their hearts is sickness, and Allah has in\\ufffecreased their sickness. They will have a pain\\ufffeful punishment because of their denial.\\n11. And when it is said to them, “Do not make \\ntrouble on earth,” they say, “We are only re\\ufffeformers.”\\n12. In fact, they are the troublemakers, but they \\nare not aware.\\n13. And when it is said to them, “Believe as the \\npeople have believed,” they say, “Shall we be\\ufffelieve as the fools have believed?” In fact, it is \\nthey who are the fools, but they do not know.\\n14. And when they come across those who be\\ufffelieve, they say, “We believe”; but when they \\nare alone with their devils, they say, “We are \\nwith you; we were only ridiculing.”\\n15. It is Allah who ridicules them, and leaves \\nthem bewildered in their transgression.\\n16. Those are they who have bartered error for \\nguidance; but their trade does not profit \\nthem, and they are not guided.\\n17. Their likeness is that of a person who kin\\ufffedled a fire; when it illuminated all around \\nhim, Allah took away their light, and left \\nthem in darkness, unable to see. \\n18. Deaf, dumb, blind. They will not return.\\n19. Or like a cloudburst from the sky, in which \\nis darkness, and thunder, and lightning. They \\npress their fingers into their ears from the \\nthunderbolts, in fear of death. But Allah sur\\uffferounds the disbelievers.\\n20. The lightning almost snatches their sight \\naway. Whenever it illuminates for them, they \\nwalk in it; but when it grows dark over them, \\nthey stand still. Had Allah willed, He could \\nhave taken away their hearing and their sight. \\nAllah is capable of everything.\\n21. O people! Worship your Lord who created \\nyou and those before you, that you may attain \\npiety.\\n1\\n2. THE HEIFER (al-Baqarah)\\n22. He who made the earth a habitat for you, \\nand the sky a structure, and sends water \\ndown from the sky, and brings out fruits \\nthereby, as a sustenance for you. Therefore, \\ndo not assign rivals to Allah while you know.\\n23. And if you are in doubt about what We \\nhave revealed to Our servant, then produce a \\nchapter like these, and call your witnesses \\napart from Allah, if you are truthful.\\n24. But if you do not—and you will not—then \\nbeware the Fire whose fuel is people and \\nstones, prepared for the disbelievers.\\n25. And give good news to those who believe \\nand do righteous deeds; that they will have \\ngardens beneath which rivers flow. When\\ufffeever they are provided with fruit therefrom as \\nsustenance, they will say, “This is what we \\nwere provided with before,” and they will be \\ngiven the like of it. And they will have pure \\nspouses therein, and they will abide therein \\nforever.\\n26. Allah does not shy away from making an \\nexample of a gnat, or something above it. As \\nfor those who believe, they know that it is the \\nTruth from their Lord. But as for those who \\ndisbelieve, they say, “What did Allah intend \\nby this example?” He leads astray many \\nthereby, and He guides many thereby; but He \\nmisleads thereby only the evildoers.\\n27. Those who violate Allah’s covenant after its \\nconfirmation, and sever what Allah has com\\ufffemanded to be joined, and commit evil on \\nearth. These are the losers. \\n28. How can you deny Allah, when you were \\ndead and He gave you life, then He will put \\nyou to death, then He will bring you to life, \\nthen to Him you will be returned? \\n29. It is He who created for you everything on \\nearth, then turned to the heaven, and made \\nthem seven heavens. And He is aware of all \\nthings.\\n30. When your Lord said to the angels, “I am \\nplacing a successor on earth.” They said, \\n“Will You place in it someone who will cause \\ncorruption in it and shed blood, while we de\\ufffeclare Your praises and sanctify You?” He \\nsaid, “I know what you do not know.”\\n31. And He taught Adam the names, all of \\nthem; then he presented them to the angels, \\nand said, “Tell Me the names of these, if you \\nare sincere.”\\n32. They said, “Glory be to You! We have no \\nknowledge except what You have taught us. \\nIt is you who are the Knowledgeable, the \\nWise.”\\n33. He said, “O Adam, tell them their names.” \\nAnd when he told them their names, He said, \\n“Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of \\nthe heavens and the earth, and that I know \\nwhat you reveal and what you conceal?”\\n34. And We said to the angels, “Bow down to \\nAdam.” They bowed down, except for Satan. \\nHe refused, was arrogant, and was one of the \\ndisbelievers.\\n35. We said, “O Adam, inhabit the Garden, \\nyou and your spouse, and eat from it freely as \\nyou please, but do not approach this tree, lest\\nyou become wrongdoers.”\\n36. But Satan caused them to slip from it, and \\ncaused them to depart the state they were in. \\nWe said, “Go down, some of you enemies of \\none another. And you will have residence on \\nearth, and enjoyment for a while.”\\n37. Then Adam received words from his Lord, \\nso He relented towards him. He is the Relent\\ufffeing, the Merciful. \\n38. We said, “Go down from it, all of you. Yet \\nwhenever guidance comes to you from Me, \\nthen whoever follows My guidance—they \\nhave nothing to fear, nor shall they grieve.\\n39. But as for those who disbelieve and reject \\nOur signs—these are the inmates of the \\nFire—wherein they will remain forever.”\\n40. O Children of Israel! Remember My bless\\ufffeings which I bestowed upon you, and fulfill \\nyour pledge to Me, and I will fulfill My pledge \\nto you, and fear Me.\\n41. And believe in what I revealed, confirming \\nwhat is with you; and do not be the first to \\n2\\n2. THE HEIFER (al-Baqarah)\\ndeny it; and do not exchange My revelations \\nfor a small price; and be conscious of Me.\\n42. And do not mix truth with falsehood, and \\ndo not conceal the truth while you know.\\n43. And attend to your prayers, and practice \\nregular charity, and kneel with those who \\nkneel.\\n44. Do you command people to virtuous con\\ufffeduct, and forget yourselves, even though you \\nread the Scripture? Do you not understand?\\n45. And seek help through patience and \\nprayer. But it is difficult, except for the de\\ufffevout.\\n46. Those who know that they will meet their \\nLord, and that to Him they will return.\\n47. O Children of Israel! Remember My favor \\nwhich I bestowed upon you, and I that fa\\ufffevored you over all nations.\\n48. And beware of a Day when no soul will \\navail another in the least, nor will any inter\\ufffecession be accepted on its behalf, nor will any \\nransom be taken from it, nor will they be \\nhelped.\\n49. And recall that We delivered you from the \\npeople of Pharaoh. They inflicted on you ter\\uffferible persecution, killing your sons and spar\\ufffeing your women. Therein was a tremendous \\ntrial from your Lord.\\n50. And recall that We parted the sea for you, \\nso We saved you, and We drowned the peo\\ufffeple of Pharaoh as you looked on.\\n51. And recall that We appointed for Moses \\nforty nights. Then you took to worshiping the \\ncalf after him, and you turned wicked.\\n52. Then We pardoned you after that, so that \\nyou might be grateful.\\n53. And recall that We gave Moses the Scrip\\ufffeture and the Criterion, so that you may be \\nguided.\\n54. And recall that Moses said to his people, “O \\nmy people, you have done wrong to your\\ufffeselves by worshiping the calf. So repent to \\nyour Maker, and kill your egos. That would \\nbe better for you with your Maker.” So He \\nturned to you in repentance. He is the Ac\\ufffecepter of Repentance, the Merciful.\\n55. And recall that you said, “O Moses, we will \\nnot believe in you unless we see Allah \\nplainly.” Thereupon the thunderbolt struck \\nyou, as you looked on.\\n56. Then We revived you after your death, so \\nthat you may be appreciative.\\n57. And We shaded you with clouds, and We \\nsent down to you manna and quails: “Eat of \\nthe good things We have provided for you.” \\nThey did not wrong Us, but they used to \\nwrong their own souls.\\n58. And recall that We said, “Enter this town, \\nand eat plentifully from it whatever you wish; \\nbut enter the gate humbly, and say, 'Pardon.' \\nWe will forgive your sins, and give increase to \\nthe virtuous.”\\n59. But the wrongdoers among them substi\\ufffetuted words other than those given to them, \\nso We sent down on the wrongdoers a plague \\nfrom heaven, because of their wicked behav\\ufffeior.\\n60. And recall when Moses prayed for water \\nfor his people. We said, “Strike the rock with \\nyour staff.” Thereupon twelve springs gushed \\nout from it, and each tribe recognized its \\ndrinking-place. “Eat and drink from Allah’s \\nprovision, and do not corrupt the earth with \\ndisobedience.”\\n61. And recall when you said, “O Moses, we \\ncannot endure one kind of food, so call to \\nyour Lord to produce for us of what the earth \\ngrows: of its herbs, and its cucumbers, and its \\ngarlic, and its lentils, and its onions.” He said, \\n“Would you substitute worse for better? Go \\ndown to Egypt, where you will have what you \\nasked for.” They were struck with humilia\\ufffetion and poverty, and incurred wrath from \\nAllah. That was because they rejected Allah’s \\nrevelations and wrongfully killed the proph\\ufffeets. That was because they disobeyed and \\ntransgressed.\\n62. Those who believe, and those who are Jew\\ufffeish, and the Christians, and the Sabeans—any \\nwho believe in Allah and the Last Day, and \\n3\\n2. THE HEIFER (al-Baqarah)\\nact righteously—will have their reward with \\ntheir Lord; they have nothing to fear, nor will \\nthey grieve.\\n63. And recall when We received a pledge \\nfrom you, and raised the Mount above you: \\n“Take what We have given you earnestly, and \\nremember what is in it, that you may attain \\nrighteousness.”\\n64. But after that you turned away. Were it not \\nfor Allah’s grace and mercy towards you, you \\nwould have been among the losers.\\n65. And you surely knew those of you who vi\\ufffeolated the Sabbath. We said to them, “Be des\\ufffepicable apes!”\\n66. Thus We made it a deterrent for their gen\\ufffeeration, and for subsequent generations, and \\na lesson for the righteous.\\n67. And recall when Moses said to his people, \\n“Allah commands you to sacrifice a heifer.” \\nThey said, “Do you make a mockery of us?” \\nHe said, “Allah forbid that I should be so ig\\ufffenorant.”\\n68. They said, “Call upon your Lord to show us \\nwhich one.” He said, “He says she is a heifer, \\nneither too old, nor too young, but in be\\ufffetween. So do what you are commanded.”\\n69. They said, “Call upon your Lord to show us \\nwhat her color is.” He said, “He says she is a \\nyellow heifer, bright in color, pleasing to the \\nbeholders.”\\n70. They said, “Call upon your Lord to show us \\nwhich one; the heifers look alike to us; and \\nAllah willing, we will be guided.”\\n71. He said, “He says she is a heifer, neither \\nyoked to plow the earth, nor to irrigate the \\nfield; sound without blemish.” They said, \\n“Now you have brought the truth.” So they \\nslew her; though they almost did not.\\n72. And recall when you killed a person, and \\ndisputed in the matter; but Allah was to ex\\ufffepose what you were hiding.\\n73. We said, “Strike him with part of it.” Thus \\nAllah brings the dead to life; and He shows \\nyou His signs, that you may understand.\\n74. Then after that your hearts hardened. They \\nwere as rocks, or even harder. For there are \\nsome rocks from which rivers gush out, and \\nothers that splinter and water comes out \\nfrom them, and others that sink in awe of Al\\ufffelah. Allah is not unaware of what you do.\\n75. Do you hope that they will believe in you, \\nwhen some of them used to hear the Word of \\nAllah, and then deliberately distort it, even \\nafter understanding it?\\n76. And when they come across those who be\\ufffelieve, they say, “We believe,” but when they \\ncome together privately, they say, “Will you \\ninform them of what Allah has disclosed to \\nyou, so that they might dispute with you con\\ufffecerning it before your Lord?” Do you not un\\ufffederstand?\\n77. Do they not know that Allah knows what \\nthey conceal and what they reveal?\\n78. And among them are uneducated who \\nknow the Scripture only through hearsay, \\nand they only speculate.\\n79. So woe to those who write the Scripture \\nwith their own hands, and then say, “This is \\nfrom Allah,” that they may exchange it for a \\nlittle price. Woe to them for what their hands \\nhave written, and woe to them for what they \\nearn. \\n80. And they say, “The Fire will not touch us \\nexcept for a number of days.” Say, “Have you \\nreceived a promise from Allah—Allah never \\nbreaks His promise—or are you saying about \\nAllah what you do not know?”\\n81. Indeed, whoever commits misdeeds, and \\nbecomes besieged by his iniquities—these are \\nthe inmates of the Fire, wherein they will \\ndwell forever. \\n82. As for those who believe and do righteous \\ndeeds—these are the inhabitants of Paradise, \\nwherein they will dwell forever.\\n83. We made a covenant with the Children of \\nIsrael: “Worship none but Allah; and be good \\nto parents, and relatives, and orphans, and \\nthe needy; and speak nicely to people; and \\npray regularly, and give alms.” Then you \\n4\\n2. THE HEIFER (al-Baqarah)\\nturned away, except for a few of you, recant\\ufffeing.\\n84. And We made a covenant with you: “You \\nshall not shed the blood of your own, nor \\nshall you evict your own from your homes.” \\nYou agreed, and were all witnesses.\\n85. But here you are, killing your own, and ex\\ufffepelling a group of your own from their \\nhomes—conspiring against them in wrong\\ufffedoing and hostility. And if they come to you \\nas captives, you ransom them, although it was \\nforbidden to you. Is it that you believe in part \\nof the Scripture, and disbelieve in part? What \\nis the reward for those among you who do \\nthat but humiliation in this life? And on the \\nDay of Resurrection, they will be assigned to \\nthe most severe torment. Allah is not una\\ufffeware of what you do. \\n86. Those are they who bought the present life \\nfor the Hereafter, so the punishment will not \\nbe lightened for them, nor will they be \\nhelped.\\n87. We gave Moses the Scripture, and sent a \\nsuccession of messengers after him. And We \\ngave Jesus son of Mary the clear proofs, and \\nWe supported him with the Holy Spirit. Is it \\nthat whenever a messenger comes to you with \\nanything your souls do not desire, you grew \\narrogant, calling some impostors, and killing \\nothers?\\n88. And they said, “Our hearts are sealed.” Ra\\ufffether, Allah has cursed them for their ingrati\\ufffetude. They have little faith.\\n89. And when a scripture came to them from \\nAllah, confirming what they have—although \\npreviously they were seeking victory against \\nthose who disbelieved—but when there came \\nto them what they recognized, they disbe\\ufffelieved in it. So Allah’s curse is upon the dis\\ufffebelievers.\\n90. Miserable is what they sold their souls \\nfor—rejecting what Allah has revealed, out of \\nresentment that Allah would send down His \\ngrace upon whomever He chooses from \\namong His servants. Thus they incurred \\nwrath upon wrath. And there is a demeaning \\npunishment for the disbelievers. \\n91. And when it is said to them, “Believe in \\nwhat Allah has revealed,” they say, “We be\\ufffelieve in what was revealed to us,” and they re\\ufffeject anything beyond that, although it is the \\ntruth which confirms what they have. Say, \\n“Why did you kill Allah’s prophets before, if \\nyou were believers?”\\n92. Moses came to you with clear proofs, yet \\nyou adopted the calf in his absence, and you \\nwere in the wrong.\\n93. And We made a covenant with you, and \\nraised the Mount above you: “Take what We \\nhave given you firmly, and listen.” They said, \\n“We hear and disobey.” And their hearts be\\ufffecame filled with the love of the calf because of \\ntheir disbelief. Say, “Wretched is what your \\nfaith commands you to do, if you are believ\\ufffeers.” \\n94. Say, “If the Final Home with Allah is yours \\nalone, to the exclusion of all other people, \\nthen wish for death if you are sincere.”\\n95. But they will never wish for it, because of \\nwhat their hands have forwarded. Allah is \\naware of the evildoers.\\n96. You will find them, of all mankind, the \\nmost eager for life, even more than the poly\\ufffetheists. Every one of them wishes he could \\nlive a thousand years; but to be granted a long \\nlife will not nudge him from the punishment. \\nAllah is Seeing of what they do.\\n97. Say, “Whoever is hostile to Gabriel—it is \\nhe who revealed it to your heart by Allah’s \\nleave, confirming what preceded it, and guid\\ufffeance and good news for the believers.”\\n98. Whoever is hostile to Allah, and His angels, \\nand His messengers, and Gabriel, and Mi\\ufffechael—Allah is hostile to the faithless.\\n99. We have revealed to you clear signs, and \\nnone rejects them except the sinners.\\n100. Is it not that whenever they make a cove\\ufffenant, some of them toss it aside? In fact, most \\nof them do not believe.\\n101. And when there came to them a messen\\ufffeger from Allah, confirming what they had, a \\nfaction of those who were given the Book \\n5\\n2. THE HEIFER (al-Baqarah)\\nthrew the Book of Allah behind their backs, \\nas if they do not know.\\n102. And they followed what the devils taught \\nduring the reign of Solomon. It was not Solo\\ufffemon who disbelieved, but it was the devils \\nwho disbelieved. They taught the people \\nwitchcraft and what was revealed in Babylon \\nto the two angels Harut and Marut. They did \\nnot teach anybody until they had said, “We \\nare a test, so do not lose faith.” But they \\nlearned from them the means to cause sepa\\uffferation between man and his wife. But they \\ncannot harm anyone except with Allah's per\\ufffemission. And they learned what would harm \\nthem and not benefit them. Yet they knew \\nthat whoever deals in it will have no share in \\nthe Hereafter. Miserable is what they sold \\ntheir souls for, if they only knew.\\n103. Had they believed and been righteous, the \\nreward from Allah would have been better, if \\nthey only knew.\\n104. O you who believe! Do not say ambiguous \\nwords, but say words of respect, and listen. \\nThe disbelievers will have a painful torment.\\n105. It is never the wish of the disbelievers from \\namong the People of the Book, nor of the pol\\ufffeytheists, that any good should be sent down \\nto you from your Lord. But Allah chooses for \\nHis mercy whomever He wills. Allah is Pos\\ufffesessor of Sublime Grace.\\n106. We never nullify a verse, nor cause it to be \\nforgotten, unless We bring one better than it, \\nor similar to it. Do you not know that Allah \\nis capable of all things?\\n107. Do you not know that to Allah belongs the \\nsovereignty of the heavens and the earth, and \\nthat apart from Allah you have no guardian \\nor helper?\\n108. Or do you want to question your Messen\\ufffeger as Moses was questioned before? Who\\ufffeever exchanges faith for disbelief has strayed \\nfrom the right path.\\n109. Many of the People of the Book wish to \\nturn you back into unbelievers after you have \\nbelieved, out of envy on their part, after the \\nTruth has become clear to them. But pardon \\nand overlook, until Allah brings His com\\ufffemand. Allah has power over all things.\\n110. And perform the prayer, and give alms. \\nWhatever good you forward for yourselves, \\nyou will find it with Allah. Allah is Seeing of \\neverything you do.\\n111. And they say, “None will enter Heaven un\\ufffeless he is a Jew or a Christian.” These are their \\nwishes. Say, “Produce your proof, if you are \\ntruthful.”\\n112. In fact, whoever submits himself to Allah, \\nand is a doer of good, will have his reward \\nwith his Lord—they have nothing to fear, nor \\nshall they grieve.\\n113. The Jews say, “The Christians are not \\nbased on anything;” and the Christians say, \\n“The Jews are not based on anything.” Yet \\nthey both read the Scripture. Similarly, the ig\\ufffenorant said the same thing. Allah will judge \\nbetween them on the Day of Resurrection re\\ufffegarding their differences.\\n114. Who is more unjust than him who forbids \\nthe remembrance of Allah’s name in places of \\nworship, and contributes to their ruin? These \\nought not to enter them except in fear. For \\nthem is disgrace in this world, and for them \\nis a terrible punishment in the Hereafter.\\n115. To Allah belong the East and the West. \\nWhichever way you turn, there is Allah’s \\npresence. Allah is Omnipresent and Omnis\\ufffecient.\\n116. And they say, “Allah has begotten a son.” \\nBe He glorified. Rather, His is everything in \\nthe heavens and the earth; all are obedient to \\nHim.\\n117. Originator of the heavens and the earth. \\nWhenever He decrees a thing, He says to it, \\n“Be,” and it becomes.\\n118. Those who do not know say, “If only Allah \\nwould speak to us, or a sign would come to \\nus.” Thus said those who were before them. \\nTheir hearts are alike. We have made the \\nsigns clear for people who are certain. \\n6\\n2. THE HEIFER (al-Baqarah)\\n119. We have sent you with the truth—bring\\ufffeing good news, and giving warnings. You will \\nnot be questioned about the inmates of Hell.\\n120. The Jews and the Christians will not ap\\ufffeprove of you, unless you follow their creed. \\nSay, “Allah’s guidance is the guidance.” \\nShould you follow their desires, after the \\nknowledge that has come to you, you will \\nhave in Allah neither guardian nor helper.\\n121. Those to whom We have given the Scrip\\ufffeture follow it, as it ought to be followed—\\nthese believe in it. But as for those who reject \\nit—these are the losers.\\n122. O Children of Israel! Remember My bless\\ufffeing which I bestowed upon you, and that I \\nhave favored you over all people.\\n123. And beware of a Day when no soul will \\navail another soul in any way, and no ransom \\nwill be accepted from it, and no intercession \\nwill benefit it, and they will not be helped.\\n124. And when his Lord tested Abraham with \\ncertain words, and he fulfilled them. He said, \\n“I am making you a leader of humanity.” He \\nsaid, “And my descendants?” He said, “My \\npledge does not include the wrongdoers.”\\n125. And We made the House a focal point for \\nthe people, and a sanctuary. Use the shrine of \\nAbraham as a place of prayer. And We com\\ufffemissioned Abraham and Ishmael, “Sanctify \\nMy House for those who circle around it, and \\nthose who seclude themselves in it, and those \\nwho kneel and prostrate.”\\n126. When Abraham said, “O My Lord, make \\nthis a peaceful land, and provide its people \\nwith fruits—whoever of them believes in Al\\ufffelah and the Last Day.” He said, “And whoever \\ndisbelieves, I will give him a little enjoyment, \\nthen I will consign him to the punishment of \\nthe Fire; how miserable the destiny!”\\n127. As Abraham raises the foundations of the \\nHouse, together with Ishmael, “Our Lord, ac\\ufffecept it from us, You are the Hearer, the \\nKnower.\\n128. Our Lord, and make us submissive to You, \\nand from our descendants a community sub\\ufffemissive to You. And show us our rites, and \\naccept our repentance. You are the Acceptor \\nof Repentance, the Merciful.\\n129. Our Lord, and raise up among them a \\nmessenger, of themselves, who will recite to \\nthem Your revelations, and teach them the \\nBook and wisdom, and purify them. You are \\nthe Almighty, the Wise.”\\n130. Who would forsake the religion of Abra\\ufffeham, except he who fools himself? We chose \\nhim in this world, and in the Hereafter he will \\nbe among the righteous. \\n131. When his Lord said to him, “Submit!” He \\nsaid, “I have submitted to the Lord of the \\nWorlds.”\\n132. And Abraham exhorted his sons, and Ja\\ufffecob, “O my sons, Allah has chosen this reli\\ufffegion for you, so do not die unless you have \\nsubmitted.”\\n133. Or were you witnesses when death ap\\ufffeproached Jacob, and he said to his sons, \\n“What will you worship after Me?” They said, \\n“We will worship your God, and the God of \\nyour fathers, Abraham, Ishmael, and Isaac; \\nOne God; and to Him we submit.”\\n134. That was a community that has passed; for \\nthem is what they have earned, and for you is \\nwhat you have earned; and you will not be \\nquestioned about what they used to do.\\n135. And they say, “Be Jews or Christians, and \\nyou will be guided.” Say, “Rather, the religion \\nof Abraham, the Monotheist; he was not an \\nidolater.”\\n136. Say, “We believe in Allah; and in what was \\nrevealed to us; and in what was revealed to \\nAbraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, \\nand the Patriarchs; and in what was given to \\nMoses and Jesus; and in what was given to the \\nprophets—from their Lord. We make no dis\\ufffetinction between any of them, and to Him we \\nsurrender.”\\n137. If they believe in the same as you have be\\ufffelieved in, then they have been guided. But if \\nthey turn away, then they are in schism. Allah \\nwill protect you against them; for He is the \\nHearer, the Knower. \\n7\\n2. THE HEIFER (al-Baqarah)\\n138. Allah’s coloring. And who gives better col\\ufffeoring than Allah? “And we are devoted to \\nHim.”\\n139. Say, “Do you argue with us about Allah, \\nwhen He is our Lord and your Lord, and We \\nhave our works, and you have your works, \\nand we are sincere to Him?”\\n140. Or do you say that Abraham, Ishmael, \\nIsaac, Jacob, and the Patriarchs were Jews or \\nChristians? Say, “Do you know better, or Al\\ufffelah?” And who does greater wrong than he \\nwho conceals a testimony he has from Allah? \\nAllah is not unaware of what you do.\\n141. That was a community that has passed. To \\nthem is what they have earned, and to you is \\nwhat you have earned. And you will not be \\nquestioned about what they used to do.\\n142. The ignorant among the people will say, \\n“What has turned them away from the direc\\ufffetion of prayer they once followed?” Say, “To \\nAllah belong the East and the West. He \\nguides whom He wills to a straight path.”\\n143. Thus We made you a moderate commu\\ufffenity, that you may be witnesses to humanity, \\nand that the Messenger may be a witness to \\nyou. We only established the direction of \\nprayer, which you once followed, that We \\nmay distinguish those who follow the Mes\\ufffesenger from those who turn on their heels. It \\nis indeed difficult, except for those whom Al\\ufffelah has guided. But Allah would never let \\nyour faith go to waste. Allah is Kind towards \\nthe people, Merciful.\\n144. We have seen your face turned towards \\nthe heaven. So We will turn you towards a di\\uffferection that will satisfy you. So turn your face \\ntowards the Sacred Mosque. And wherever \\nyou may be, turn your faces towards it. Those \\nwho were given the Book know that it is the \\nTruth from their Lord; and Allah is not una\\ufffeware of what they do. \\n145. Even if you were to bring to those who \\nwere given the Book every proof, they would \\nnot follow your direction, nor are you to fol\\ufffelow their direction, nor do they follow the di\\uffferection of one another. And if you were to \\nfollow their desires, after the knowledge that \\nhas come to you, you would be in that case \\none of the wrongdoers.\\n146. Those to whom We have given the Book \\nrecognize it as they recognize their own chil\\ufffedren. But some of them conceal the truth \\nwhile they know.\\n147. The truth is from your Lord, so do not be \\na skeptic.\\n148. To every community is a direction to\\ufffewards which it turns. Therefore, race towards \\ngoodness. Wherever you may be, Allah will \\nbring you all together. Allah is capable of eve\\uffferything.\\n149. And wherever you come from, turn your \\nface towards the Sacred Mosque. This is the \\ntruth from your Lord, and Allah is not heed\\ufffeless of what you do.\\n150. And wherever you come from, turn your \\nface towards the Sacred Mosque. And wher\\ufffeever you may be, turn your faces towards it. \\nSo that the people may not have any argu\\ufffement against you—except those who do \\nwrong among them. So do not fear them, but \\nfear Me, that I may complete My blessings \\nupon you, and that you may be guided.\\n151. Just as We sent to you a messenger from \\namong you, who recites Our revelations to \\nyou, and purifies you, and teaches you the \\nBook and wisdom, and teaches you what you \\ndid not know.\\n152. So remember Me, and I will remember \\nyou. And thank Me, and do not be ungrate\\ufffeful.\\n153. O you who believe! Seek help through pa\\ufffetience and prayers. Allah is with the steadfast.\\n154. And do not say of those who are killed in \\nthe cause of Allah, “Dead.” Rather, they are \\nalive, but you do not perceive.\\n155. We will certainly test you with some fear \\nand hunger, and some loss of possessions and \\nlives and crops. But give good news to the \\nsteadfast.\\n156. Those who, when a calamity afflicts them, \\nsay, “To Allah we belong, and to Him we will \\nreturn.”\\n8\\n2. THE HEIFER (al-Baqarah)\\n157. Upon these are blessings and mercy from \\ntheir Lord. These are the guided ones. \\n158. Safa and Marwa are among the rites of Al\\ufffelah. Whoever makes the Pilgrimage to the \\nHouse, or performs the Umrah, commits no \\nerror by circulating between them. Whoever \\nvolunteers good—Allah is Appreciative and \\nCognizant.\\n159. Those who suppress the proofs and the \\nguidance We have revealed, after We have \\nclarified them to humanity in the Scripture—\\nthose—Allah curses them, and the cursers \\ncurse them.\\n160. Except those who repent, and reform, and \\nproclaim. Those—I will accept their repent\\ufffeance. I am the Acceptor of Repentance, the \\nMerciful.\\n161. But as for those who reject faith, and die \\nrejecting—those—upon them is the curse of \\nAllah, and of the angels, and of all humanity.\\n162. They will remain under it forever, and the \\ntorment will not be lightened for them, and \\nthey will not be reprieved.\\n163. Your God is one God. There is no god but \\nHe, the Benevolent, the Compassionate.\\n164. In the creation of the heavens and the \\nearth; in the alternation of night and day; in \\nthe ships that sail the oceans for the benefit of \\nmankind; in the water that Allah sends down \\nfrom the sky, and revives the earth with it af\\ufffeter it had died, and scatters in it all kinds of \\ncreatures; in the changing of the winds, and \\nthe clouds disposed between the sky and the \\nearth; are signs for people who understand.\\n165. Yet among the people are those who take \\nother than Allah as equals to Him. They love \\nthem as the love of Allah. But those who be\\ufffelieve have greater love for Allah. If only the \\nwrongdoers would realize, when they see the \\ntorment; that all power is Allah’s, and that Al\\ufffelah is severe in punishment.\\n166. Those who were followed will then disown \\nthose who followed them, and they will see \\nthe retribution, and ties between them will be \\nsevered.\\n167. Those who followed will say, “If only we \\ncan have another chance, we will disown \\nthem, as they disowned us.” Thus Allah will \\nshow them their deeds, as regrets to them, \\nand they will not come out of the Fire.\\n168. O people! Eat of what is lawful and good \\non earth, and do not follow the footsteps of \\nSatan. He is to you an open enemy.\\n169. He commands you to do evil and vice, and \\nto say about Allah what you do not know.\\n170. And when it is said to them, “Follow what \\nAllah has revealed,” they say, “We will follow \\nwhat we found our ancestors following.” \\nEven if their ancestors understood nothing, \\nand were not guided?\\n171. The parable of those who disbelieve is that \\nof someone who calls upon someone who \\nhears nothing except screaming and yelling. \\nDeaf, dumb, and blind—they do not under\\ufffestand.\\n172. O you who believe! Eat of the good things \\nWe have provided for you, and give thanks to \\nAllah, if it is Him that you serve.\\n173. He has forbidden you carrion, and blood, \\nand the flesh of swine, and what was dedi\\ufffecated to other than Allah. But if anyone is \\ncompelled, without desiring or exceeding, he \\ncommits no sin. Allah is Forgiving and Mer\\ufffeciful.\\n174. Those who conceal what Allah revealed in \\nthe Book, and exchange it for a small price—\\nthose swallow nothing but fire into their bel\\ufffelies. And Allah will not speak to them on the \\nDay of Resurrection, nor will He purify them, \\nand they will have a painful punishment. \\n175. It is they who exchange guidance for error, \\nand forgiveness for punishment. But why do \\nthey insist on the Fire?\\n176. That is because Allah has revealed the \\nBook in truth; and those who differ about the \\nBook are in deep discord.\\n177. Righteousness does not consist of turning \\nyour faces towards the East and the West. But \\nrighteous is he who believes in Allah, and the \\nLast Day, and the angels, and the Scripture, \\n9\\n2. THE HEIFER (al-Baqarah)\\nand the prophets. Who gives money, though \\ndear, to near relatives, and orphans, and the \\nneedy, and the homeless, and the beggars, \\nand for the freeing of slaves; those who per\\ufffeform the prayers, and pay the obligatory \\ncharity, and fulfill their promise when they \\npromise, and patiently persevere in the face \\nof persecution, hardship, and in the time of \\nconflict. These are the sincere; these are the \\npious.\\n178. O you who believe! Retaliation for the \\nmurdered is ordained upon you: the free for \\nthe free, the slave for the slave, the female for \\nthe female. But if he is forgiven by his kin, \\nthen grant any reasonable demand, and pay \\nwith good will. This is a concession from \\nyour Lord, and a mercy. But whoever com\\ufffemits aggression after that, a painful torment \\nawaits him.\\n179. There is life for you in retaliation, O peo\\ufffeple of understanding, so that you may refrain.\\n180. It is decreed for you: when death ap\\ufffeproaches one of you, and he leaves wealth, to \\nmake a testament in favor of the parents and \\nthe relatives, fairly and correctly—a duty \\nupon the righteous. \\n181. But whoever changes it after he has heard \\nit, the guilt is upon those who change it. Allah \\nis All-Hearing, All-Knowing.\\n182. Should someone suspect bias or injustice \\non the part of a testator, and then reconciles \\nbetween them, he commits no sin. Allah is \\nForgiving and Merciful. \\n183. O you who believe! Fasting is prescribed \\nfor you, as it was prescribed for those before \\nyou, that you may become righteous.\\n184. For a specified number of days. But who\\ufffeever among you is sick, or on a journey, then \\na number of other days. For those who are \\nable: a ransom of feeding a needy person. But \\nwhoever volunteers goodness, it is better for \\nhim. But to fast is best for you, if you only \\nknew.\\n185. Ramadan is the month in which the Quran \\nwas revealed. Guidance for humanity, and \\nclear portents of guidance, and the Criterion. \\nWhoever of you witnesses the month, shall \\nfast it. But whoever is sick, or on a journey, \\nthen a number of other days. Allah desires \\nease for you, and does not desire hardship for \\nyou, that you may complete the number, and \\ncelebrate Allah for having guided you, so that \\nyou may be thankful.\\n186. And when My servants ask you about Me, \\nI Am near; I answer the call of the caller when \\nhe calls on Me. So let them answer Me, and \\nhave faith in Me, that they may be rightly \\nguided.\\n187. Permitted for you is intercourse with your \\nwives on the night of the fast. They are a gar\\ufffement for you, and you are a garment for \\nthem. Allah knows that you used to betray \\nyourselves, but He turned to you and par\\ufffedoned you. So approach them now, and seek \\nwhat Allah has ordained for you, and eat and \\ndrink until the white streak of dawn can be\\ndistinguished from the black streak. Then \\ncomplete the fast until nightfall. But do not \\napproach them while you are in retreat at the \\nmosques. These are the limits of Allah, so do \\nnot come near them. Allah thus clarifies His \\nrevelations to the people, that they may attain \\npiety.\\n188. And do not consume one another’s wealth \\nby unjust means, nor offer it as bribes to the \\nofficials in order to consume part of other \\npeople’s wealth illicitly, while you know.\\n189. They ask you about the crescents. Say, \\n“They are timetables for people, and for the \\nHajj.” It is not virtuous that you approach \\nhomes from their backs, but virtue is to be pi\\ufffeous. So approach homes from their doors, \\nand observe Allah, that you may succeed.\\n190. And fight in the cause of Allah those who \\nfight you, but do not commit aggression; Al\\ufffelah does not love the aggressors.\\n191. And kill them wherever you overtake \\nthem, and expel them from where they had \\nexpelled you. Oppression is more serious \\nthan murder. But do not fight them at the Sa\\ufffecred Mosque, unless they fight you there. If \\nthey fight you, then kill them. Such is the ret\\uffferibution of the disbelievers.\\n10\\n2. THE HEIFER (al-Baqarah)\\n192. But if they cease, then Allah is Forgiving \\nand Merciful.\\n193. And fight them until there is no oppres\\ufffesion, and worship becomes devoted to Allah \\nalone. But if they cease, then let there be no \\nhostility except against the oppressors.\\n194. The sacred month for the sacred month; \\nand sacrilege calls for retaliation. Whoever \\ncommits aggression against you, retaliate \\nagainst him in the same measure as he has \\ncommitted against you. And be conscious of \\nAllah, and know that Allah is with the right\\ufffeeous.\\n195. And spend in the cause of Allah, and do \\nnot throw yourselves with your own hands \\ninto ruin, and be charitable. Allah loves the \\ncharitable.\\n196. And carry out the Hajj and the Umrah for \\nAllah. But if you are prevented, then what\\ufffeever is feasible of offerings. And do not shave \\nyour heads until the offering has reached its \\ndestination. Whoever of you is sick, or has an \\ninjury of the head, then redemption of fast\\ufffeing, or charity, or worship. When you are se\\ufffecure: whoever continues the Umrah until the \\nHajj, then whatever is feasible of offering. But \\nif he lacks the means, then fasting for three \\ndays during the Hajj and seven when you \\nhave returned, making ten in all. This is for \\nhe whose household is not present at the Sa\\ufffecred Mosque. And remain conscious of Al\\ufffelah, and know that Allah is stern in retribu\\ufffetion.\\n197. The Hajj is during specific months. Who\\ufffeever decides to perform the Hajj—there shall \\nbe no sexual relations, nor misconduct, nor \\nquarrelling during the Hajj. And whatever \\ngood you do, Allah knows it. And take provi\\ufffesions, but the best provision is righteousness. \\nAnd be mindful of Me, O people of under\\ufffestanding.\\n198. You commit no error by seeking bounty \\nfrom your Lord. When you disperse from Ar\\ufffeafat, remember Allah at the Sacred Land\\ufffemark. And remember Him as He has guided \\nyou. Although, before that, you were of those \\nastray.\\n199. Then disperse from where the people dis\\ufffeperse, and ask Allah for forgiveness. Allah is \\nMost Forgiving, Most Merciful.\\n200. When you have completed your rites, re\\ufffemember Allah as you remember your par\\ufffeents, or even more. Among the people is he \\nwho says, “Our Lord, give us in this world,” \\nyet he has no share in the Hereafter.\\n201. And among them is he who says, “Our \\nLord, give us goodness in this world, and \\ngoodness in the Hereafter, and protect us \\nfrom the torment of the Fire.”\\n202. These will have a share of what they have \\nearned. Allah is swift in reckoning.\\n203. And remember Allah during the desig\\ufffenated days. But whoever hurries on in two \\ndays commits no wrong, and whoever stays \\non commits no wrong—provided he main\\ufffetains righteousness. And obey Allah, and \\nknow that to Him you will be gathered.\\n204. Among the people is he whose speech \\nabout the worldly life impresses you, and he \\ncalls Allah to witness what is in his heart, \\nwhile he is the most hostile of adversaries.\\n205. When he gains power, he strives to spread \\ncorruption on earth, destroying properties \\nand lives. Allah does not like corruption.\\n206. And when he is told, “Beware of Allah,” \\nhis pride leads him to more sin. Hell is \\nenough for him—a dreadful abode.\\n207. And among the people is he who sells \\nhimself seeking Allah’s approval. Allah is \\nkind towards the servants. \\n208. O you who believe! Enter into submission, \\nwholeheartedly, and do not follow the foot\\ufffesteps of Satan; he is to you an outright enemy.\\n209. But if you slip after the proofs have come \\nto you, know that Allah is Powerful and Wise.\\n210. Are they waiting for Allah Himself to \\ncome to them in the shadows of the clouds, \\ntogether with the angels, and thus the matter \\nis settled? All things are returned to Allah.\\n211. Ask the Children of Israel how many clear \\nsigns We have given them. Whoever alters \\n11\\n2. THE HEIFER (al-Baqarah)\\nthe blessing of Allah after it has come to \\nhim—Allah is severe in retribution.\\n212. Beautified is the life of this world for those \\nwho disbelieve, and they ridicule those who \\nbelieve. But the righteous will be above them \\non the Day of Resurrection. Allah provides to \\nwhomever He wills without measure.\\n213. Humanity used to be one community; \\nthen Allah sent the prophets, bringing good \\nnews and giving warnings. And He sent \\ndown with them the Scripture, with the truth, \\nto judge between people regarding their dif\\ufffeferences. But none differed over it except \\nthose who were given it—after the proofs had \\ncome to them—out of mutual envy between \\nthem. Then Allah guided those who believed \\nto the truth they had disputed, in accordance \\nwith His will. Allah guides whom He wills to \\na straight path. \\n214. Or do you expect to enter Paradise before \\nthe example of those who came before you \\nhad reached you? Adversity and hardship \\nhad afflicted them, and they were so shaken \\nup, that the Messenger and those who be\\ufffelieved with him said, “When is Allah’s vic\\ufffetory?” Indeed, Allah’s victory is near.\\n215. They ask you what they should give. Say, \\n“Whatever charity you give is for the parents, \\nand the relatives, and the orphans, and the \\npoor, and the wayfarer. Whatever good you \\ndo, Allah is aware of it.\\n216. Fighting is ordained for you, even though \\nyou dislike it. But it may be that you dislike \\nsomething while it is good for you, and it may \\nbe that you like something while it is bad for \\nyou. Allah knows, and you do not know.\\n217. They ask you about fighting during the \\nHoly Month. Say, “Fighting during it is de\\ufffeplorable; but to bar others from Allah’s path, \\nand to disbelieve in Him, and to prevent ac\\ufffecess to the Holy Mosque, and to expel its peo\\ufffeple from it, are more deplorable with Allah. \\nAnd persecution is more serious than killing. \\nThey will not cease to fight you until they \\nturn you back from your religion, if they can. \\nWhoever among you turns back from his re\\ufffeligion, and dies a disbeliever—those are they \\nwhose works will come to nothing, in this life, \\nand in the Hereafter. Those are the inmates \\nof the Fire, abiding in it forever.\\n218. Those who believed, and those who mi\\ufffegrated and fought for the sake of Allah—\\nthose look forward to Allah’s mercy. Allah is \\nForgiving and Merciful.\\n219. They ask you about intoxicants and gam\\ufffebling. Say, “There is gross sin in them, and \\nsome benefits for people, but their sinfulness \\noutweighs their benefit.” And they ask you \\nabout what they should give: say, “The sur\\ufffeplus.” Thus Allah explains the revelations to \\nyou, so that you may think.\\n220. About this world and the next. And they \\nask you about orphans. Say, “Improvement \\nfor them is best. And if you intermix with \\nthem, then they are your brethren.” Allah \\nknows the dishonest from the honest. Had \\nAllah willed, He could have overburdened \\nyou. Allah is Mighty and Wise.\\n221. Do not marry idolatresses, unless they \\nhave believed. A believing maid is better than \\nan idolatress, even if you like her. And do not \\nmarry idolaters, unless they have believed. A \\nbelieving servant is better than an idolater, \\neven if you like him. These call to the Fire, but \\nAllah calls to the Garden and to forgiveness, \\nby His leave. He makes clear His communi\\ufffecations to the people, that they may be mind\\ufffeful.\\n222. And they ask you about menstruation: \\nsay, “It is harmful, so keep away from women \\nduring menstruation. And do not approach \\nthem until they have become pure. Once they \\nhave become pure, approach them in the way \\nAllah has directed you.” Allah loves the re\\ufffepentant, and He loves those who keep clean.”\\n223. Your women are cultivation for you; so \\napproach your cultivation whenever you like, \\nand send ahead for yourselves. And fear Al\\ufffelah, and know that you will meet Him. And \\ngive good news to the believers.\\n224. And do not allow your oaths in Allah's \\nname to hinder you from virtue, and right\\ufffeeousness, and making peace between people. \\nAllah is Listener and Knower.\\n12\\n2. THE HEIFER (al-Baqarah)\\n225. Allah does not hold you responsible for \\nyour unintentional oaths, but He holds you \\nresponsible for your intentions. Allah is For\\ufffegiving and Forbearing.\\n226. Those who vow abstinence from their \\nwives must wait for four months. But if they \\nreconcile—Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.\\n227. And if they resolve to divorce—Allah is \\nHearing and Knowing.\\n228. Divorced women shall wait by themselves \\nfor three periods. And it is not lawful for \\nthem to conceal what Allah has created in \\ntheir wombs, if they believe in Allah and the \\nLast Day. Meanwhile, their husbands have \\nthe better right to take them back, if they de\\ufffesire reconciliation. And women have rights \\nsimilar to their obligations, according to what \\nis fair. But men have a degree over them. Al\\ufffelah is Mighty and Wise.\\n229. Divorce is allowed twice. Then, either \\nhonorable retention, or setting free kindly. It \\nis not lawful for you to take back anything \\nyou have given them, unless they fear that \\nthey cannot maintain Allah's limits. If you \\nfear that they cannot maintain Allah’s limits, \\nthen there is no blame on them if she sacri\\ufffefices something for her release. These are Al\\ufffelah’s limits, so do not transgress them. Those \\nwho transgress Allah’s limits are the unjust.\\n230. If he divorces her, she shall not be lawful \\nfor him again until she has married another \\nhusband. If the latter divorces her, then there \\nis no blame on them for reuniting, provided \\nthey think they can maintain Allah's limits. \\nThese are Allah’s limits; He makes them clear \\nto people who know.\\n231. When you divorce women, and they have \\nreached their term, either retain them amica\\ufffebly, or release them amicably. But do not re\\ufffetain them to hurt them and commit aggres\\ufffesion. Whoever does that has wronged him\\ufffeself. And do not take Allah’s revelations for a \\njoke. And remember Allah's favor to you, and \\nthat He revealed to you the Scripture and \\nWisdom to teach you. And fear Allah, and \\nknow that Allah is aware of everything.\\n232. When you divorce women, and they have \\nreached their term, do not prevent them from \\nmarrying their husbands, provided they \\nagree on fair terms. Thereby is advised who\\ufffeever among you believes in Allah and the Last \\nDay. That is better and more decent for you. \\nAllah knows, and you do not know.\\n233. Mothers may nurse their infants for two \\nwhole years, for those who desire to complete \\nthe nursing-period. It is the duty of the father \\nto provide for them and clothe them in a \\nproper manner. No soul shall be burdened \\nbeyond its capacity. No mother shall be \\nharmed on account of her child, and no fa\\ufffether shall be harmed on account of his child. \\nThe same duty rests upon the heir. If the cou\\ufffeple desire weaning, by mutual consent and \\nconsultation, they commit no error by doing \\nso. You commit no error by hiring nursing\\ufffemothers, as long as you pay them fairly. And \\nbe wary of Allah, and know that Allah is See\\ufffeing of what you do.\\n234. As for those among you who die and leave \\nwidows behind, their widows shall wait by \\nthemselves for four months and ten days. \\nWhen they have reached their term, there is \\nno blame on you regarding what they might \\nhonorably do with themselves. Allah is fully \\nacquainted with what you do.\\n235. You commit no error by announcing your \\nengagement to women, or by keeping it to \\nyourselves. Allah knows that you will be \\nthinking about them. But do not meet them \\nsecretly, unless you have something proper to \\nsay. And do not confirm the marriage tie un\\ufffetil the writing is fulfilled. And know that Al\\ufffelah knows what is in your souls, so beware of \\nHim. And know that Allah is Forgiving and \\nForbearing.\\n236. You commit no error by divorcing women \\nbefore having touched them, or before hav\\ufffeing set the dowry for them. And compensate \\nthem—the wealthy according to his means, \\nand the poor according to his means—with a \\nfair compensation, a duty upon the doers of \\ngood.\\n13\\n2. THE HEIFER (al-Baqarah)\\n237. If you divorce them before you have \\ntouched them, but after you had set the \\ndowry for them, give them half of what you \\nspecified—unless they forego the right, or the \\none in whose hand is the marriage contract\\nforegoes it. But to forego is nearer to piety. \\nAnd do not forget generosity between one \\nanother. Allah is seeing of everything you do.\\n238. Guard your prayers, and the middle \\nprayer, and stand before Allah in devotion.\\n239. But if you are in fear, then on foot, or rid\\ufffeing. And when you are safe, remember Allah, \\nas He taught you what you did not know.\\n240. Those of you who die and leave wives be\\ufffehind—a will shall provide their wives with \\nsupport for a year, provided they do not \\nleave. If they leave, you are not to blame for \\nwhat they do with themselves, provided it is \\nreasonable. Allah is Mighty and Wise.\\n241. And divorced women shall be provided \\nfor, equitably—a duty upon the righteous.\\n242. Allah thus explains His revelations to you, \\nso that you may understand.\\n243. Have you not considered those who fled \\ntheir homes, by the thousands, fearful of \\ndeath? Allah said to them, “Die.” Then He re\\ufffevived them. Allah is Gracious towards the \\npeople, but most people are not appreciative.\\n244. Fight in the cause of Allah, and know that \\nAllah is Hearing and Knowing.\\n245. Who is he who will offer Allah a generous \\nloan, so He will multiply it for him manifold? \\nAllah receives and amplifies, and to Him you \\nwill be returned.\\n246. Have you not considered the notables of \\nthe Children of Israel after Moses? When \\nthey said to a prophet of theirs, “Appoint a \\nking for us, and we will fight in the cause of \\nAllah.” He said, “Is it possible that, if fighting \\nwas ordained for you, you would not fight?” \\nThey said, “Why would we not fight in the \\ncause of Allah, when we were driven out of \\nour homes, along with our children?” But \\nwhen fighting was ordained for them, they \\nturned away, except for a few of them. But Al\\ufffelah is aware of the wrongdoers.\\n247. Their prophet said to them, “Allah has ap\\ufffepointed Saul to be your king.” They said, \\n“How can he have authority over us, when we \\nare more worthy of authority than he, and he \\nwas not given plenty of wealth?” He said, “Al\\ufffelah has chosen him over you, and has in\\ufffecreased him in knowledge and stature.” Allah \\nbestows His sovereignty upon whomever He \\nwills. Allah is Embracing and Knowing.\\n248. And their prophet said to them, “The \\nproof of his kingship is that the Ark will be \\nrestored to you, bringing tranquility from \\nyour Lord, and relics left by the family of Mo\\ufffeses and the family of Aaron. It will be carried \\nby the angels. In that is a sign for you, if you \\nare believers.” \\n249. When Saul set out with the troops, he said, \\n“Allah will be testing you with a river. Who\\ufffeever drinks from it does not belong with me. \\nBut whoever does not drink from it, does be\\ufffelong with me, except for whoever scoops up \\na little with his hand.” But they drank from it, \\nexcept for a few of them. Then, when he \\ncrossed it, he and those who believed with \\nhim, they said, “We have no strength to face \\nGoliath and his troops today.” But those who \\nknew that they would meet Allah said, “How \\nmany a small group has defeated a large \\ngroup by Allah’s will. Allah is with the stead\\ufffefast.”\\n250. And when they confronted Goliath and \\nhis troops, they said, “Our Lord, pour down \\npatience on us, and strengthen our foothold, \\nand support us against the faithless people.”\\n251. And they defeated them by Allah’s leave, \\nand David killed Goliath, and Allah gave him \\nsovereignty and wisdom, and taught him as \\nHe willed. Were it not for Allah restraining \\nthe people, some by means of others, the \\nearth would have gone to ruin. But Allah is \\ngracious towards mankind.\\n252. These are Allah’s revelations, which We \\nrecite to you in truth. You are one of the mes\\ufffesengers.\\n253. These messengers: We gave some ad\\ufffevantage over others. To some of them Allah \\nspoke directly, and some He raised in rank. \\n14\\n2. THE HEIFER (al-Baqarah)\\nWe gave Jesus son of Mary the clear miracles, \\nand We strengthened him with the Holy \\nSpirit. Had Allah willed, those who succeeded \\nthem would not have fought one another, af\\ufffeter the clear signs had come to them; but they \\ndisputed; some of them believed, and some of \\nthem disbelieved. Had Allah willed, they \\nwould not have fought one another; but Allah \\ndoes whatever He desires.\\n254. O you who believe! Spend from what We \\nhave given you, before a Day comes in which \\nthere is neither trading, nor friendship, nor \\nintercession. The disbelievers are the wrong\\ufffedoers.\\n255. Allah! There is no god except He, the Liv\\ufffeing, the Everlasting. Neither slumber over\\ufffetakes Him, nor sleep. To Him belongs every\\ufffething in the heavens and everything on earth. \\nWho is he that can intercede with Him except \\nwith His permission? He knows what is be\\ufffefore them, and what is behind them; and they \\ncannot grasp any of His knowledge, except as \\nHe wills. His Throne extends over the heav\\ufffeens and the earth, and their preservation does \\nnot burden Him. He is the Most High, the \\nGreat. \\n256. There shall be no compulsion in religion; \\nthe right way has become distinct from the \\nwrong way. Whoever renounces evil and be\\ufffelieves in Allah has grasped the most trustwor\\ufffethy handle; which does not break. Allah is \\nHearing and Knowing.\\n257. Allah is the Lord of those who believe; He \\nbrings them out of darkness and into light. As \\nfor those who disbelieve, their lords are the \\nevil ones; they bring them out of light and \\ninto darkness—these are the inmates of the \\nFire, in which they will abide forever.\\n258. Have you not considered him who argued \\nwith Abraham about his Lord, because Allah \\nhad given him sovereignty? Abraham said, \\n“My Lord is He who gives life and causes \\ndeath.” He said, “I give life and cause death.” \\nAbraham said, “Allah brings the sun from the \\nEast, so bring it from the West,” so the blas\\ufffephemer was confounded. Allah does not \\nguide the wrongdoing people.\\n259. Or like him who passed by a town col\\ufffelapsed on its foundations. He said, “How can \\nAllah revive this after its demise?” Thereupon \\nAllah caused him to die for a hundred years, \\nand then resurrected him. He said, “For how \\nlong have you tarried?” He said, “I have tar\\uffferied for a day, or part of a day.” He said, “No. \\nYou have tarried for a hundred years. Now \\nlook at your food and your drink—it has not \\nspoiled—and look at your donkey. We will \\nmake you a wonder for mankind. And look \\nat the bones, how We arrange them, and then \\nclothe them with flesh.” So when it became \\nclear to him, he said, “I know that Allah has \\npower over all things.” \\n260. And when Abraham said, “My Lord, show \\nme how You give life to the dead.” He said, \\n“Have you not believed?” He said, “Yes, but \\nto put my heart at ease.” He said, “Take four \\nbirds, and incline them to yourself, then place \\na part on each hill, then call to them; and they \\nwill come rushing to you. And know that Al\\ufffelah is Powerful and Wise.”\\n261. The parable of those who spend their \\nwealth in Allah’s way is that of a grain that \\nproduces seven spikes; in each spike is a hun\\ufffedred grains. Allah multiplies for whom He \\nwills. Allah is Bounteous and Knowing. \\n262. Those who spend their wealth in the way \\nof Allah, and then do not follow up what they \\nspent with reminders of their generosity or \\nwith insults, will have their reward with their \\nLord—they have nothing to fear, nor shall \\nthey grieve.\\n263. Kind words and forgiveness are better \\nthan charity followed by insults. Allah is Rich \\nand Clement.\\n264. O you who believe! Do not nullify your \\ncharitable deeds with reminders and hurtful \\nwords, like him who spends his wealth to be \\nseen by the people, and does not believe in \\nAllah and the Last Day. His likeness is that of \\na smooth rock covered with soil: a downpour \\nstrikes it, and leaves it bare—they gain noth\\ufffeing from their efforts. Allah does not guide \\nthe disbelieving people.\\n15\\n2. THE HEIFER (al-Baqarah)\\n265. And the parable of those who spend their \\nwealth seeking Allah’s approval, and to \\nstrengthen their souls, is that of a garden on \\na hillside. If heavy rain falls on it, its produce \\nis doubled; and if no heavy rain falls, then \\ndew is enough. Allah is seeing of everything \\nyou do.\\n266. Would anyone of you like to have a garden \\nof palms and vines, under which rivers \\nflow—with all kinds of fruit in it for him, and \\nold age has stricken him, and he has weak \\nchildren—then a tornado with fire batters it, \\nand it burns down? Thus Allah makes clear \\nthe signs for you, so that you may reflect.\\n267. O you who believe! Give of the good \\nthings you have earned, and from what We \\nhave produced for you from the earth. And \\ndo not pick the inferior things to give away, \\nwhen you yourselves would not accept it ex\\ufffecept with eyes closed. And know that Allah is \\nSufficient and Praiseworthy.\\n268. Satan promises you poverty, and urges \\nyou to immorality; but Allah promises you \\nforgiveness from Himself, and grace. Allah is \\nEmbracing and Knowing.\\n269. He gives wisdom to whomever He wills. \\nWhoever is given wisdom has been given \\nmuch good. But none pays heed except those \\nwith insight.\\n270. Whatever charity you give, or a pledge you \\nfulfill, Allah knows it. The wrongdoers have \\nno helpers.\\n271. If you give charity openly, that is good. But \\nif you keep it secret, and give it to the needy \\nin private, that is better for you. It will atone \\nfor some of your misdeeds. Allah is cognizant \\nof what you do.\\n272. Their guidance is not your responsibility, \\nbut Allah guides whom He wills. Any charity \\nyou give is for your own good. Any charity \\nyou give shall be for the sake of Allah. Any \\ncharity you give will be repaid to you in full, \\nand you will not be wronged.\\n273. It is for the poor; those who are restrained \\nin the way of Allah, and unable to travel in \\nthe land. The unaware would think them \\nrich, due to their dignity. You will recognize \\nthem by their features. They do not ask from \\npeople insistently. Whatever charity you give, \\nAllah is aware of it. \\n274. Those who spend their wealth by night \\nand day, privately and publicly, will receive \\ntheir reward from their Lord. They have \\nnothing to fear, nor shall they grieve. \\n275. Those who swallow usury will not rise, ex\\ufffecept as someone driven mad by Satan's touch. \\nThat is because they say, “Commerce is like \\nusury.” But Allah has permitted commerce, \\nand has forbidden usury. Whoever, on re\\ufffeceiving advice from his Lord, refrains, may \\nkeep his past earnings, and his case rests with \\nAllah. But whoever resumes—these are the \\ndwellers of the Fire, wherein they will abide \\nforever. \\n276. Allah condemns usury, and He blesses \\ncharities. Allah does not love any sinful in\\ufffegrate.\\n277. Those who believe, and do good deeds, \\nand pray regularly, and give charity—they \\nwill have their reward with their Lord; they \\nwill have no fear, nor shall they grieve. \\n278. O you who believe! Fear Allah, and forgo \\nwhat remains of usury, if you are believers. \\n279. If you do not, then take notice of a war by \\nAllah and His Messenger. But if you repent, \\nyou may keep your capital, neither wronging, \\nnor being wronged.\\n280. But if he is in hardship, then deferment \\nuntil a time of ease. But to remit it as charity \\nis better for you, if you only knew.\\n281. And guard yourselves against a Day when \\nyou will be returned to Allah; then each soul \\nwill be rewarded fully for what it has earned, \\nand they will not be wronged.\\n282. O you who believe! When you incur debt \\namong yourselves for a certain period of \\ntime, write it down. And have a scribe write \\nin your presence, in all fairness. And let no \\nscribe refuse to write, as Allah has taught \\nhim. So let him write, and let the debtor dic\\ufffetate. And let him fear Allah, his Lord, and di\\ufffeminish nothing from it. But if the debtor is \\n16\\n3. FAMILY OF IMRAN (Ali ‘Imran)\\nmentally deficient, or weak, or unable to dic\\ufffetate, then let his guardian dictate with hon\\ufffeesty. And call to witness two men from \\namong you. If two men are not available, then \\none man and two women whose testimony is \\nacceptable to all—if one of them fails to re\\ufffemember, the other would remind her. Wit\\ufffenesses must not refuse when called upon. \\nAnd do not think it too trivial to write down, \\nwhether small or large, including the time of \\nrepayment. That is more equitable with Al\\ufffelah, and stronger as evidence, and more likely \\nto prevent doubt—except in the case of a spot \\ntransaction between you—then there is no \\nblame on you if you do not write it down. \\nAnd let there be witnesses whenever you con\\ufffeclude a contract, and let no harm be done to \\neither scribe or witness. If you do that, it is \\ncorruption on your part. And fear Allah. Al\\ufffelah teaches you. Allah is aware of everything.\\n283. If you are on a journey, and cannot find a \\nscribe, then a security deposit should be \\nhanded over. But if you trust one another, let \\nthe trustee fulfill his trust, and let him fear Al\\ufffelah, his Lord. And do not conceal testimony. \\nWhoever conceals it is sinner at heart. Allah \\nis aware of what you do.\\n284. To Allah belongs everything in the heav\\ufffeens and the earth. Whether you reveal what is \\nwithin your selves, or conceal it, Allah will \\ncall you to account for it. He forgives whom \\nHe wills, and He punishes whom He wills. \\nAllah is Able to do all things.\\n285. The Messenger has believed in what was \\nrevealed to him from his Lord, as did the be\\ufffelievers. They all have believed in Allah, and \\nHis angels, and His scriptures, and His mes\\ufffesengers: “We make no distinction between \\nany of His messengers.” And they say, “We \\nhear and we obey. Your forgiveness, our \\nLord. To you is the destiny.”\\n286. Allah does not burden any soul beyond its \\ncapacity. To its credit is what it earns, and \\nagainst it is what it commits. “Our Lord, do \\nnot condemn us if we forget or make a mis\\ufffetake. Our Lord, do not burden us as You have \\nburdened those before us. Our Lord, do not \\nburden us with more than we have strength \\nto bear; and pardon us, and forgive us, and \\nhave mercy on us. You are our Lord and Mas\\ufffeter, so help us against the disbelieving peo\\ufffeple.”\\n3. FAMILY OF IMRAN\\n(Ali ‘Imran)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Alif, Lam, Meem.\\n2. Allah, there is no god but He, the Living, the \\nEternal.\\n3. He sent down to you the Book with the \\nTruth, confirming what came before it; and \\nHe sent down the Torah and the Gospel.\\n4. Aforetime, as guidance for mankind; and \\nHe sent down the Criterion. Those who have \\nrejected Allah’s signs will have a severe pun\\ufffeishment. Allah is Mighty, Able to take re\\ufffevenge.\\n5. Nothing is hidden from Allah, on earth or \\nin the heaven.\\n6. It is He who forms you in the wombs as He \\nwills. There is no god except He, the Al\\ufffemighty, the Wise.\\n7. It is He who revealed to you the Book. Some \\nof its verses are definitive; they are the foun\\ufffedation of the Book, and others are unspecific. \\nAs for those in whose hearts is deviation, they \\nfollow the unspecific part, seeking descent, \\nand seeking to derive an interpretation. But \\nnone knows its interpretation except Allah\\nand those firmly rooted in knowledge say, \\n“We believe in it; all is from our Lord.” But \\nnone recollects except those with under\\ufffestanding.\\n8. “Our Lord, do not cause our hearts to \\nswerve after You have guided us, and bestow \\non us mercy from Your presence; You are the \\nGiver.”\\n9. “Our Lord, You will gather the people for a \\nDay in which there is no doubt.” Allah will \\nnever break His promise.\\n17\\n3. FAMILY OF IMRAN (Ali ‘Imran)\\n10. As for those who disbelieve, neither their \\nwealth nor their children will avail them any\\ufffething against Allah. These will be fuel for the \\nFire.\\n11. Like the behavior of Pharaoh’s people and \\nthose before them. They rejected Our signs, \\nso Allah seized them for their sins. Allah is \\nStrict in retribution.\\n12. Say to those who disbelieve, “You will be \\ndefeated, and rounded up into Hell—an aw\\ufffeful resting-place.”\\n13. There was a sign for you in the two parties \\nthat met. One party fighting in the way of Al\\ufffelah, and the other was disbelieving. They saw \\nthem with their own eyes twice their number. \\nBut Allah supports with His help whomever \\nHe wills. In that is a lesson for those with in\\ufffesight.\\n14. Adorned for the people is the love of de\\ufffesires, such as women, and children, and piles \\nupon piles of gold and silver, and branded \\nhorses, and livestock, and fields. These are \\nthe conveniences of the worldly life, but with \\nAllah lies the finest resort.\\n15. Say, “Shall I inform you of something bet\\ufffeter than that? For those who are righteous, \\nwith their Lord are Gardens beneath which \\nrivers flow, where they will remain forever, \\nand purified spouses, and acceptance from \\nAllah.” Allah is Observant of the servants.\\n16. Those who say, “Our Lord, we have be\\ufffelieved, so forgive us our sins, and save us \\nfrom the suffering of the Fire.”\\n17. The patient, and the truthful, and the rev\\ufffeerent, and the charitable, and the seekers of \\nforgiveness at dawn.\\n18. Allah bears witness that there is no god but \\nHe, as do the angels, and those endowed with \\nknowledge—upholding justice. There is no \\ngod but He, the Mighty, the Wise.\\n19. Religion with Allah is Islam. Those to \\nwhom the Scripture was given differed only \\nafter knowledge came to them, out of envy \\namong themselves. Whoever rejects the signs \\nof Allah—Allah is quick to take account.\\n20. If they argue with you, say, “I have surren\\ufffedered myself to Allah, and those who follow \\nme.” And say to those who were given the \\nScripture, and to the unlearned, “Have you \\nsurrendered?” If they have surrendered, then \\nthey are guided; but if they turn away, then \\nyour duty is to convey. Allah is Seeing of the \\nservants.\\n21. As for those who defy Allah’s revelations, \\nand kill the prophets unjustly, and kill those \\nwho advocate justice among the people—\\npromise them a painful retribution.\\n22. They are those whose deeds will come to \\nnothing, in this world and in the Hereafter; \\nand they will have no saviors.\\n23. Have you not considered those who were \\ngiven a share of the Scripture, as they were \\ncalled to the Scripture of Allah to arbitrate be\\ufffetween them; then some of them turned back, \\nand declined?\\n24. That is because they said, “The Fire will not \\ntouch us except for a limited number of \\ndays.” They have been misled in their religion \\nby the lies they fabricated.\\n25. How about when We gather them for a \\nDay in which there is no doubt, and each soul \\nwill be paid in full for what it has earned, and \\nthey will not be wronged?\\n26. Say, “O Allah, Owner of Sovereignty. You \\ngrant sovereignty to whom You will, and You \\nstrip sovereignty from whom you will. You \\nhonor whom you will, and You humiliate \\nwhom you will. In Your hand is all goodness. \\nYou are Capable of all things.”\\n27. “You merge the night into the day, and \\nYou merge the day into the night; and you \\nbring the living out of the dead, and You \\nbring the dead out of the living; and You pro\\ufffevide for whom you will without measure.”\\n28. Believers are not to take disbelievers for \\nfriends instead of believers. Whoever does \\nthat has nothing to do with Allah, unless it is \\nto protect your own selves against them. Al\\ufffelah warns you to beware of Him. To Allah is \\nthe destiny.\\n18\\n3. FAMILY OF IMRAN (Ali ‘Imran)\\n29. Say, “Whether you conceal what is in your \\nhearts, or disclose it, Allah knows it.” He \\nknows everything in the heavens and the \\nearth. Allah is Powerful over everything.\\n30. On the Day when every soul finds all the \\ngood it has done presented. And as for the \\nevil it has done, it will wish there were a great \\ndistance between them. Allah cautions you of \\nHimself. Allah is Kind towards the servants.\\n31. Say, “If you love Allah, then follow me, and \\nAllah will love you, and will forgive you your \\nsins.” Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.\\n32. Say, “Obey Allah and the Messenger.” But \\nif they turn away—Allah does not love the \\nfaithless.\\n33. Allah chose Adam, and Noah, and the fam\\ufffeily of Abraham, and the family of Imran, over \\nall mankind.\\n34. Offspring one of the other. Allah is Hearer \\nand Knower.\\n35. The wife of Imran said, “My Lord, I have \\nvowed to You what is in my womb, dedi\\ufffecated, so accept from me; You are the Hearer \\nand Knower.”\\n36. And when she delivered her, she said, “My \\nLord, I have delivered a female,” and Allah \\nwas well aware of what she has delivered, \\n“and the male is not like the female, and I \\nhave named her Mary, and have commended \\nher and her descendants to Your protection, \\nfrom Satan the outcast.”\\n37. Her Lord accepted her with a gracious re\\ufffeception, and brought her a beautiful upbring\\ufffeing, and entrusted her to the care of Zecha\\uffferiah. Whenever Zechariah entered upon her \\nin the sanctuary, he found her with provision. \\nHe said, “O Mary, where did you get this \\nfrom?” She said, “It is from Allah; Allah pro\\ufffevides to whom He wills without reckoning.”\\n38. Thereupon Zechariah prayed to his Lord; \\nhe said, “My Lord, bestow on me good off\\ufffespring from Your presence; You are the \\nHearer of Prayers.” \\n39. Then the angels called out to him, as he \\nstood praying in the sanctuary: “Allah gives \\nyou good news of John; confirming a Word \\nfrom Allah, and honorable, and moral, and a \\nprophet; one of the upright.”\\n40. He said, “My Lord, how will I have a son, \\nwhen old age has overtaken me, and my wife \\nis barren?” He said, “Even so, Allah does \\nwhatever He wills.” \\n41. He said, “My Lord, give me a sign.” He said, \\n“Your sign is that you shall not speak to the \\npeople for three days, except by gestures. And \\nremember your Lord much, and praise in the \\nevening and the morning.”\\n42. The angels said, “O Mary, Allah has chosen \\nyou, and has purified you. He has chosen you \\nover all the women of the world. \\n43. “O Mary, be devoted to your Lord, and \\nbow down, and kneel with those who kneel.”\\n44. These are accounts from the Unseen, \\nwhich We reveal to you. You were not with \\nthem when they cast their lots as to which of \\nthem would take charge of Mary; nor were \\nyou with them as they quarreled.\\n45. The Angels said, “O Mary, Allah gives you \\ngood news of a Word from Him. His name is \\nthe Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, well-es\\ufffeteemed in this world and the next, and one of \\nthe nearest.\\n46. He will speak to the people from the crib, \\nand in adulthood, and will be one of the \\nrighteous.”\\n47. She said, “My Lord, how can I have a child, \\nwhen no man has touched me?” He said, “It \\nwill be so. Allah creates whatever He wills. To \\nhave anything done, He only says to it, ‘Be,’ \\nand it is.”\\n48. And He will teach him the Scripture and \\nwisdom, and the Torah and the Gospel.\\n49. A messenger to the Children of Israel: “I \\nhave come to you with a sign from your Lord. \\nI make for you out of clay the figure of a bird; \\nthen I breathe into it, and it becomes a bird \\nby Allah’s leave. And I heal the blind and the \\nleprous, and I revive the dead, by Allah’s \\nleave. And I inform you concerning what you \\n19\\n3. FAMILY OF IMRAN (Ali ‘Imran)\\neat, and what you store in your homes. In that \\nis a sign for you, if you are believers.”\\n50. “And verifying what lies before me of the \\nTorah, and to make lawful for you some of \\nwhat was forbidden to you. I have come to \\nyou with a sign from your Lord; so fear Allah, \\nand obey me.”\\n51. “Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so wor\\ufffeship Him. That is a straight path.”\\n52. When Jesus sensed disbelief on their part, \\nhe said, “Who are my allies towards Allah?” \\nThe disciples said, “We are Allah’s allies; we \\nhave believed in Allah, and bear witness that \\nwe submit.”\\n53. “Our Lord, we have believed in what You \\nhave revealed, and we have followed the Mes\\ufffesenger, so count us among the witnesses.”\\n54. They planned, and Allah planned; but Al\\ufffelah is the Best of planners. \\n55. Allah said, “O Jesus, I am terminating your\\nlife, and raising you to Me, and clearing you \\nof those who disbelieve. And I will make \\nthose who follow you superior to those who \\ndisbelieve, until the Day of Resurrection. \\nThen to Me is your return; then I will judge \\nbetween you regarding what you were dis\\ufffeputing.\\n56. As for those who disbelieve, I will punish \\nthem with a severe punishment, in this world \\nand the next, and they will have no helpers.\\n57. And as for those who believe and do good \\nworks, He will give them their rewards in full. \\nAllah does not love the unjust.”\\n58. This is what We recite to you of the Verses \\nand the Wise Reminder.\\n59. The likeness of Jesus in Allah’s sight is that \\nof Adam: He created him from dust, then \\nsaid to him, “Be,” and he was.\\n60. The truth is from your Lord, so do not be \\nof those who doubt.\\n61. And if anyone disputes with you about \\nhim, after the knowledge that has come to \\nyou, say, “Come, let us call our children and \\nyour children, and our women and your \\nwomen, and ourselves and yourselves, and let \\nus invoke Allah’s curse on the liars.”\\n62. This is the narrative of truth: there is no \\ngod but Allah. Allah is the Mighty, the Wise.\\n63. But if they turn away—Allah knows the \\ncorrupt.\\n64. Say, “O People of the Book, come to terms \\ncommon between us and you: that we wor\\ufffeship none but Allah, and that we associate \\nnothing with Him, and that none of us takes \\nothers as lords besides Allah.” And if they \\nturn away, say, “Bear witness that we have \\nsubmitted.” \\n65. O People of the Book! Why do you argue \\nabout Abraham, when the Torah and the\\nGospel were not revealed until after him? \\nWill you not reason?\\n66. Here you are—you argue about things you \\nknow, but why do you argue about things you \\ndo not know? Allah knows, and you do not \\nknow. \\n67. Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Chris\\ufffetian, but he was a Monotheist, a Muslim. And \\nhe was not of the Polytheists.\\n68. The people most deserving of Abraham are \\nthose who followed him, and this prophet, \\nand those who believe. Allah is the Guardian \\nof the believers.\\n69. A party of the People of the Book would \\nlove to lead you astray, but they only lead \\nthemselves astray, and they do not realize it.\\n70. O People of the Book! Why do you reject \\nthe revelations of Allah, even as you witness?\\n71. O People of the Book! Why do you con\\ufffefound the truth with falsehood, and know\\ufffeingly conceal the truth?\\n72. Some of the People of the Book say, “Be\\ufffelieve in what was revealed to the believers at \\nthe beginning of the day, and reject it at its \\nend, so that they may return.”\\n73. And trust none except those who follow \\nyour religion.” Say, “Guidance is Allah’s \\nguidance. If someone is given the like of what \\nyou were given, or they argue with you before \\nyour Lord, say, “All grace is in Allah’s hand; \\n20\\n3. FAMILY OF IMRAN (Ali ‘Imran)\\nHe gives it to whomever He wills.” Allah is \\nBounteous and Knowing.\\n74. He specifies His mercy for whomever He \\nwills. Allah is Possessor of Sublime Grace.\\n75. Among the People of the Book is he, who, \\nif you entrust him with a heap of gold, he will \\ngive it back to you. And among them is he, \\nwho, if you entrust him with a single coin, he \\nwill not give it back to you, unless you keep \\nafter him. That is because they say, “We are \\nunder no obligation towards the gentiles.” \\nThey tell lies about Allah, and they know it.\\n76. Indeed, whoever fulfills his commitments \\nand maintains piety—Allah loves the pious.\\n77. Those who exchange the covenant of Allah, \\nand their vows, for a small price, will have no \\nshare in the Hereafter, and Allah will not \\nspeak to them, nor will He look at them on \\nthe Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify \\nthem. They will have a painful punishment.\\n78. And among them are those who twist the \\nScripture with their tongues, that you may \\nthink it from the Scripture, when it is not \\nfrom the Scripture. And they say, “It is from \\nAllah,” when it is not from Allah. They tell \\nlies and attribute them to Allah, knowingly.\\n79. No person to whom Allah has given the \\nScripture, and wisdom, and prophethood \\nwould ever say to the people, “Be my wor\\ufffeshipers rather than Allah’s.” Rather, “Be peo\\ufffeple of the Lord, according to the Scripture \\nyou teach, and the teachings you learn.”\\n80. Nor would he command you to take the \\nangels and the prophets as lords. Would he \\ncommand you to infidelity after you have \\nsubmitted?\\n81. Allah received the covenant of the proph\\ufffeets, “Inasmuch as I have given you of scrip\\ufffeture and wisdom; should a messenger come \\nto you verifying what you have, you shall be\\ufffelieve in him, and support him.” He said, “Do \\nyou affirm My covenant and take it upon \\nyourselves?” They said, “We affirm it.” He \\nsaid, “Then bear witness, and I am with you \\namong the witnesses.”\\n82. Whoever turns away after that—these are \\nthe deceitful.\\n83. Do they desire other than the religion of \\nAllah, when to Him has submitted everything \\nin the heavens and the earth, willingly or un\\ufffewillingly, and to Him they will be returned?\\n84. Say, “We believe in Allah, and in what was \\nrevealed to us; and in what was revealed to \\nAbraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, \\nand the Patriarchs; and in what was given to \\nMoses, and Jesus, and the prophets from \\ntheir Lord. We make no distinction between \\nany of them, and to Him we submit.”\\n85. Whoever seeks other than Islam as a reli\\ufffegion, it will not be accepted from him, and in \\nthe Hereafter he will be among the losers.\\n86. How will Allah guide a people who disbe\\ufffelieved after having believed, and had wit\\ufffenessed that the Messenger is true, and the \\nclear proofs had come to them? Allah does \\nnot guide the unjust people.\\n87. Those—their penalty is that upon them \\nfalls the curse of Allah, and of the angels, and \\nof all mankind.\\n88. Remaining in it eternally, without their \\npunishment being eased from them, and \\nwithout being reprieved.\\n89. Except those who repent afterwards, and \\nreform; for Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.\\n90. As for those who disbelieve after having \\nbelieved, then plunge deeper into disbelief, \\ntheir repentance will not be accepted; these \\nare the lost.\\n91. As for those who disbelieve and die disbe\\ufffelievers, even the earth full of gold would not \\nbe accepted from any of them, were he to of\\ufffefer it for ransom. These will have a painful \\ntorment, and will have no saviors.\\n92. You will not attain virtuous conduct until \\nyou give of what you cherish. Whatever you \\ngive away, Allah is aware of it. \\n93. All food was permissible to the Children of \\nIsrael, except what Israel forbade for itself be\\ufffefore the Torah was revealed. Say, “Bring the \\nTorah, and read it, if you are truthful.”\\n21\\n3. FAMILY OF IMRAN (Ali ‘Imran)\\n94. Whoever forges lies about Allah after \\nthat—these are the unjust. \\n95. Say, “Allah has spoken the truth, so follow \\nthe religion of Abraham the Monotheist; he \\nwas not a Pagan.”\\n96. The first house established for mankind is \\nthe one at Bekka; blessed, and guidance for all \\npeople.\\n97. In it are evident signs; the Station of Abra\\ufffeham. Whoever enters it attains security. Pil\\ufffegrimage to the House is a duty to Allah for all \\nwho can make the journey. But as for those \\nwho refuse—Allah is Independent of the \\nworlds.\\n98. Say, “O People of the Scripture, why do you \\nreject the Revelations of Allah, when Allah \\nwitnesses what you do?”\\n99. Say, “O People of the Scripture, why do you \\nhinder from Allah’s path those who believe, \\nseeking to distort it, even though you are wit\\ufffenesses? Allah is not unaware of what you do.”\\n100. O you who believe! If you obey a party of \\nthose who were given the Scripture, they will \\nturn you, after your belief, into disbelievers.\\n101. And how could you disbelieve, when Al\\ufffelah’s revelations are being recited to you, and \\namong you is His Messenger? Whoever \\ncleaves to Allah has been guided to a straight \\npath.\\n102. O you who believe! Revere Allah with due \\nreverence, and do not die except as Muslims.\\n103. And hold fast to the rope of Allah, alto\\ufffegether, and do not become divided. And re\\ufffemember Allah’s blessings upon you; how you \\nwere enemies, and He reconciled your hearts, \\nand by His grace you became brethren. And \\nyou were on the brink of a pit of fire, and He \\nsaved you from it. Allah thus clarifies His rev\\ufffeelations for you, so that you may be guided.\\n104. And let there be among you a community \\ncalling to virtue, and advocating righteous\\ufffeness, and deterring from evil. These are the \\nsuccessful.\\n105. And do not be like those who separated \\nand disputed after the clear proofs came to \\nthem; for them is a great punishment.\\n106. On the Day when some faces will be whit\\ufffeened, and some faces will be blackened. As \\nfor those whose faces are blackened: “Did you\\ndisbelieve after your belief?” Then taste the \\npunishment for having disbelieved.\\n107. But as for those whose faces are whitened: \\nthey are in Allah’s mercy, remaining in it for\\ufffeever.\\n108. These are the revelations of Allah. We re\\ufffecite them to you in truth. Allah desires no in\\ufffejustice for mankind.\\n109. To Allah belongs everything in the heav\\ufffeens and everything on earth, and to Allah all \\nevents are referred.\\n110. You are the best community that ever \\nemerged for humanity: you advocate what is \\nmoral, and forbid what is immoral, and be\\ufffelieve in Allah. Had the People of the Scripture \\nbelieved, it would have been better for them. \\nAmong them are the believers, but most of \\nthem are sinners.\\n111. They will do you no harm, beyond insult\\ufffeing you. And if they fight you, they will turn \\naround and flee, then they will not be helped.\\n112. They shall be humiliated wherever they \\nare encountered, except through a rope from \\nAllah, and a rope from the people; and they \\nincurred wrath from Allah, and were stricken \\nwith misery. That is because they rejected Al\\ufffelah’s revelations, and killed the prophets un\\ufffejustly. That is because they rebelled and com\\ufffemitted aggression.\\n113. They are not alike. Among the People of \\nthe Scripture is a community that is upright; \\nthey recite Allah’s revelations throughout the \\nnight, and they prostrate themselves.\\n114. They believe in Allah and the Last Day, \\nand advocate righteousness and forbid evil, \\nand are quick to do good deeds. These are \\namong the righteous.\\n115. Whatever good they do, they will not be \\ndenied it. Allah knows the righteous.\\n22\\n3. FAMILY OF IMRAN (Ali ‘Imran)\\n116. As for those who disbelieve, neither their \\npossessions nor their children will avail them \\nanything against Allah. These are the inhab\\ufffeitants of the Fire, abiding therein forever.\\n117. The parable of what they spend in this\\nworldly life is that of a frosty wind that strikes \\nthe harvest of a people who have wronged \\ntheir souls, and destroys it. Allah did not \\nwrong them, but they wronged their own \\nselves.\\n118. O you who believe! Do not befriend out\\ufffesiders who never cease to wish you harm. \\nThey love to see you suffer. Hatred has al\\ufffeready appeared from their mouths, but what \\ntheir hearts conceal is worse. We have made \\nthe messages clear for you, if you understand.\\n119. There you are, you love them, but they do \\nnot love you, and you believe in the entire \\nscripture. And when they meet you, they say, \\n“We believe;” but when they are alone, they \\nbite their fingers in rage at you. Say, “Die in \\nyour rage; Allah knows what is within the \\nhearts.”\\n120. If something good happens to you, it up\\ufffesets them; but if something bad befalls you, \\nthey rejoice at it. But if you persevere and \\nmaintain righteousness, their schemes will \\nnot harm you at all. Allah comprehends what \\nthey do.\\n121. Remember when you left your home in the \\nmorning, to assign battle-positions for the \\nbelievers. Allah is Hearing and Knowing.\\n122. When two groups among you almost fal\\ufffetered, but Allah was their Protector. So in Al\\ufffelah let the believers put their trust.\\n123. Allah had given you victory at Badr, when \\nyou were weak. So fear Allah, that you may be \\nthankful.\\n124. When you said to the believers, “Is it not \\nenough for you that your Lord has reinforced \\nyou with three thousand angels, sent down?”\\n125. It is; but if you persevere and remain cau\\ufffetious, and they attack you suddenly, your \\nLord will reinforce you with five thousand \\nangels, well trained.\\n126. Allah made it but a message of hope for \\nyou, and to reassure your hearts thereby. Vic\\ufffetory comes only from Allah the Almighty, the \\nWise.\\n127. He thus cuts off a section of those who dis\\ufffebelieved, or subdues them, so they retreat dis\\ufffeappointed. \\n128. It is no concern of yours whether He re\\ufffedeems them or punishes them. They are \\nwrongdoers.\\n129. To Allah belongs everything in the heav\\ufffeens and the earth. He forgives whom He wills, \\nand He punishes whom He wills. Allah is \\nMost Forgiving, Most Merciful.\\n130. O you who believe! Do not feed on usury, \\ncompounded over and over, and fear Allah, \\nso that you may prosper.\\n131. And guard yourselves against the Fire that \\nis prepared for the disbelievers.\\n132. And obey Allah and the Messenger, that \\nyou may obtain mercy.\\n133. And race towards forgiveness from your \\nLord, and a Garden as wide as the heavens \\nand the earth, prepared for the righteous. \\n134. Those who give in prosperity and adver\\ufffesity, and those who restrain anger, and those \\nwho forgive people. Allah loves the doers of \\ngood.\\n135. And those who, when they commit an in\\ufffedecency or wrong themselves, remember Al\\ufffelah and ask forgiveness for their sins—and \\nwho forgives sins except Allah? And they do \\nnot persist in their wrongdoing while they \\nknow.\\n136. Those—their reward is forgiveness from \\ntheir Lord, and gardens beneath which rivers \\nflow, abiding therein forever. How excellent \\nis the reward of the workers. \\n137. Many societies have passed away before \\nyou. So travel the earth and note the fate of \\nthe deniers.\\n138. This is a proclamation to humanity, and \\nguidance, and advice for the righteous.\\n23\\n3. FAMILY OF IMRAN (Ali ‘Imran)\\n139. And do not waver, nor feel remorse. You \\nare the superior ones, if you are believers. \\n140. If a wound afflicts you, a similar wound \\nhas afflicted the others. Such days We alter\\ufffenate between the people, that Allah may \\nknow those who believe, and take martyrs \\nfrom among you. Allah does not love the evil\\ufffedoers.\\n141. So that Allah may prove those who believe, \\nand eliminate the disbelievers. \\n142. Or do you expect to enter Paradise, before \\nAllah has distinguished those among you \\nwho strive, and before He has distinguished \\nthe steadfast? \\n143. You used to wish for death before you \\nhave faced it. Now you have seen it before \\nyour own eyes.\\n144. Muhammad is no more than a messenger. \\nMessengers have passed on before him. If he \\ndies or gets killed, will you turn on your \\nheels? He who turns on his heels will not \\nharm Allah in any way. And Allah will re\\ufffeward the appreciative.\\n145. No soul can die except by Allah’s leave, at \\na predetermined time. Whoever desires the \\nreward of the world, We will give him some \\nof it; and whoever desires the reward of the \\nHereafter, We will give him some of it; and \\nWe will reward the appreciative.\\n146. How many a prophet fought alongside \\nhim numerous godly people? They did not \\nwaver for what afflicted them in the cause of \\nAllah, nor did they weaken, nor did they give \\nin. Allah loves those who endure.\\n147. Their only words were, “Our Lord, forgive \\nus our offences, and our excesses in our con\\ufffeduct, and strengthen our foothold, and help \\nus against the disbelieving people.”\\n148. So Allah gave them the reward of this \\nworld, and the excellent reward of the Here\\ufffeafter. Allah loves the doers of good.\\n149. O you who believe! If you obey those who \\ndisbelieve, they will turn you back on your \\nheels, and you end up losers.\\n150. Allah is your Master, and He is the Best of \\nHelpers.\\n151. We will throw terror into the hearts of \\nthose who disbelieve, because they attribute \\nto Allah partners for which He revealed no \\nsanction. Their lodging is the Fire. Miserable \\nis the lodging of the evildoers.\\n152. Allah has fulfilled His promise to you, and \\nyou defeated them by His leave; until when \\nyou faltered, and disputed the command, and \\ndisobeyed after He had shown you what you \\nlike. Some of you want this world, and some \\nof you want the next. Then He turned you \\naway from them, to test you; but He par\\ufffedoned you. Allah is Gracious towards the be\\ufffelievers.\\n153. Remember when you fled, not caring for \\nanyone, even though the Messenger was call\\ufffeing you from your rear. Then He repaid you \\nwith sorrow upon sorrow, so that you would \\nnot grieve over what you missed, or for what \\nafflicted you. Allah is Informed of what you \\ndo.\\n154. Then after the setback, He sent down se\\ufffecurity upon you. Slumber overcame some of \\nyou, while others cared only for themselves, \\nthinking of Allah thoughts that were un\\ufffetrue—thoughts of ignorance—saying, “Is an\\ufffeything up to us?” Say, “Everything is up to Al\\ufffelah.” They conceal within themselves what \\nthey do not reveal to you. And they say, “If it \\nwas up to us, none of us would have been \\nkilled here.” Say, “Even if you Had stayed in \\nyour homes, those destined to be killed would \\nhave marched into their death beds.” Allah \\nthus tests what is in your minds, and purifies \\nwhat is in your hearts. Allah knows what the \\nhearts contain.\\n155. Those of you who turned back on the day \\nwhen the two armies clashed—it was Satan \\nwho caused them to backslide, on account of \\nsome of what they have earned. But Allah has \\nforgiven them. Allah is Forgiving and Pru\\ufffedent.\\n156. O you who believe! Do not be like those \\nwho disbelieved, and said of their brethren \\n24\\n3. FAMILY OF IMRAN (Ali ‘Imran)\\nwho marched in the land, or went on the of\\ufffefensive, “Had they stayed with us, they would \\nnot have died or been killed.” So that Allah \\nmay make it a cause of regret in their hearts. \\nAllah gives life and causes death. Allah is See\\ufffeing of what you do.\\n157. If you are killed in the cause of Allah, or \\ndie—forgiveness and mercy from Allah are \\nbetter than what they hoard.\\n158. If you die, or are killed—to Allah you will \\nbe gathered up.\\n159. It is by of grace from Allah that you were \\ngentle with them. Had you been harsh, hard\\ufffehearted, they would have dispersed from \\naround you. So pardon them, and ask for\\ufffegiveness for them, and consult them in the \\nconduct of affairs. And when you make a de\\ufffecision, put your trust in Allah; Allah loves the \\ntrusting.\\n160. If Allah supports you, there is none who \\ncan overcome you. But if He fails you, who is \\nthere to help you after Him? So in Allah let\\nthe believers put their trust.\\n161. It is not for a prophet to act dishonestly. \\nWhoever acts dishonestly will bring his dis\\ufffehonesty on the Day of Resurrection. Then \\nevery soul will be paid in full for what it has \\nearned, and they will not be wronged.\\n162. Is someone who pursues Allah's approval \\nthe same as someone who incurs Allah's \\nwrath and his refuge is Hell—the miserable \\ndestination?\\n163. They have different ranks with Allah, and \\nAllah is Seeing of what they do.\\n164. Allah has blessed the believers, as He \\nraised up among them a messenger from \\namong themselves, who recites to them His \\nrevelations, and purifies them, and teaches \\nthem the Scripture and wisdom; although be\\ufffefore that they were in evident error.\\n165. And when a calamity befell you, even after \\nyou had inflicted twice as much, you said, \\n“How is this?” Say, “It is from your own \\nselves.” Allah is Able to do all things.\\n166. What befell you on the day the two armies \\nclashed was with Allah’s permission; that He \\nmay know the believers.\\n167. And that He may know the hypocrites. \\nAnd it was said to them, “Come, fight in the \\ncause of Allah, or contribute.” They said, “If \\nwe knew how to fight, we would have fol\\ufffelowed you.” On that day they were closer to \\ninfidelity than they were to faith. They say \\nwith their mouths what is not in their hearts; \\nbut Allah knows what they hide.\\n168. Those who said of their brethren, as they \\nstayed behind, “Had they obeyed us, they \\nwould not have been killed.” Say, “Then avert \\ndeath from yourselves, if you are truthful.”\\n169. Do not consider those killed in the cause \\nof Allah as dead. In fact, they are alive, at their \\nLord, well provided for.\\n170. Delighting in what Allah has given them \\nout of His grace, and happy for those who \\nhave not yet joined them; that they have \\nnothing to fear, nor will they grieve.\\n171. They rejoice in grace from Allah, and \\nbounty, and that Allah will not waste the re\\ufffeward of the faithful.\\n172. Those who responded to Allah and the \\nMessenger, despite the persecution they had \\nsuffered. For the virtuous and the pious \\namong them is a great reward.\\n173. Those to whom the people have said, “The \\npeople have mobilized against you, so fear \\nthem.” But this only increased them in faith, \\nand they said, “Allah is enough for us; He is \\nthe Excellent Protector.”\\n174. So they came back with grace from Allah, \\nand bounty, and no harm having touched \\nthem. They pursued what pleases Allah. Al\\ufffelah possesses immense grace.\\n175. That is only Satan frightening his parti\\ufffesans; so do not fear them, but fear Me, if you \\nare believers.\\n176. And do not be saddened by those who \\nrush into disbelief. They will not harm Allah \\nin the least. Allah desires to give them no \\n25\\n3. FAMILY OF IMRAN (Ali ‘Imran)\\nshare in the Hereafter. A terrible torment \\nawaits them.\\n177. Those who exchange blasphemy for faith \\nwill not harm Allah in the least. A painful tor\\ufffement awaits them.\\n178. Those who disbelieve should not assume \\nthat We respite them for their own good. In \\nfact, We only respite them so that they may \\nincrease in sinfulness. A humiliating torment \\nawaits them.\\n179. Allah will not leave the believers as you \\nare, without distinguishing the wicked from \\nthe sincere. Nor will Allah inform you of the \\nfuture, but Allah elects from among His mes\\ufffesengers whom He wills. So believe in Allah \\nand His messengers. If you believe and prac\\ufffetice piety, you will have a splendid reward.\\n180. Those who withhold what Allah has given \\nthem of his bounty should not assume that is \\ngood for them. In fact, it is bad for them. \\nThey will be encircled by their hoardings on \\nthe Day of Resurrection. To Allah belongs the \\ninheritance of the heavens and the earth, and \\nAllah is well acquainted with what you do.\\n181. Allah has heard the statement of those \\nwho said, “Allah is poor, and we are rich.” We \\nwill write down what they said, and their \\nwrongful killing of the prophets; and We will \\nsay, “Taste the torment of the burning.”\\n182. “This is on account of what your hands \\nhave forwarded, and because Allah is not un\\ufffejust towards the creatures.”\\n183. Those who said, “Allah has made a cove\\ufffenant with us, that we shall not believe in any \\nmessenger unless he brings us an offering to \\nbe consumed by fire.” Say, “Messengers have \\ncome to you before me with proofs, and with \\nwhat you asked for; so why did you assassi\\ufffenate them, if you are truthful?”\\n184. If they accuse you of lying, messengers be\\ufffefore you were accused of lying. They came \\nwith the proofs, and the Psalms, and the Illu\\ufffeminating Scripture.\\n185. Every soul will have a taste of death, and \\nyou will receive your recompense on the Day \\nof Resurrection. Whoever is swayed from the \\nFire, and admitted to Paradise, has won. The \\nlife of this world is merely enjoyment of de\\ufffelusion.\\n186. You will be tested through your posses\\ufffesions and your persons; and you will hear \\nfrom those who received the Scripture before \\nyou, and from the idol worshipers, much \\nabuse. But if you persevere and lead a right\\ufffeeous life—that indeed is a mark of great de\\ufffetermination. \\n187. Allah received a pledge from those who \\nwere given the Scripture: “You shall proclaim \\nit to the people, and not conceal it.” But they \\ndisregarded it behind their backs, and ex\\ufffechanged it for a small price. What a miserable \\nexchange they made.\\n188. Do not think that those who rejoice in \\nwhat they have done, and love to be praised \\nfor what they have not done—do not think \\nthey can evade the punishment. They will \\nhave a painful punishment.\\n189. To Allah belongs the sovereignty of the \\nheavens and the earth. Allah has power over \\nall things.\\n190. In the creation of the heavens and the \\nearth, and in the alternation of night and day, \\nare signs for people of understanding.\\n191. Those who remember Allah while stand\\ufffeing, and sitting, and on their sides; and they \\nreflect upon the creation of the heavens and \\nthe earth: “Our Lord, You did not create this \\nin vain, glory to You, so protect us from the \\npunishment of the Fire.”\\n192. “Our Lord, whomever You commit to the \\nFire, You have disgraced. The wrongdoers \\nwill have no helpers.”\\n193. “Our Lord, we have heard a caller calling \\nto the faith: `Believe in your Lord,' and we \\nhave believed. Our Lord! Forgive us our sins, \\nand remit our misdeeds, and make us die in \\nthe company of the virtuous.”\\n194. “Our Lord, and give us what You have \\npromised us through Your messengers, and \\ndo not disgrace us on the Day of Resurrec\\ufffetion. Surely You never break a promise.”\\n26\\n4. WOMEN (an-Nisa’)\\n195. And so their Lord answered them: “I will \\nnot waste the work of any worker among you, \\nwhether male or female. You are one of an\\ufffeother. For those who emigrated, and were ex\\ufffepelled from their homes, and were persecuted \\nbecause of Me, and fought and were killed—\\nI will remit for them their sins, and will admit \\nthem into gardens beneath which rivers \\nflow—a reward from Allah. With Allah is the \\nultimate reward.”\\n196. Do not be impressed by the disbelievers’ \\nmovements in the land.\\n197. A brief enjoyment, then their abode is \\nHell. What a miserable resort.\\n198. As for those who feared their Lord: for \\nthem will be gardens beneath which rivers \\nflow, wherein they will abide forever—hospi\\ufffetality from Allah. What Allah possesses is \\nbest for the just.\\n199. Among the People of the Scripture are \\nthose who believe in Allah, and in what was \\nrevealed to you, and in what was revealed to \\nthem. They are humble before Allah, and \\nthey do not sell Allah’s revelations for a cheap \\nprice. These will have their reward with their \\nLord. Allah is swift in reckoning.\\n200. O you who believe! Be patient, and advo\\ufffecate patience, and be united, and revere Al\\ufffelah, so that you may thrive.\\n4. WOMEN\\n(an-Nisa’)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. O people! Fear your Lord, who created you \\nfrom a single soul, and created from it its \\nmate, and propagated from them many men \\nand women. And revere Allah whom you ask \\nabout, and the parents. Surely, Allah is \\nWatchful over you.\\n2. And give orphans their properties, and do \\nnot substitute the bad for the good. And do \\nnot consume their properties by combining \\nthem with yours, for that would be a serious \\nsin.\\n3. If you fear you cannot act fairly towards the \\norphans—then marry the women you like—\\ntwo, or three, or four. But if you fear you will \\nnot be fair, then one, or what you already \\nhave. That makes it more likely that you \\navoid bias.\\n4. Give women their dowries graciously. But if \\nthey willingly forego some of it, then con\\ufffesume it with enjoyment and pleasure.\\n5. Do not give the immature your money \\nwhich Allah has assigned to you for support. \\nBut provide for them from it, and clothe \\nthem, and speak to them with kind words.\\n6. Test the orphans until they reach the age of \\nmarriage. If you find them to be mature \\nenough, hand over their properties to them. \\nAnd do not consume it extravagantly or hast\\ufffeily before they grow up. The rich shall not \\ncharge any wage, but the poor may charge \\nfairly. When you hand over their properties \\nto them, have it witnessed for them. Allah \\nsuffices as a Reckoner.\\n7. Men receive a share of what their parents \\nand relatives leave, and women receive a \\nshare of what their parents and relatives \\nleave; be it little or much—a legal share.\\n8. If the distribution is attended by the rela\\ufffetives, and the orphans, and the needy, give \\nthem something out of it, and speak to them \\nkindly.\\n9. Those who are concerned about the fate of \\ntheir weak children, in case they leave them \\nbehind, should fear Allah, and speak appro\\ufffepriate words.\\n10. Those who consume the wealth of orphans \\nillicitly consume only fire into their bellies; \\nand they will roast in a Blaze.\\n11. Allah instructs you regarding your chil\\ufffedren: The male receives the equivalent of the \\nshare of two females. If they are daughters, \\nmore than two, they get two-thirds of what he \\nleaves. If there is only one, she gets one-half. \\nAs for the parents, each gets one-sixth of \\nwhat he leaves, if he had children. If he had \\nno children, and his parents inherit from \\n27\\n4. WOMEN (an-Nisa’)\\nhim, his mother gets one-third. If he has sib\\ufffelings, his mother gets one-sixth. After ful\\ufffefilling any bequest and paying off debts. Your \\nparents and your children—you do not know \\nwhich are closer to you in welfare. This is Al\\ufffelah's Law. Allah is Knowing and Judicious.\\n12. You get one-half of what your wives leave \\nbehind, if they had no children. If they had \\nchildren, you get one-fourth of what they \\nleave. After fulfilling any bequest and paying \\noff debts. They get one-fourth of what you \\nleave behind, if you have no children. If you \\nhave children, they get one-eighth of what \\nyou leave. After fulfilling any bequest and \\npaying off debts. If a man or woman leaves \\nneither parents nor children, but has a \\nbrother or sister, each of them gets one-sixth. \\nIf there are more siblings, they share one\\ufffethird. After fulfilling any bequest and paying \\noff debts, without any prejudice. This is a will \\nfrom Allah. Allah is Knowing and Clement.\\n13. These are the bounds set by Allah. Who\\ufffeever obeys Allah and His Messenger, He will \\nadmit him into Gardens beneath which rivers \\nflow, to abide therein forever. That is the \\ngreat attainment.\\n14. But whoever disobeys Allah and His Mes\\ufffesenger, and oversteps His bounds, He will ad\\ufffemit him into a Fire, wherein he abides for\\ufffeever, and he will have a shameful punish\\ufffement.\\n15. Those of your women who commit lewd\\ufffeness, you must have four witnesses against \\nthem, from among you. If they testify, con\\ufffefine them to the homes until death claims \\nthem, or Allah makes a way for them.\\n16. If two men among you commit it, punish \\nthem both. But if they repent and reform, \\nleave them alone. Allah is Redeemer, Full of \\nMercy.\\n17. Repentance is available from Allah for \\nthose who commit evil out of ignorance, and \\nthen repent soon after. These—Allah will re\\ufffelent towards them. Allah is Knowing and \\nWise.\\n18. But repentance is not available for those \\nwho commit evils, until when death ap\\ufffeproaches one of them, he says, “Now I re\\ufffepent,” nor for those who die as disbelievers. \\nThese—We have prepared for them a painful \\ntorment.\\n19. O you who believe! It is not permitted for \\nyou to inherit women against their will. And \\ndo not coerce them in order to take away \\nsome of what you had given them, unless they \\ncommit a proven adultery. And live with \\nthem in kindness. If you dislike them, it may \\nbe that you dislike something in which Allah \\nhas placed much good.\\n20. If you wish to replace one wife with an\\ufffeother, and you have given one of them a for\\ufffetune, take nothing back from it. Would you \\ntake it back fraudulently and sinfully?\\n21. And how can you take it back, when you \\nhave been intimate with one another, and \\nthey have received from you a solid commit\\ufffement?\\n22. Do not marry women whom your fathers \\nmarried, except what is already past. That is \\nimproper, indecent, and a bad custom.\\n23. Forbidden for you are your mothers, your \\ndaughters, your sisters, your paternal aunts, \\nyour maternal aunts, your brother's daugh\\ufffeters, your sister's daughters, your foster\\ufffemothers who nursed you, your sisters \\nthrough nursing, your wives' mothers, and \\nyour stepdaughters in your guardianship—\\nborn of wives you have gone into—but if you \\nhave not gone into them, there is no blame on \\nyou. And the wives of your genetic sons, and \\nmarrying two sisters simultaneously. Except \\nwhat is past. Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most \\nMerciful.\\n24. And all married women, except those you \\nrightfully possess. This is Allah’s decree, \\nbinding upon you. Permitted for you are \\nthose that lie outside these limits, provided \\nyou seek them in legal marriage, with gifts \\nfrom your property, seeking wedlock, not \\nprostitution. If you wish to enjoy them, then \\ngive them their dowry—a legal obligation. \\nYou commit no error by agreeing to any \\n28\\n4. WOMEN (an-Nisa’)\\nchange to the dowry. Allah is All-Knowing, \\nMost Wise.\\n25. If any of you lack the means to marry free \\nbelieving women, he may marry one of the \\nbelieving maids under your control. Allah is \\nwell aware of your faith. You are from one \\nanother. Marry them with the permission of \\ntheir guardians, and give them their recom\\ufffepense fairly—to be protected—neither com\\ufffemitting adultery, nor taking secret lovers. \\nWhen they are married, if they commit adul\\ufffetery, their punishment shall be half that of \\nfree women. That is for those among you who \\nfear falling into decadence. But to practice \\nself-restraint is better for you. Allah is Most \\nForgiving, Most Merciful.\\n26. Allah intends to make things clear to you, \\nand to guide you in the ways of those before \\nyou, and to redeem you. Allah is Most Know\\ufffeing, Most Wise.\\n27. Allah intends to redeem you, but those \\nwho follow their desires want you to turn \\naway utterly.\\n28. Allah intends to lighten your burden, for \\nthe human being was created weak.\\n29. O you who believe! Do not consume each \\nother’s wealth illicitly, but trade by mutual \\nconsent. And do not kill yourselves, for Allah \\nis Merciful towards you.\\n30. Whoever does that, out of hostility and \\nwrongdoing, We will cast him into a Fire. \\nAnd that would be easy for Allah.\\n31. If you avoid the worst of what you are for\\ufffebidden, We will remit your sins, and admit \\nyou by a Gate of Honor.\\n32. Do not covet what Allah has given to some \\nof you in preference to others. For men is a \\nshare of what they have earned, and for \\nwomen is a share of what they have earned. \\nAnd ask Allah of his bounty. Allah has \\nknowledge of everything.\\n33. To everyone We have assigned beneficiar\\ufffeies in what is left by parents and relatives. \\nThose with whom you have made an agree\\ufffement, give them their share. Allah is Witness \\nover all things.\\n34. Men are the protectors and maintainers of \\nwomen, as Allah has given some of them an \\nadvantage over others, and because they \\nspend out of their wealth. The good women \\nare obedient, guarding what Allah would \\nhave them guard. As for those from whom \\nyou fear disloyalty, admonish them, and \\nabandon them in their beds, then strike them. \\nBut if they obey you, seek no way against \\nthem. Allah is Sublime, Great.\\n35. If you fear a breach between the two, ap\\ufffepoint an arbiter from his family and an arbi\\ufffeter from her family. If they wish to reconcile, \\nAllah will bring them together. Allah is \\nKnowledgeable, Expert.\\n36. Worship Allah, and ascribe no partners to \\nHim, and be good to the parents, and the rel\\ufffeatives, and the orphans, and the poor, and the \\nneighbor next door, and the distant neighbor, \\nand the close associate, and the traveler, and \\nyour servants. Allah does not love the arro\\ufffegant showoff.\\n37. Those who are stingy, and exhort people to \\nstinginess, and conceal what Allah has given \\nthem from His bounty. We have prepared for \\nthe disbelievers a disgraceful punishment.\\n38. And those who spend their money to be \\nseen by people, and believe neither in Allah \\nnor in the Last Day. Whoever has Satan as a \\ncompanion—what an evil companion.\\n39. What would they have lost, had they be\\ufffelieved in Allah and the Last Day, and gave out \\nof what Allah has provided for them? Allah \\nknows them very well.\\n40. Allah does not commit an atom's weight of \\ninjustice; and if there is a good deed, He dou\\ufffebles it, and gives from His Presence a sublime \\ncompensation.\\n41. Then how will it be, when We bring a wit\\ufffeness from every community, and We bring \\nyou as a witness against these?\\n42. On that Day, those who disbelieved and \\ndisobeyed the Messenger will wish that the \\nearth were leveled over them. They will con\\ufffeceal nothing from Allah.\\n29\\n4. WOMEN (an-Nisa’)\\n43. O you who believe! Do not approach the \\nprayer while you are drunk, so that you know \\nwhat you say; nor after sexual orgasm—un\\ufffeless you are travelling—until you have \\nbathed. If you are sick, or traveling, or one of \\nyou comes from the toilet, or you have had \\nintercourse with women, and cannot find \\nwater, find clean sand and wipe your faces \\nand your hands with it. Allah is Pardoning \\nand Forgiving.\\n44. Have you not considered those who were \\ngiven a share of the Book? They buy error, \\nand wish you would lose the way.\\n45. But Allah knows your enemies best. Allah \\nis sufficient as a Protector, and Allah is suffi\\ufffecient as a Supporter.\\n46. Among the Jews are some who take words \\nout of context, and say, “We hear and we dis\\ufffeobey”, and “Hear without listening”, and \\n“Observe us,” twisting with their tongues and \\nslandering the religion. Had they said, “We \\nhear and we obey”, and “Listen”, and “Give \\nus your attention,” it would have been better \\nfor them, and more upright. But Allah has \\ncursed them for their disbelief; they do not \\nbelieve except a little.\\n47. O you who were given the Book! Believe in \\nwhat We sent down, confirming what you \\nhave, before We obliterate faces and turn \\nthem inside out, or curse them as We cursed \\nthe Sabbath-breakers. The command of Allah \\nis always done.\\n48. Allah does not forgive association with \\nHim, but He forgives anything less than that \\nto whomever He wills. Whoever associates \\nanything with Allah has devised a monstrous \\nsin.\\n49. Have you not considered those who claim \\npurity for themselves? Rather, Allah purifies \\nwhom He wills, and they will not be wronged \\na whit.\\n50. See how they devise lies against Allah. That \\nalone is an outright sin.\\n51. Have you not considered those who were \\ngiven a share of the Book? They believe in su\\ufffeperstition and evil powers, and say of those \\nwho disbelieve, “These are better guided on \\nthe way than the believers.”\\n52. Those are they whom Allah has cursed. \\nWhomever Allah curses, you will find no sav\\ufffeior for him.\\n53. Or do they own a share of the kingdom? \\nThen they would not give people a speck.\\n54. Or do they envy the people for what Allah \\nhas given them of His grace? We have given \\nthe family of Abraham the Book and wisdom, \\nand We have given them a great kingdom.\\n55. Among them are those who believed in it, \\nand among them are those who held back \\nfrom it. Hell is a sufficient Inferno.\\n56. Those who reject Our revelations—We will \\nscorch them in a Fire. Every time their skins \\nare cooked, We will replace them with other \\nskins, so they will experience the suffering. \\nAllah is Most Powerful, Most Wise.\\n57. As for those who believe and do good \\ndeeds, We will admit them into Gardens be\\ufffeneath which rivers flow, abiding therein for\\ufffeever. They will have purified spouses therein, \\nand We will admit them into a shady shade.\\n58. Allah instructs you to give back things en\\ufffetrusted to you to their owners. And when you \\njudge between people, judge with justice. Al\\ufffelah’s instructions to you are excellent. Allah \\nis All-Hearing, All-Seeing.\\n59. O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey \\nthe Messenger and those in authority among \\nyou. And if you dispute over anything, refer \\nit to Allah and the Messenger, if you believe \\nin Allah and the Last Day. That is best, and a \\nmost excellent determination.\\n60. Have you not observed those who claim \\nthat they believe in what was revealed to you, \\nand in what was revealed before you, yet they \\nseek Satanic sources for legislation, in spite of \\nbeing commanded to reject them? Satan \\nmeans to mislead them far away.\\n61. And when it is said to them, “Come to what \\nAllah has revealed, and to the Messenger,” \\nyou see the hypocrites shunning you com\\ufffepletely.\\n30\\n4. WOMEN (an-Nisa’)\\n62. How about when a disaster strikes them \\nbecause what their hands have put forward, \\nand then they come to you swearing by Allah: \\n“We only intended goodwill and reconcilia\\ufffetion”?\\n63. They are those whom Allah knows what is \\nin their hearts. So ignore them, and admon\\ufffeish them, and say to them concerning them\\ufffeselves penetrating words.\\n64. We did not send any messenger except to \\nbe obeyed by Allah’s leave. Had they, when \\nthey wronged themselves, come to you, and \\nprayed for Allah's forgiveness, and the Mes\\ufffesenger had prayed for their forgiveness, they \\nwould have found Allah Relenting and Mer\\ufffeciful.\\n65. But no, by your Lord, they will not believe \\nuntil they call you to arbitrate in their dis\\ufffeputes, and then find within themselves no re\\ufffesentment regarding your decisions, and sub\\ufffemit themselves completely.\\n66. Had We decreed for them: “Kill your\\ufffeselves,” or “Leave your homes,” they would \\nnot have done it, except for a few of them. But \\nhad they done what they were instructed to \\ndo, it would have been better for them, and a \\nfirmer confirmation.\\n67. And We would have given them from Our \\npresence a rich compensation.\\n68. And We would have guided them on a \\nstraight path.\\n69. Whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger—\\nthese are with those whom Allah has \\nblessed—among the prophets, and the sin\\ufffecere, and the martyrs, and the upright. Excel\\ufffelent are those as companions.\\n70. That is the grace from Allah. Allah suffices \\nas Knower.\\n71. O you who believe! Take your precautions, \\nand mobilize in groups, or mobilize alto\\ufffegether.\\n72. Among you is he who lags behind. Then, \\nwhen a calamity befalls you, he says, “Allah \\nhas favored me, that I was not martyred with \\nthem.”\\n73. But when some bounty from Allah comes \\nto you, he says—as if no affection existed be\\ufffetween you and him—“If only I had been with \\nthem, I would have achieved a great victory.”\\n74. Let those who sell the life of this world for \\nthe Hereafter fight in the cause of Allah. \\nWhoever fights in the cause of Allah, and \\nthen is killed, or achieves victory, We will \\ngrant him a great compensation.\\n75. And why would you not fight in the cause \\nof Allah, and the helpless men, and women, \\nand children, cry out, “Our Lord, deliver us \\nfrom this town whose people are oppressive, \\nand appoint for us from Your Presence a Pro\\ufffetector, and appoint for us from Your Pres\\ufffeence a Victor.”\\n76. Those who believe fight in the cause of Al\\ufffelah, while those who disbelieve fight in the \\ncause of Evil. So fight the allies of the Devil. \\nSurely the strategy of the Devil is weak.\\n77. Have you not considered those who were \\ntold, “Restrain your hands, and perform your \\nprayers, and spend in regular charity”? But \\nwhen fighting was ordained for them, a fac\\ufffetion of them feared the people as Allah is \\nought to be feared, or even more. And they \\nsaid, “Our Lord, why did You ordain fighting \\nfor us? If only You would postpone it for us \\nfor a short while.” Say, “The enjoyments of \\nthis life are brief, but the Hereafter is better \\nfor the righteous, and you will not be \\nwronged one bit.”\\n78. Wherever you may be, death will catch up \\nwith you, even if you were in fortified towers. \\nWhen a good fortune comes their way, they \\nsay, “This is from Allah.” But when a misfor\\ufffetune befalls them, they say, “This is from \\nyou.” Say, “All is from Allah.” So what is the \\nmatter with these people, that they hardly un\\ufffederstand a thing?\\n79. Whatever good happens to you is from Al\\ufffelah, and whatever bad happens to you is from \\nyour own self. We sent you to humanity as a \\nmessenger, and Allah is Witness enough.\\n80. Whoever obeys the Messenger is obeying \\nAllah. And whoever turns away—We did not \\nsend you as a watcher over them.\\n31\\n4. WOMEN (an-Nisa’)\\n81. They profess obedience, but when they \\nleave your presence, some of them conspire \\nsomething contrary to what you said. But Al\\ufffelah writes down what they conspire. So avoid \\nthem, and put your trust in Allah. Allah is \\nGuardian enough.\\n82. Do they not ponder the Quran? Had it \\nbeen from any other than Allah, they would \\nhave found in it much discrepancy.\\n83. When some news of security or alarm \\ncomes their way, they broadcast it. But had \\nthey referred it to the Messenger, and to those \\nin authority among them, those who can \\ndraw conclusions from it would have com\\ufffeprehended it. Were it not for Allah’s blessing \\nand mercy upon you, you would have fol\\ufffelowed the Devil, except for a few.\\n84. So fight in the cause of Allah; you are re\\ufffesponsible only for yourself. And rouse the be\\ufffelievers. Perhaps Allah will restrain the might \\nof those who disbelieve. Allah is Stronger in \\nMight, and More Punishing.\\n85. Whoever intercedes for a good cause has a \\nshare in it, and whoever intercedes for an evil \\ncause shares in its burdens. Allah keeps watch \\nover everything.\\n86. When you are greeted with a greeting, re\\ufffespond with a better greeting, or return it. Al\\ufffelah keeps count of everything.\\n87. Allah—there is no god except He. He will \\ngather you to the Day of Resurrection, in \\nwhich there is no doubt. And who speaks \\nmore truly than Allah?\\n88. What is the matter with you, divided into \\ntwo factions regarding the hypocrites, when \\nAllah Himself has overwhelmed them on ac\\ufffecount of what they did? Do you want to guide \\nthose whom Allah has led astray? Whomever \\nAllah leads astray—you will never find for \\nhim a way.\\n89. They would love to see you disbelieve, just \\nas they disbelieve, so you would become \\nequal. So do not befriend any of them, unless \\nthey emigrate in the way of Allah. If they turn \\naway, seize them and execute them wherever \\nyou may find them; and do not take from \\namong them allies or supporters.\\n90. Except those who join people with whom \\nyou have a treaty, or those who come to you \\nreluctant to fight you or fight their own peo\\ufffeple. Had Allah willed, He would have given \\nthem power over you, and they would have \\nfought you. If they withdraw from you, and \\ndo not fight you, and offer you peace, then \\nAllah assigns no excuse for you against them.\\n91. You will find others who want security \\nfrom you, and security from their own peo\\ufffeple. But whenever they are tempted into civil \\ndiscord, they plunge into it. So if they do not \\nwithdraw from you, nor offer you peace, nor \\nrestrain their hands, seize them and execute \\nthem wherever you find them. Against these, \\nWe have given you clear authorization.\\n92. Never should a believer kill another be\\ufffeliever, unless by error. Anyone who kills a be\\ufffeliever by error must set free a believing slave, \\nand pay compensation to the victim’s family, \\nunless they remit it as charity. If the victim \\nbelonged to a people who are hostile to you, \\nbut is a believer, then the compensation is to \\nfree a believing slave. If he belonged to a peo\\ufffeple with whom you have a treaty, then com\\ufffepensation should be handed over to his fam\\ufffeily, and a believing slave set free. Anyone who \\nlacks the means must fast for two consecutive \\nmonths, by way of repentance to Allah. Allah \\nis All-Knowing, Most Wise.\\n93. Whoever kills a believer deliberately, the \\npenalty for him is Hell, where he will remain \\nforever. And Allah will be angry with him, \\nand will curse him, and will prepare for him \\na terrible punishment. \\n94. O you who believe! When you journey in \\nthe way of Allah, investigate, and do not say \\nto him who offers you peace, “You are not a \\nbeliever,” aspiring for the goods of this world. \\nWith Allah are abundant riches. You your\\ufffeselves were like this before, and Allah be\\ufffestowed favor on you; so investigate. Allah is \\nwell aware of what you do.\\n32\\n4. WOMEN (an-Nisa’)\\n95. Not equal are the inactive among the be\\ufffelievers—except the disabled—and the striv\\ufffeers in the cause of Allah with their posses\\ufffesions and their persons. Allah prefers the \\nstrivers with their possessions and their per\\ufffesons above the inactive, by a degree. But Al\\ufffelah has promised goodness to both. Yet Allah \\nfavors the strivers, over the inactive, with a \\ngreat reward.\\n96. Degrees from Him, and forgiveness, and \\nmercy. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.\\n97. While the angels are removing the souls of \\nthose who have wronged themselves, they \\nwill say, “What was the matter with you?” \\nThey will say, “We were oppressed in the \\nland.” They will say, “Was Allah’s earth not \\nvast enough for you to emigrate in it?” \\nThese—their refuge is Hell. What a wretched \\nretreat!\\n98. Except for the weak among men, and \\nwomen, and children who have no means to \\nact, and no means to find a way out.\\n99. These—Allah may well pardon them. Allah \\nis Pardoning and Forgiving.\\n100. Anyone who emigrates for the sake of Al\\ufffelah will find on earth many places of refuge, \\nand plentitude. Anyone who leaves his home, \\nemigrating to Allah and His Messenger, and \\nthen is overtaken by death, his compensation \\nfalls on Allah. Allah is Forgiver, Most Merci\\ufffeful.\\n101. When you travel in the land, there is no \\nblame on you for shortening the prayers, if \\nyou fear that the disbelievers may harm you. \\nThe disbelievers are your manifest enemies.\\n102. When you are among them, and you stand \\nto lead them in prayer, let a group of them \\nstand with you, and let them hold their weap\\ufffeons. Then, when they have done their pros\\ufffetrations, let them withdraw to the rear, and \\nlet another group, that have not prayed yet, \\ncome forward and pray with you; and let \\nthem take their precautions and their weap\\ufffeons. Those who disbelieve would like you to \\nneglect your weapons and your equipment, \\nso they can attack you in a single assault. You \\ncommit no error, if you are hampered by rain \\nor are sick, by putting down your weapons; \\nbut take precautions. Indeed, Allah has pre\\ufffepared for the disbelievers a demeaning pun\\ufffeishment.\\n103. When you have completed the prayer, re\\ufffemember Allah, standing, or sitting, or on \\nyour sides. And when you feel secure, per\\ufffeform the prayer. The prayer is obligatory for \\nbelievers at specific times.\\n104. And do not falter in the pursuit of the en\\ufffeemy. If you are aching, they are aching as you \\nare aching, but you expect from Allah what \\nthey cannot expect. Allah is Knowledgeable \\nand Wise.\\n105. We have revealed to you the Scripture, \\nwith the truth, so that you judge between \\npeople in accordance with what Allah has \\nshown you. And do not be an advocate for the \\ntraitors.\\n106. And ask Allah for forgiveness. Allah is \\nForgiver and Merciful.\\n107. And do not argue on behalf of those who \\ndeceive themselves. Allah does not love the \\ndeceitful sinner.\\n108. They hide from the people, but they can\\ufffenot hide from Allah. He is with them, as they \\nplot by night with words He does not ap\\ufffeprove. Allah comprehends what they do.\\n109. There you are, arguing on their behalf in \\nthe present life, but who will argue with Allah \\non their behalf on the Day of Resurrection? \\nOr who will be their representative?\\n110. Whoever commits evil, or wrongs his soul, \\nthen implores Allah for forgiveness, will find \\nAllah Forgiving and Merciful.\\n111. And Whoever earns a sin, earns it against \\nhimself. Allah is Aware and Wise.\\n112. And whoever commits a mistake, or a sin, \\nand then blames it on an innocent person, \\nhas taken a slander and a clear sin.\\n113. Were it not for Allah’s grace towards you, \\nand His mercy, a faction of them would have \\nmanaged to mislead you. But they only mis\\ufffelead themselves, and they cannot harm you in \\n33\\n4. WOMEN (an-Nisa’)\\nany way. Allah has revealed to you the Scrip\\ufffeture and wisdom, and has taught you what \\nyou did not know. Allah’s goodness towards \\nyou is great.\\n114. There is no good in much of their private \\ncounsels, except for him who advocates char\\ufffeity, or kindness, or reconciliation between \\npeople. Whoever does that, seeking Allah’s \\napproval, We will give him a great compen\\ufffesation.\\n115. Whoever makes a breach with the Messen\\ufffeger, after the guidance has become clear to \\nhim, and follows other than the path of the \\nbelievers, We will direct him in the direction \\nhe has chosen, and commit him to Hell—\\nwhat a terrible destination!\\n116. Allah will not forgive that partners be as\\ufffesociated with Him; but will forgive anything \\nless than that, to whomever He wills. Anyone \\nwho ascribes partners to Allah has strayed \\ninto far error.\\n117. They invoke in His stead only females. In \\nfact, they invoke none but a rebellious devil.\\n118. Allah has cursed him. And he said, “I will \\ntake to myself my due share of Your serv\\ufffeants.”\\n119. “And I will mislead them, and I will entice \\nthem, and I will prompt them to slit the ears \\nof cattle, and I will prompt them to alter the \\ncreation of Allah.” Whoever takes Satan as a \\nlord, instead of Allah, has surely suffered a \\nprofound loss.\\n120. He promises them, and he raises their ex\\ufffepectations, but Satan promises them nothing \\nbut delusions.\\n121. These—their place is Hell, and they will \\nfind no escape from it.\\n122. But as for those who believe and do right\\ufffeeous deeds, We will admit them into gardens \\nbeneath which rivers flow, where they will \\nabide forever. The promise of Allah is true—\\nand who is more truthful in speech than Al\\ufffelah?\\n123. It is not in accordance with your wishes, \\nnor in accordance with the wishes of the Peo\\ufffeple of the Scripture. Whoever works evil will \\npay for it, and will not find for himself, be\\ufffesides Allah, any protector or savior.\\n124. But whoever works righteousness, \\nwhether male or female, and is a believer—\\nthose will enter Paradise, and will not be \\nwronged a whit.\\n125. And who is better in religion than he who \\nsubmits himself wholly to Allah, and is a doer \\nof good, and follows the faith of Abraham the \\nMonotheist? Allah has chosen Abraham for a \\nfriend.\\n126. To Allah belongs what is in the heavens \\nand what is on earth, and Allah encompasses \\neverything.\\n127. They ask you for a ruling about women. \\nSay, “Allah gives you a ruling about them, \\nand so does what is stated to you in the Book \\nabout widowed women from whom you \\nwithhold what is decreed for them, yet you \\ndesire to marry them, and about helpless chil\\ufffedren: that you should treat the orphans \\nfairly.” Whatever good you do, Allah knows \\nit.\\n128. If a woman fears maltreatment or deser\\ufffetion from her husband, there is no fault in \\nthem if they reconcile their differences, for \\nreconciliation is best. Souls are prone to ava\\uffferice; yet if you do what is good, and practice \\npiety—Allah is Cognizant of what you do.\\n129. You will not be able to treat women with \\nequal fairness, no matter how much you de\\ufffesire it. But do not be so biased as to leave an\\ufffeother suspended. If you make amends, and \\nact righteously—Allah is Forgiving and Mer\\ufffeciful.\\n130. And if they separate, Allah will enrich each \\nfrom His abundance. Allah is Bounteous and \\nWise.\\n131. To Allah belongs everything in the heav\\ufffeens and everything on earth. We have in\\ufffestructed those who were given the Book be\\ufffefore you, and you, to be conscious of Allah. \\n34\\n4. WOMEN (an-Nisa’)\\nBut if you refuse—to Allah belongs every\\ufffething in the heavens and everything on earth. \\nAllah is in no need, Praiseworthy.\\n132. To Allah belongs everything in the heav\\ufffeens and everything on earth. Allah suffices as \\nManager.\\n133. If He wills, He can do away with you, O \\npeople, and bring others. Allah is Able to do \\nthat.\\n134. Whoever desires the reward of this \\nworld—with Allah is the reward of this world \\nand the next. Allah is All-Hearing, All-See\\ufffeing.\\n135. O you who believe! Stand firmly for jus\\ufffetice, as witnesses to Allah, even if against \\nyourselves, or your parents, or your relatives. \\nWhether one is rich or poor, Allah takes care \\nof both. So do not follow your desires, lest \\nyou swerve. If you deviate, or turn away—\\nthen Allah is Aware of what you do.\\n136. O you who believe! Believe in Allah and \\nHis messenger, and the Book He sent down \\nto His messenger, and the Book He sent \\ndown before. Whoever rejects Allah, His an\\ufffegels, His Books, His messengers, and the Last \\nDay, has strayed far in error.\\n137. Those who believe, then disbelieve, then \\nbelieve, then disbelieve, then increase in dis\\ufffebelief, Allah will not forgive them, nor will He \\nguide them to a way.\\n138. Inform the hypocrites that they will have a \\npainful punishment.\\n139. Those who ally themselves with the disbe\\ufffelievers instead of the believers. Do they seek \\nglory in them? All glory belongs to Allah.\\n140. He has revealed to you in the Book that \\nwhen you hear Allah’s revelations being re\\ufffejected, or ridiculed, do not sit with them until \\nthey engage in some other subject. Other\\ufffewise, you would be like them. Allah will \\ngather the hypocrites and the disbelievers, \\ninto Hell, altogether.\\n141. Those who lie in wait for you: if you attain \\nvictory from Allah, they say, “Were we not \\nwith you?” But if the disbelievers get a turn, \\nthey say, “Did we not side with you, and de\\ufffefend you from the believers?” Allah will judge \\nbetween you on the Day of Resurrection; and \\nAllah will give the disbelievers no means of \\novercoming the believers.\\n142. The hypocrites try to deceive Allah, but He \\nis deceiving them. And when they stand for \\nprayer, they stand lazily, showing off in front \\nof people, and remembering Allah only a lit\\ufffetle.\\n143. Wavering in between, neither with these, \\nnor with those. Whomever Allah sends \\nastray, you will never find for him a way.\\n144. O you who believe! Do not befriend disbe\\ufffelievers rather than believers. Do you want to \\ngive Allah a clear case against you?\\n145. The hypocrites will be in the lowest level \\nof the Fire, and you will find no helper for \\nthem.\\n146. Except those who repent, and reform, and \\nhold fast to Allah, and dedicate their religion \\nto Allah alone. These are with the believers; \\nand Allah will give the believers a great re\\ufffeward.\\n147. What would Allah accomplish by your \\npunishment, if you have given thanks, and \\nhave believed? Allah is Appreciative and \\nCognizant.\\n148. Allah does not like the public uttering of \\nbad language, unless someone was wronged. \\nAllah is Hearing and Knowing.\\n149. If you let a good deed be shown, or conceal \\nit, or pardon an offense—Allah is Pardoning \\nand Capable.\\n150. Those who disbelieve in Allah and His \\nmessengers, and want to separate between \\nAllah and His messengers, and say, “We be\\ufffelieve in some, and reject some,” and wish to \\ntake a path in between.\\n151. These are the unbelievers, truly. We have \\nprepared for the unbelievers a shameful pun\\ufffeishment.\\n35\\n4. WOMEN (an-Nisa’)\\n152. As for those who believe in Allah and His \\nmessengers, and make no distinction be\\ufffetween any of them—He will give them their \\nrewards. Allah is Forgiver and Merciful.\\n153. The People of the Scripture challenge you \\nto bring down to them a book from the sky. \\nThey had asked Moses for something even \\ngreater. They said, “Show us Allah plainly.” \\nThe thunderbolt struck them for their wick\\ufffeedness. Then they took the calf for worship, \\neven after the clear proofs had come to them. \\nYet We pardoned that, and We gave Moses a \\nclear authority.\\n154. And We raised the Mount above them in \\naccordance with their covenant, and We said \\nto them, “Enter the gate humbly”, and We \\nsaid to them, “Do not violate the Sabbath”, \\nand We received from them a solemn pledge.\\n155. But for their violation of their covenant, \\nand their denial of Allah’s revelations, and \\ntheir killing of the prophets unjustly, and \\ntheir saying, “Our minds are closed.” In fact, \\nAllah has sealed them for their disbelief, so \\nthey do not believe, except for a few.\\n156. And for their faithlessness, and their say\\ufffeing against Mary a monstrous slander.\\n157. And for their saying, “We have killed the \\nMessiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, the Messen\\ufffeger of Allah.” In fact, they did not kill him, \\nnor did they crucify him, but it appeared to \\nthem as if they did. Indeed, those who differ \\nabout him are in doubt about it. They have \\nno knowledge of it, except the following of as\\ufffesumptions. Certainly, they did not kill him.\\n158. Rather, Allah raised him up to Himself. \\nAllah is Mighty and Wise.\\n159. There is none from the People of the \\nScripture but will believe in him before his \\ndeath, and on the Day of Resurrection he will \\nbe a witness against them.\\n160. Due to wrongdoing on the part of the \\nJews, We forbade them good things that used \\nto be lawful for them; and for deterring many \\nfrom Allah’s path.\\n161. And for their taking usury, although they \\nwere forbidden it; and for their consuming \\npeople's wealth dishonestly. We have pre\\ufffepared for the faithless among them a painful \\ntorment.\\n162. But those among them firmly rooted in \\nknowledge, and the believers, believe in what \\nwas revealed to you, and in what was revealed \\nbefore you; and the observers of prayers, and \\nthe givers of charity, and the believers in Al\\ufffelah and the Last Day—upon these We will be\\ufffestow an immense reward.\\n163. We have inspired you, as We had inspired \\nNoah and the prophets after him. And We in\\ufffespired Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and \\nJacob, and the Patriarchs, and Jesus, and Job, \\nand Jonah, and Aaron, and Solomon. And \\nWe gave David the Psalms.\\n164. Some messengers We have already told \\nyou about, while some messengers We have \\nnot told you about. And Allah spoke to Mo\\ufffeses directly.\\n165. Messengers delivering good news, and \\nbringing warnings; so that people may have \\nno excuse before Allah after the coming of \\nthe messengers. Allah is Powerful and Wise.\\n166. But Allah bears witness to what He re\\ufffevealed to you. He revealed it with His \\nknowledge. And the angels bear witness. \\nThough Allah is a sufficient witness.\\n167. Those who disbelieve and repel from Al\\ufffelah’s path have gone far astray.\\n168. Those who disbelieve and transgress; Al\\ufffelah is not about to forgive them, nor will He \\nguide them to any path.\\n169. Except to the path of Hell, where they will \\ndwell forever. And that is easy for Allah.\\n170. O people! The Messenger has come to you \\nwith the truth from your Lord, so believe—\\nthat is best for you. But if you disbelieve, to \\nAllah belongs everything in the heavens and \\nthe earth. Allah is Omniscient and Wise.\\n171. O People of the Scripture! Do not exagger\\ufffeate in your religion, and do not say about Al\\ufffelah except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, the \\nson of Mary, is the Messenger of Allah, and \\nHis Word that He conveyed to Mary, and a \\n36\\n5. THE TABLE (al-Ma’idah)\\nSpirit from Him. So believe in Allah and His \\nmessengers, and do not say, “Three.” Re\\ufffefrain—it is better for you. Allah is only one \\nGod. Glory be to Him—that He should have \\na son. To Him belongs everything in the \\nheavens and the earth, and Allah is a suffi\\ufffecient Protector.\\n172. The Messiah does not disdain to be a serv\\ufffeant of Allah, nor do the favored angels. Who\\ufffeever disdains His worship, and is too arro\\ufffegant—He will round them up to Himself al\\ufffetogether.\\n173. But as for those who believe and do good \\nworks, He will pay them their wages in full, \\nand will increase His grace for them. But as \\nfor those who disdain and are too proud, He \\nwill punish them with an agonizing punish\\ufffement. And they will find for themselves, \\napart from Allah, no lord and no savior.\\n174. O people! A proof has come to you from \\nyour Lord, and We sent down to you a clear \\nlight.\\n175. As for those who believe in Allah, and hold \\nfast to Him, He will admit them into mercy \\nand grace from Him, and will guide them to \\nHimself in a straight path.\\n176. They ask you for a ruling. Say, “Allah gives \\nyou a ruling concerning the person who has \\nneither parents nor children.” If a man dies, \\nand leaves no children, and he had a sister, \\nshe receives one-half of what he leaves. And \\nhe inherits from her if she leaves no children. \\nBut if there are two sisters, they receive two\\ufffethirds of what he leaves. If the siblings are \\nmen and women, the male receives the share \\nof two females.” Allah makes things clear for \\nyou, lest you err. Allah is Aware of every\\ufffething.\\n5. THE TABLE\\n(al-Ma’idah)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. O you who believe! Fulfill your commit\\ufffements. Livestock animals are permitted for \\nyou, except those specified to you; but not \\nwild game while you are in pilgrim sanctity. \\nAllah decrees whatever He wills.\\n2. O you who believe! Do not violate Allah’s \\nsacraments, nor the Sacred Month, nor the \\nofferings, nor the garlanded, nor those head\\ufffeing for the Sacred House seeking blessings \\nfrom their Lord and approval. When you \\nhave left the pilgrim sanctity, you may hunt. \\nAnd let not the hatred of people who barred \\nyou from the Sacred Mosque incite you to ag\\ufffegression. And cooperate with one another in \\nvirtuous conduct and conscience, and do not \\ncooperate with one another in sin and hostil\\ufffeity. And fear Allah. Allah is severe in punish\\ufffement.\\n3. Prohibited for you are carrion, blood, the \\nflesh of swine, and animals dedicated to other \\nthan Allah; also the flesh of animals stran\\ufffegled, killed violently, killed by a fall, gored to \\ndeath, mangled by wild animals—except \\nwhat you rescue, and animals sacrificed on \\naltars; and the practice of drawing lots. For it \\nis immoral. Today, those who disbelieve have \\ndespaired of your religion, so do not fear \\nthem, but fear Me. Today I have perfected \\nyour religion for you, and have completed \\nMy favor upon you, and have approved Islam \\nas a religion for you. But whoever is com\\ufffepelled by hunger, with no intent of wrongdo\\ufffeing—Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.\\n4. They ask you what is permitted for them. \\nSay, “Permitted for you are all good things, \\nincluding what trained dogs and falcons \\ncatch for you.” You train them according to \\nwhat Allah has taught you. So eat from what \\nthey catch for you, and pronounce Allah’s \\nname over it. And fear Allah. Allah is Swift in \\nreckoning.\\n5. Today all good things are made lawful for \\nyou. And the food of those given the Scrip\\ufffeture is lawful for you, and your food is lawful \\nfor them. So are chaste believing women, and \\nchaste women from the people who were \\ngiven the Scripture before you, provided you \\ngive them their dowries, and take them in \\nmarriage, not in adultery, nor as mistresses. \\nBut whoever rejects faith, his work will be in \\n37\\n5. THE TABLE (al-Ma’idah)\\nvain, and in the Hereafter he will be among \\nthe losers.\\n6. O you who believe! When you rise to pray, \\nwash your faces and your hands and arms to \\nthe elbows, and wipe your heads, and your \\nfeet to the ankles. If you had intercourse, then \\npurify yourselves. If you are ill, or travelling, \\nor one of you returns from the toilet, or you \\nhad contact with women, and could not find \\nwater, then use some clean sand and wipe \\nyour faces and hands with it. Allah does not \\nintend to burden you, but He intends to pu\\uffferify you, and to complete His blessing upon \\nyou, that you may be thankful.\\n7. And Remember Allah’s blessings upon you, \\nand His covenant which He covenanted with \\nyou; when you said, “We hear and we obey.” \\nAnd remain conscious of Allah, for Allah \\nknows what the hearts contain.\\n8. O you who believe! Be upright to Allah, wit\\ufffenessing with justice; and let not the hatred of \\na certain people prevent you from acting \\njustly. Adhere to justice, for that is nearer to \\npiety; and fear Allah. Allah is informed of \\nwhat you do.\\n9. Allah has promised those who believe and \\nwork righteousness: they will have for\\ufffegiveness and a great reward.\\n10. As for those who disbelieve and reject Our \\nrevelations—these are the inmates of Hell.\\n11. O you who believe! Remember Allah's \\nblessings upon you; when certain people in\\ufffetended to extend their hands against you, and \\nHe restrained their hands from you. So rev\\ufffeerence Allah, and in Allah let the believers \\nput their trust.\\n12. Allah received a pledge from the Children \\nof Israel, and We raised among them twelve \\nchiefs. Allah said, “I am with you; if you per\\ufffeform the prayer, and pay the alms, and be\\ufffelieve in My messengers and support them, \\nand lend Allah a loan of righteousness; I will \\nremit your sins, and admit you into Gardens \\nbeneath which rivers flow. But whoever \\namong you disbelieves afterwards has strayed \\nfrom the right way.”\\n13. Because of their breaking their pledge, We \\ncursed them, and made their hearts hard. \\nThey twist the words out of their context, and \\nthey disregarded some of what they were re\\ufffeminded of. You will always witness deceit \\nfrom them, except for a few of them. But par\\ufffedon them, and overlook. Allah loves the do\\ufffeers of good.\\n14. And from those who say, “We are Chris\\ufffetians,” We received their pledge, but they ne\\ufffeglected some of what they were reminded of. \\nSo We provoked enmity and hatred among \\nthem until the Day of Resurrection; Allah will \\nthen inform them of what they used to craft.\\n15. O People of the Book! Our Messenger has \\ncome to you, clarifying for you much of what \\nyou kept hidden of the Book, and overlook\\ufffeing much. A light from Allah has come to \\nyou, and a clear Book.\\n16. Allah guides with it whoever follows His \\napproval to the ways of peace, and He brings \\nthem out of darkness into light, by His per\\ufffemission, and He guides them in a straight \\npath.\\n17. They disbelieve those who say, “Allah is the \\nChrist, the son of Mary.” Say, “Who can pre\\ufffevent Allah, if He willed, from annihilating the \\nChrist son of Mary, and his mother, and eve\\uffferyone on earth?” To Allah belongs the sover\\ufffeeignty of the heavens and the earth and what \\nis between them. He creates whatever He \\nwills, and Allah has power over everything.\\n18. The Jews and the Christians say, “We are \\nthe children of Allah, and His beloved.” Say, \\n“Why then does He punish you for your \\nsins?” In fact, you are humans from among \\nthose He created. He forgives whom He wills, \\nand He punishes whom He wills. To Allah \\nbelongs the dominion of the heavens and the \\nearth and what lies between them, and to \\nHim is the return.\\n19. O People of the Book! Our Messenger has \\ncome to you, making things clear to you—af\\ufffeter a cessation of messengers—so that you \\ncannot say, “No preacher has come to us, and \\nno warner.” In fact, a preacher has come to \\n38\\n5. THE TABLE (al-Ma’idah)\\nyou, and a warner; and Allah is Capable of \\neverything.\\n20. When Moses said to his people, “O my \\npeople, remember Allah’s blessings upon \\nyou, when He placed prophets among you, \\nand made you kings, and gave you what He \\nnever gave any other people.”\\n21. “O my people, enter the Holy Land which \\nAllah has assigned for you, and do not turn \\nback, lest you return as losers.”\\n22. They said, “O Moses, there are tyrannical \\npeople in it; we will not enter it until they \\nleave it. If they leave it, we will be entering.”\\n23. Two men of those who feared, but whom \\nAllah had blessed, said, “Go at them by the \\ngate; and when you have entered it, you will \\nprevail. And put your trust in Allah, if you are \\nbelievers.”\\n24. They said, “O Moses, we will not enter it, \\never, as long as they are in it. So go ahead, you \\nand your Lord, and fight. We are staying right \\nhere.”\\n25. He said, “My Lord! I have control only over \\nmyself and my brother, so separate between \\nus and between the wicked people.”\\n26. He said, “It is forbidden for them for forty \\nyears. They will wander aimlessly in the land. \\nSo do not grieve over the defiant people.”\\n27. And relate to them the true story of Adam's \\ntwo sons: when they offered an offering, and \\nit was accepted from one of them, but it was \\nnot accepted from the other. He Said, “I will \\nkill you.” He Said, “Allah accepts only from \\nthe righteous.”\\n28. “If you extend your hand to kill me, I will \\nnot extend my hand to kill you; for I fear Al\\ufffelah, Lord of the Worlds.”\\n29. “I would rather you bear my sin and your \\nsin, and you become among the inmates of \\nthe Fire. Such is the reward for the evildoers.”\\n30. Then His soul prompted him to kill his \\nbrother, so he killed him, and became one of \\nthe losers.\\n31. Then Allah sent a raven digging the \\nground, to show him how to cover his broth\\ufffeer's corpse. He said, “Woe to me! I was unable \\nto be like this raven, and bury my brother's \\ncorpse.” So he became full of regrets.\\n32. Because of that We ordained for the Chil\\ufffedren of Israel: that whoever kills a person—\\nunless it is for murder or corruption on \\nearth—it is as if he killed the whole of man\\ufffekind; and whoever saves it, it is as if he saved \\nthe whole of mankind. Our messengers came \\nto them with clarifications, but even after \\nthat, many of them continue to commit ex\\ufffecesses in the land.\\n33. The punishment for those who fight Allah \\nand His Messenger, and strive to spread cor\\uffferuption on earth, is that they be killed, or cru\\ufffecified, or have their hands and feet cut off on \\nopposite sides, or be banished from the land. \\nThat is to disgrace them in this life; and in the \\nHereafter they will have a terrible punish\\ufffement.\\n34. Except for those who repent before you ap\\ufffeprehend them. So know that Allah is Forgiv\\ufffeing and Merciful.\\n35. O you who believe! Be conscious of Allah, \\nand seek the means of approach to Him, and \\nstrive in His cause, so that you may succeed.\\n36. As for those who disbelieve, even if they \\nowned everything on earth, and the like of it \\nwith it, and they offered it to ransom them\\ufffeselves from the torment of the Day of Resur\\uffferection, it will not be accepted from them. \\nFor them is a painful punishment.\\n37. They will want to leave the Fire, but they \\nwill not leave it. For them is a lasting punish\\ufffement.\\n38. As for the thief, whether male or female, \\ncut their hands as a penalty for what they \\nhave reaped—a deterrent from Allah. Allah is \\nMighty and Wise.\\n39. But whoever repents after his crime, and \\nreforms, Allah will accept his repentance. Al\\ufffelah is Forgiving and Merciful.\\n40. Do you not know that to Allah belongs the \\nkingdom of the heavens and the earth? He \\n39\\n5. THE TABLE (al-Ma’idah)\\npunishes whom He wills, and He forgives \\nwhom He wills. And Allah is Capable of eve\\uffferything.\\n41. O Messenger! Do not let those who are \\nquick to disbelief grieve you—from among \\nthose who say with their mouths, “We be\\ufffelieve,” but their hearts do not believe; and \\nfrom among the Jews—listeners to lies, lis\\ufffeteners to other people who did not come to \\nyou. They distort words from their places, \\nand they say, “If you are given this, accept it; \\nbut if you are not given it, beware.” Whom\\ufffeever Allah has willed to divert, you have \\nnothing for him from Allah. Those are they \\nwhose hearts Allah does not intend to purify. \\nFor them is disgrace in this world, and for \\nthem is a great punishment in the Hereafter.\\n42. Listeners to falsehoods, eaters of illicit \\nearnings. If they come to you, judge between \\nthem, or turn away from them. If you turn \\naway from them, they will not harm you in \\nthe least. But if you judge, judge between \\nthem equitably. Allah loves the equitable.\\n43. But why do they come to you for judgment, \\nwhen they have the Torah, in which is Allah’s \\nLaw? Yet they turn away after that. These are \\nnot believers.\\n44. We have revealed the Torah, wherein is \\nguidance and light. The submissive prophets \\nruled the Jews according to it, so did the rab\\ufffebis and the scholars, as they were required to \\nprotect Allah’s Book, and were witnesses to it. \\nSo do not fear people, but fear Me. And do \\nnot sell My revelations for a cheap price. \\nThose who do not rule according to what Al\\ufffelah revealed are the unbelievers.\\n45. And We wrote for them in it: a life for a life, \\nan eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for \\nan ear, a tooth for a tooth, and an equal \\nwound for a wound; but whoever forgoes it \\nin charity, it will serve as atonement for him. \\nThose who do not rule according to what Al\\ufffelah revealed are the evildoers.\\n46. In their footsteps, We sent Jesus son of \\nMary, fulfilling the Torah that preceded him; \\nand We gave him the Gospel, wherein is \\nguidance and light, and confirming the To\\uffferah that preceded him, and guidance and \\ncounsel for the righteous.\\n47. So let the people of the Gospel rule accord\\ufffeing to what Allah revealed in it. Those who \\ndo not rule according to what Allah revealed \\nare the sinners.\\n48. And We revealed to you the Book, with \\ntruth, confirming the Scripture that preceded \\nit, and superseding it. So judge between them \\naccording to what Allah revealed, and do not \\nfollow their desires if they differ from the \\ntruth that has come to you. For each of you \\nWe have assigned a law and a method. Had \\nAllah willed, He could have made you a single \\nnation, but He tests you through what He has \\ngiven you. So compete in righteousness. To \\nAllah is your return, all of you; then He will \\ninform you of what you had disputed.\\n49. And judge between them according to \\nwhat Allah revealed, and do not follow their \\ndesires. And beware of them, lest they lure \\nyou away from some of what Allah has re\\ufffevealed to you. But if they turn away, know \\nthat Allah intends to strike them with some \\nof their sins. In fact, a great many people are \\ncorrupt.\\n50. Is it the laws of the time of ignorance that \\nthey desire? Who is better than Allah in judg\\ufffement for people who are certain?\\n51. O you who believe! Do not take the Jews \\nand the Christians as allies; some of them are \\nallies of one another. Whoever of you allies \\nhimself with them is one of them. Allah does \\nnot guide the wrongdoing people.\\n52. You will see those in whose hearts is sick\\ufffeness racing towards them. They say, “We fear \\nthe wheel of fate may turn against us.” But \\nperhaps Allah will bring about victory, or \\nsome event of His making; thereupon they \\nwill regret what they concealed within them\\ufffeselves.\\n53. Those who believe will say, “Are these the \\nones who swore by Allah with their strongest \\noaths that they are with you?” Their works \\nhave failed, so they became losers.\\n40\\n5. THE TABLE (al-Ma’idah)\\n54. O you who believe! Whoever of you goes \\nback on his religion—Allah will bring a peo\\ufffeple whom He loves and who love Him, kind \\ntowards the believers, stern with the disbe\\ufffelievers. They strive in the way of Allah, and \\ndo not fear the blame of the critic. That is the \\ngrace of Allah; He bestows it upon whomever \\nHe wills. Allah is Embracing and Knowing.\\n55. Your allies are Allah, and His Messenger, \\nand those who believe—those who pray reg\\ufffeularly, and give charity, and bow down.\\n56. Whoever allies himself with Allah, and His \\nMessenger, and those who believe—surely \\nthe Party of Allah is the victorious.\\n57. O you who believe! Do not befriend those \\nwho take your religion in mockery and as a \\nsport, be they from among those who were \\ngiven the Scripture before you, or the disbe\\ufffelievers. And obey Allah, if you are believers.\\n58. When you call to the prayer, they take it as \\na joke and a trifle. That is because they are \\npeople who do not reason.\\n59. Say, “O People of the Scripture! Do you re\\ufffesent us only because we believe in Allah, and \\nin what was revealed to us, and in what was \\nrevealed previously; and most of you are sin\\ufffeners?”\\n60. Say, “Shall I inform you of worse than that \\nfor retribution from Allah? He whom Allah \\nhas cursed, and with whom He became an\\ufffegry; and He turned some of them into apes, \\nand swine, and idol worshipers. These are in \\na worse position, and further away from the \\nright way.”\\n61. When they come to you, they say, “We be\\ufffelieve,” though they have entered with disbe\\ufffelief, and they have departed with it. But Allah \\nis well aware of what they hide.\\n62. You see many of them competing with one \\nanother in sin and hostility, and their con\\ufffesuming of what is illicit. What they have been \\ndoing is truly evil.\\n63. Why do the rabbis and the priests not pre\\ufffevent them from speaking sinfully and from \\nconsuming forbidden wealth? Evil is what \\nthey have been doing.\\n64. The Jews say, “Allah’s hand is tied.” It is \\ntheir hands that are tied, and they are cursed \\nfor what they say. In fact, His hands are out\\ufffestretched; He gives as He wills. Certainly, \\nwhat was revealed to your from your Lord \\nwill increase many of them in defiance and \\nblasphemy. And We placed between them \\nenmity and hatred, until the Day of Resurrec\\ufffetion. Whenever they kindle the fire of war, \\nAllah extinguishes it. And they strive to \\nspread corruption on earth. Allah does not \\nlove the corrupters.\\n65. Had the People of the Scriputure believed \\nand been righteous, We would have remitted \\ntheir sins, and admitted them into the Gar\\ufffedens of Bliss.\\n66. Had they observed the Torah, and the Gos\\ufffepel, and what was revealed to them from their \\nLord, they would have consumed amply from \\nabove them, and from beneath their feet. \\nAmong them is a moderate community, but \\nevil is what many of them are doing. \\n67. O Messenger, convey what was revealed to \\nyou from your Lord. But if you do not, then \\nyou would not have delivered His message. \\nAnd Allah will protect you from the people. \\nAllah does not guide the disbelieving people.\\n68. Say, “O People of the Scripture! You have \\nno basis until you uphold the Torah, and the \\nGospel, and what is revealed to you from \\nyour Lord.” But what is revealed to you from \\nyour Lord will increase many of them in re\\ufffebellion and disbelief, so do not be sorry for \\nthe disbelieving people.\\n69. Those who believe, and the Jews, and the \\nSabians, and the Christians—whoever be\\ufffelieves in Allah and the Last Day, and does \\nwhat is right—they have nothing to fear, nor \\nshall they grieve.\\n70. We made a covenant with the Children of \\nIsrael, and We sent to them messengers. \\nWhenever a messenger came to them with \\nwhat their souls did not desire, some of them \\nthey accused of lying, and others they put to \\ndeath.\\n41\\n5. THE TABLE (al-Ma’idah)\\n71. They assumed there would be no punish\\ufffement, so they turned blind and deaf. Then Al\\ufffelah redeemed them, but then again many of \\nthem turned blind and deaf. But Allah is See\\ufffeing of what they do.\\n72. They disbelieve those who say, “Allah is the \\nMessiah the son of Mary.” But the Messiah \\nhimself said, “O Children of Israel, worship \\nAllah, my Lord and your Lord. Whoever as\\ufffesociates others with Allah, Allah has forbid\\ufffeden him Paradise, and his dwelling is the Fire. \\nThe wrongdoers have no saviors.”\\n73. They disbelieve those who say, “Allah is the \\nthird of three.” But there is no deity except \\nthe One God. If they do not refrain from what \\nthey say, a painful torment will befall those \\namong them who disbelieve.\\n74. Will they not repent to Allah and ask His \\nforgiveness? Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.\\n75. The Messiah son of Mary was only a mes\\ufffesenger, before whom other Messengers had \\npassed away, and his mother was a woman of \\ntruth. They both used to eat food. Note how \\nWe make clear the revelations to them; then \\nnote how deluded they are.\\n76. Say, “Do you worship, besides Allah, what \\nhas no power to harm or benefit you?” But \\nAllah: He is the Hearer, the Knower.\\n77. Say, “O People of the Scripture! Do not ex\\ufffeaggerate in your religion beyond the truth; \\nand do not follow the opinions of people who \\nwent astray before, and misled many, and \\nthemselves strayed off the balanced way.”\\n78. Cursed were those who disbelieved from \\namong the Children of Israel by the tongue of \\nDavid and Jesus son of Mary. That is because \\nthey rebelled and used to transgress.\\n79. They used not to prevent one another from \\nthe wrongs they used to commit. Evil is what \\nthey used to do.\\n80. You will see many of them befriending \\nthose who disbelieve. Terrible is what their \\nsouls prompts them to do. The wrath of Allah \\nfell upon them, and in the torment they will \\nremain.\\n81. Had they believed in Allah and the \\nProphet, and in what was revealed to him, \\nthey would not have befriended them. But \\nmany of them are immoral.\\n82. You will find that the people most hostile \\ntowards the believers are the Jews and the \\npolytheists. And you will find that the nearest \\nin affection towards the believers are those \\nwho say, “We are Christians.” That is because \\namong them are priests and monks, and they \\nare not arrogant.\\n83. And when they hear what was revealed to \\nthe Messenger, you see their eyes overflowing \\nwith tears, as they recognize the truth in it. \\nThey say, “Our Lord, we have believed, so \\ncount us among the witnesses.”\\n84. “And why should we not believe in Allah, \\nand in the truth that has come to us, and hope \\nthat our Lord will include us among the \\nrighteous people?”\\n85. Allah will reward them for what they say—\\nGardens beneath which rivers flow, where \\nthey will stay forever. Such is the reward of \\nthe righteous.\\n86. But as for those who disbelieve and deny \\nOur signs—these are the inmates of the Fire.\\n87. O you who believe! Do not prohibit the \\ngood things Allah has permitted for you, and \\ndo not commit aggression. Allah does not \\nlove the aggressors.\\n88. And eat of the lawful and good things Allah \\nhas provided for you; and be conscious of Al\\ufffelah, in whom you are believers.\\n89. Allah does not hold you accountable for \\nyour unintended oaths, but He holds you ac\\ufffecountable for your binding oaths. The atone\\ufffement for it is by feeding ten needy people \\nfrom the average of what you feed your fam\\ufffeilies, or by clothing them, or by freeing a \\nslave. Anyone who lacks the means shall fast \\nfor three days. That is the atonement for \\nbreaking your oaths when you have sworn \\nthem. So keep your oaths. Thus Allah makes \\nclear His Revelations to you, that you may be \\ngrateful.\\n42\\n5. THE TABLE (al-Ma’idah)\\n90. O you who believe! Intoxicants, gambling, \\nidolatry, and divination are abominations of \\nSatan’s doing. Avoid them, so that you may \\nprosper.\\n91. Satan wants to provoke strife and hatred \\namong you through intoxicants and gam\\ufffebling, and to prevent you from the remem\\ufffebrance of Allah, and from prayer. Will you \\nnot desist?\\n92. Obey Allah and obey the Messenger, and \\nbe cautious. If you turn away—know that the \\nduty of Our Messenger is clear communica\\ufffetion.\\n93. Those who believe and do righteous deeds \\nwill not be blamed for what they may have \\neaten, provided they obey, and believe, and \\ndo good deeds, then maintain piety and faith, \\nthen remain righteous and charitable. Allah \\nloves the charitable.\\n94. O you who believe! Allah will test you with \\nsomething of the game your hands and spears \\nobtain, that Allah may know who fears Him \\nat heart. Whoever commits aggression after \\nthat will have a painful punishment.\\n95. O you who believe! do not kill game while \\nyou are in pilgrim sanctity. Whoever of you \\nkills any intentionally, its penalty shall be a \\ndomestic animal comparable to what he \\nkilled, as determined by two honest persons \\namong you—an offering delivered to the \\nKaabah. Or he may atone by feeding the \\nneedy, or its equivalent in fasting, so that he \\nmay taste the consequences of his conduct. \\nAllah forgives what is past. But whoever re\\ufffepeats, Allah will take revenge on him. Allah is \\nAlmighty, Avenger.\\n96. Permitted for you is the catch of sea, and \\nits food—as sustenance for you and for trav\\ufffeelers. But forbidden for you is the game of \\nland while you are in pilgrim sanctity. And \\nfear Allah, to whom you will be gathered.\\n97. Allah has appointed the Kaabah, the Sacred \\nHouse, a sanctuary for the people, and the Sa\\ufffecred Month, and the offerings, and the gar\\ufffelanded. That you may know that Allah knows \\neverything in the heavens and the earth, and \\nthat Allah is Cognizant of all things.\\n98. Know that Allah is severe in retribution, \\nand that Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.\\n99. The Messenger’s sole duty is to convey. Al\\ufffelah knows what you reveal and what you con\\ufffeceal.\\n100. Say: “The bad and the good are not equal, \\neven though the abundance of the bad may \\nimpress you. So be conscious of Allah, O you \\nwho possess intelligence, that you may suc\\ufffeceed.”\\n101. O you who believe! Do not ask about \\nthings that would trouble you if disclosed to \\nyou. But if you were to ask about them while \\nthe Quran is being revealed, they will become \\nobvious to you. Allah forgives that. Allah is \\nForgiving and Clement.\\n102. A people before you asked about them, but \\nthen came to reject them. \\n103. Allah did not institute the superstitions of \\nBahirah, Saibah, Wasilah, or of Hami; but \\nthose who disbelieve fabricate lies about Al\\ufffelah—most of them do not understand.\\n104. And when it is said to them, “Come to \\nwhat Allah has revealed, and to the Messen\\ufffeger,” they say, “Sufficient for us is what we \\nfound our forefathers upon.” Even if their \\nforefathers knew nothing, and were not \\nguided?\\n105. O you who believe! You are responsible \\nfor your own souls. He who has strayed can\\ufffenot harm you if you are guided. To Allah is \\nyou return, all of you, and He will inform you \\nof what you used to do.\\n106. O you who believe! When death ap\\ufffeproaches one of you, let two reliable persons \\nfrom among you act as witnesses to the mak\\ufffeing of a bequest, or two persons from another \\npeople if you are travelling in the land and the \\nevent of death approaches you. Engage them \\nafter the prayer. If you have doubts, let them \\nswear by Allah: “We will not sell our testi\\ufffemony for any price, even if he was a near rel\\ufffeative, and we will not conceal Allah’s testi\\ufffemony, for then we would be sinners.”\\n107. If it is discovered that they are guilty of \\nperjury: let two others take their place, two \\n43\\n6. LIVESTOCK (al-An’am)\\nfrom among those responsible for the claim, \\nand have them swear by Allah, “Our testi\\ufffemony is more truthful than their testimony, \\nand we will not be biased, for then we would \\nbe wrongdoers.”\\n108. That makes it more likely that they will \\ngive true testimony, fearing that their oaths \\nmight be contradicted by subsequent oaths. \\nSo fear Allah, and listen. Allah does not guide \\nthe disobedient people.\\n109. On the Day when Allah will gather the \\nmessengers, then say, “What response were \\nyou given?” They will say, “We have no \\nknowledge; it is you who are the Knower of \\nthe unseen.”\\n110. When Allah will say, “O Jesus son of Mary, \\nrecall My favor upon you and upon your \\nmother, how I supported you with the Holy \\nSpirit. You spoke to the people from the crib, \\nand in maturity. How I taught you the Scrip\\ufffeture and wisdom, and the Torah and the Gos\\ufffepel. And recall that you molded from clay the \\nshape of a bird, by My leave, and then you \\nbreathed into it, and it became a bird, by My \\nleave. And you healed the blind and the lep\\uffferous, by My leave; and you revived the dead, \\nby My leave. And recall that I restrained the \\nChildren of Israel from you when you \\nbrought them the clear miracles. But those \\nwho disbelieved among them said, `This is \\nnothing but obvious sorcery.'“\\n111. “And when I inspired the disciples: `Be\\ufffelieve in Me and in My Messenger.' They said, \\n`We have believed, so bear witness that We \\nhave submitted.'“\\n112. “And when the disciples said, 'O Jesus son \\nof Mary, is your Lord able to bring down for \\nus a feast from heaven?' He said, 'Fear Allah, \\nif you are believers.'“\\n113. They said, “We wish to eat from it, so that \\nour hearts may be reassured, and know that \\nyou have told us the truth, and be among \\nthose who witness it.”\\n114. Jesus son of Mary said, “O Allah, our Lord, \\nsend down for us a table from heaven, to be a \\nfestival for us, for the first of us, and the last \\nof us, and a sign from You; and provide for \\nus; You are the Best of providers.”\\n115. Allah said, “I will send it down to you. But \\nwhoever among you disbelieves thereafter, I \\nwill punish him with a punishment the like of \\nwhich I never punish any other being.”\\n116. And Allah will say, “O Jesus son of Mary, \\ndid you say to the people, `Take me and my \\nmother as gods rather than Allah?'“ He will \\nsay, “Glory be to You! It is not for me to say \\nwhat I have no right to. Had I said it, You \\nwould have known it. You know what is in \\nmy soul, and I do not know what is in your \\nsoul. You are the Knower of the hidden.\\n117. I only told them what You commanded \\nme: that you shall worship Allah, my Lord \\nand your Lord. And I was a witness over them \\nwhile I was among them; but when You took \\nme to Yourself, you became the Watcher over \\nthem—You are Witness over everything.\\n118. If You punish them, they are Your serv\\ufffeants; but if You forgive them, You are the\\nMighty and Wise.”\\n119. Allah will say, “This is a Day when the \\ntruthful will benefit from their truthfulness.” \\nThey will have Gardens beneath which rivers \\nflow, wherein they will remain forever. Allah \\nis pleased with them, and they are pleased \\nwith Him. That is the great attainment.\\n120. To Allah belongs the sovereignty of the \\nheavens and the earth and what lies in them, \\nand He has power over everything.\\n6. LIVESTOCK\\n(al-An’am)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Praise be to Allah, Who created the heavens \\nand the earth, and made the darkness and the \\nlight. Yet those who disbelieve ascribe equals \\nto their Lord.\\n2. It is He who created you from clay, then de\\ufffecided a term—a term determined by him. Yet \\nyou doubt.\\n44\\n6. LIVESTOCK (al-An’am)\\n3. He is Allah in the heavens and the earth. He \\nknows what you keep secret and what you \\nmake public; and He knows what you earn.\\n4. Not one of their Lord’s signs comes to them, \\nbut they turn away from it.\\n5. They denied the truth when it has come to \\nthem; but soon will reach them the news of \\nwhat they used to ridicule.\\n6. Have they not considered how many gener\\ufffeations We destroyed before them? We had \\nestablished them on earth more firmly than \\nWe established you, and We sent the clouds \\npouring down abundant rain on them, and \\nWe made rivers flow beneath them. But We \\ndestroyed them for their sins, and established \\nother civilizations after them.\\n7. Had We sent down upon you a book on pa\\ufffeper, and they had touched it with their hands, \\nthose who disbelieve would have said, “This \\nis nothing but plain magic.”\\n8. And they say, “Why was an angel not sent \\ndown to him.” Had We sent down an angel, \\nthe matter would have been settled, and they \\nwould not have been reprieved.\\n9. Had We made him an angel, We would \\nhave made him a man, and confused them \\nwhen they are already confused.\\n10. Messengers before you were ridiculed, but \\nthose who mocked them became besieged by \\nwhat they ridiculed.\\n11. Say, “Travel the earth and observe the final \\nfate of the deniers.”\\n12. Say, “To whom belongs what is in the heav\\ufffeens and the earth?” Say, “To Allah.” He has \\ninscribed for Himself mercy. He will gather \\nyou to the Day of Resurrection, in which \\nthere is no doubt. Those who lost their souls \\ndo not believe.\\n13. To Him belongs whatever rests in the night \\nand the day. He is the Hearing, the Knowing.\\n14. Say, “Shall I take for myself a protector \\nother than Allah, Originator of the heavens \\nand the earth, and He feeds and is not fed?” \\nSay, “I am instructed to be the first of those \\nwho submit.” And do not be among the idol\\ufffeaters.\\n15. Say, “I fear, should I defy my Lord, the pun\\ufffeishment of a tremendous Day.”\\n16. Whoever is spared on that Day—He had \\nmercy on him. That is the clear victory.\\n17. If Allah touches you with adversity, none \\ncan remove it except He. And if He touches \\nyou with good—He is Capable of everything.\\n18. He is the Supreme over His servants. He is \\nthe Wise, the Expert.\\n19. Say, “What thing is more solemn in testi\\ufffemony?” Say, “Allah is Witness between you \\nand me. This Quran was revealed to me, that \\nI may warn you with it, and whomever it may \\nreach. Do you indeed testify that there are \\nother gods with Allah?” Say, “I myself do not \\ntestify.” Say, “He is but One God, and I am \\ninnocent of your idolatry.”\\n20. Those to whom We have given the Book \\nrecognize it as they recognize their own chil\\ufffedren; but those who have lost their souls do \\nnot believe.\\n21. Who does greater wrong than someone \\nwho fabricates lies against Allah, or denies \\nHis revelations? The wrongdoers will not \\nsucceed.\\n22. On the Day when We gather them all to\\ufffegether, then say to the idolaters, “Where are \\nyour idols, those you used to claim?”\\n23. Then their only argument will be to say, \\n“By Allah, our Lord, we were not idolaters.”\\n24. Look how they lied to themselves. And \\nwhat they invented deserted them.\\n25. Among them are those who listen to you; \\nbut We place covers over their hearts, to pre\\ufffevent them from understanding it, and heavi\\ufffeness in their ears. Even if they see every sign, \\nthey will not believe in it. Until, when they \\ncome to you, to argue with you, those who \\ndisbelieve will say, “These are nothing but \\nmyths of the ancients.”\\n26. They keep others from it, and avoid it \\nthemselves; but they ruin only their own \\nsouls, and they do not realize.\\n45\\n6. LIVESTOCK (al-An’am)\\n27. If only you could see, when they are made \\nto stand before the Fire; they will say, “If only \\nwe could be sent back, and not reject the rev\\ufffeelations of our Lord, and be among the faith\\ufffeful.”\\n28. What they used to conceal before will be\\ufffecome clear to them. And even if they were \\nsent back, they would revert to what they \\nwere forbidden. They are liars.\\n29. And they say, “There is nothing but our life \\nin this world, and we will not be resurrected.”\\n30. If only you could see, when they are sta\\ufffetioned before their Lord. He will say, “Is this \\nnot real?” They will say, “Yes indeed, by our \\nLord.” He will say, “Then taste the torment \\nfor having disbelieved.”\\n31. Losers are those who deny the encounter \\nwith Allah. Then, when the Hour comes \\nupon them suddenly, they will say, “Alas for \\nus, how we have neglected it.” And they will \\ncarry their burdens on their backs—evil is \\nwhat they carry.\\n32. The life of this world is nothing but game \\nand distraction, but the Home of the Hereaf\\ufffeter is better for those who are righteous. Do \\nyou not understand?\\n33. We know that what they say grieves you. It \\nis not you they reject, but it is Allah's revela\\ufffetions that the wicked deny.\\n34. Other messengers before you were re\\ufffejected, but they endured rejection and perse\\ufffecution until Our help came to them. There \\ncan be no change to Allah’s words. News of \\nthe Messengers has already reached you.\\n35. If you find their rejection hard to bear, then \\nif you can, seek a tunnel into the earth, or a \\nstairway into the heaven, and bring them a \\nsign. Had Allah willed, He could have gath\\ufffeered them to guidance. So do not be of the ig\\ufffenorant.\\n36. Only those who listen will respond. As for \\nthe dead, Allah will resurrect them; then to \\nHim they will be returned.\\n37. And they say, “If only a sign could come \\ndown to him from his Lord.” Say, “Allah is \\nAble to send down a sign, but most of them \\ndo not know.”\\n38. There is no animal on land, nor a bird fly\\ufffeing with its wings, but are communities like \\nyou. We neglected nothing in the Scripture. \\nThen to their Lord they will be gathered.\\n39. Those who reject Our revelations are deaf \\nand dumb, in total darkness. Whomever Al\\ufffelah wills, He leaves astray; and whomever He \\nwills, He sets on a straight path.\\n40. Say, “Have you considered? if Allah's pun\\ufffeishment came upon you, or the Hour over\\ufffetook you, would you call upon any other than \\nAllah, if you are sincere?”\\n41. In fact, it is Him you will call upon; and if \\nHe wills, he will remove what you called Him \\nfor, and you will forget what you idolized.\\n42. We sent messengers to communities be\\ufffefore you, and We afflicted them with suffer\\ufffeing and hardship, that they may humble \\nthemselves.\\n43. If only, when Our calamity came upon \\nthem, they humbled themselves. But their \\nhearts hardened, and Satan made their deeds \\nappear good to them.\\n44. Then, when they disregarded what they \\nwere reminded of, We opened for them the \\ngates of all things. Until, when they delighted \\nin what they were given, We seized them sud\\ufffedenly; and at once, they were in despair.\\n45. Thus the last remnant of the people who \\ndid wrong was cut off. And praise be to Allah, \\nLord of the Worlds.\\n46. Say, “Have you considered? If Allah took \\naway your hearing and your sight, and set a \\nseal on your hearts, what god other than Al\\ufffelah would restore them to you?” Note how \\nWe explain the revelations in various ways, \\nyet they still turn away.\\n47. Say, “Have you considered? if Allah's pun\\ufffeishment descended on you suddenly or grad\\ufffeually, would any be destroyed except the \\nwrongdoing people?”\\n48. We sent the messengers only as bearers of \\ngood news and as warners. Those who believe \\n46\\n6. LIVESTOCK (al-An’am)\\nand reform have nothing to fear, nor shall \\nthey grieve.\\n49. But as for those who reject Our revelations, \\ntorment will afflict them because of their de\\ufffefiance.\\n50. Say, “I do not say to you that I possess the \\ntreasuries of Allah, nor do I know the future, \\nnor do I say to you that I am an angel. I only \\nfollow what is inspired to me.” Say, “Are the \\nblind and the seeing alike? Do you not \\nthink?”\\n51. And warn with it those who fear to be gath\\ufffeered before their Lord—they have no protec\\ufffetor or intercessor apart from him—perhaps \\nthey will grow in piety.\\n52. And do not drive away those who call upon \\ntheir Lord, morning and evening, seeking His \\nattention. You are not accountable for them \\nin any way, nor are they accountable for you \\nin any way. If you drive them away, you \\nwould be one of the unjust.\\n53. Thus We try some of them by means of \\nothers, that they may say, “Are these the ones \\nwhom Allah has favored from among us?” Is \\nAllah not aware of the appreciative?\\n54. When those who believe in Our revelations \\ncome to you, say, “Peace be upon you, your \\nLord has prescribed mercy for Himself. \\nWhoever among you does wrong out of igno\\uffferance, and then repents afterwards and re\\ufffeforms—He is Forgiving and Merciful.”\\n55. Thus We explain the revelations, and ex\\ufffepose the path of the unrighteous.\\n56. Say, “I am forbidden from worshiping \\nthose you pray to besides Allah.” Say, “I will \\nnot follow your desires; else I would be lost \\nand not be of those guided.”\\n57. Say, “I stand on clear evidence from my \\nLord, and you have rejected Him. I do not \\npossess what you seek me to hasten; the deci\\ufffesion belongs solely to Allah. He states the \\ntruth, and He is the Best of Judges.”\\n58. Say, “If I possessed what you seek me to \\nhasten, the matter between you and me \\nwould have been settled. Allah is well aware \\nof the unjust.”\\n59. With Him are the keys of the unseen; none \\nknows them except He. And He knows eve\\uffferything on land and in the sea. Not a leaf falls \\nbut He knows it; and there is not a single \\ngrain in the darkness of earth, nor is there an\\ufffeything wet or dry, but is in a clear record.\\n60. It is He Who takes you by night, and He \\nknows what you earn by day. Then He raises \\nyou up in it, until a fixed term is fulfilled. \\nThen to Him is your return, then He will in\\ufffeform you of what you used to do.\\n61. He is the Conqueror over His servants, and \\nHe sends guardians over you, until, when \\ndeath overtakes one of you, Our envoys take \\nhim away, and they never fail.\\n62. Then they are brought back to Allah, their \\nTrue Master. Unquestionably, His is the \\njudgment, and He is the Swiftest of reckon\\ufffeers.\\n63. Say, “Who delivers you from the darkness \\nof land and sea?” You call upon Him humbly \\nand inwardly: “If He delivers us from this, \\nWe will surely be among the thankful.” \\n64. Say, “It is Allah who delivers you from it, \\nand from every disaster. Yet then you associ\\ufffeate others with Him.”\\n65. Say, “He is Able to send upon you an afflic\\ufffetion, from above you, or from under your \\nfeet. Or He can divide you into factions, and \\nmake you taste the violence of one another. \\nNote how We explain the revelations, so that \\nthey may understand.”\\n66. But your people rejected it, though it is the \\ntruth. Say, “I am not responsible for you.”\\n67. For every happening is a finality, and you \\nwill surely know.\\n68. When you encounter those who gossip \\nabout Our revelations, turn away from them, \\nuntil they engage in anothertopic. But should \\nSatan make you forget, do not sit after the \\nrecollection with the wicked people.\\n47\\n6. LIVESTOCK (al-An’am)\\n69. The righteous are in no way accountable \\nfor them; it is only a reminder, that they may \\nbe careful.\\n70. So leave alone those who take their religion \\nfor play and pastime, and whom the worldly \\nlife has deceived. But remind with it, lest a \\nsoul becomes damned on account of what it \\nhas earned. It has no helper or intercessor be\\ufffesides Allah. Even if it offers every equivalent, \\nnone will be accepted from it. These are the \\nones who are delivered to perdition by their \\nactions. They will have a drink of scalding \\nwater, and a painful punishment, because \\nthey used to disbelieve.\\n71. Say, “Shall we invoke besides Allah some\\ufffething that can neither benefit us nor harm us,\\nand turn back on our heels after Allah has \\nguided us; like someone seduced by the devils \\nand confused on earth, who has friends call\\ufffeing him to guidance: 'Come to us'?” Say, “The \\nguidance of Allah is the guidance, and we are \\ncommanded to surrender to the Lord of the \\nUniverse.”\\n72. “And to perform the prayers, and to revere \\nHim; it is to Him that you will be gathered.” \\n73. It is He who created the heavens and the \\nearth in truth. On the Day when He says: \\n“Be,” it will be. His saying is the truth, and \\nHis is the sovereignty on the Day when the \\ntrumpet is blown. The Knower of secrets and \\ndeclarations. He is the Wise, the Expert.\\n74. Abraham said to his father Azar, “Do you \\ntake idols for gods? I see that you and your \\npeople are in evident error.”\\n75. Thus We showed Abraham the empire of \\nthe heavens and the earth, that he might be \\none of those with certainty.\\n76. When the night fell over him, he saw a \\nplanet. He said, “This is my lord.” But when \\nit set, he said, “I do not love those that set.”\\n77. Then, when he saw the moon rising, he \\nsaid, “This is my lord.” But when it set, he \\nsaid, “If my Lord does not guide me, I will be \\none of the erring people.”\\n78. Then, when he saw the sun rising, he said, \\n“This is my lord, this is bigger.” But when it \\nset, he said, “O my people, I am innocent of \\nyour idolatry. \\n79. I have directed my attention towards Him \\nWho created the heavens and the earth—a \\nmonotheist—and I am not of the idolaters.”\\n80. And his people argued with him. He said, \\n“Do you argue with me about Allah, when He\\nhas guided me? I do not fear what you asso\\ufffeciate with Him, unless my Lord wills it. My \\nLord comprehends all things in knowledge. \\nWill you not reconsider?\\n81. And why should I fear those you associate \\nwith Him, and you do not fear associating \\nothers with Allah for which He sent down to \\nyou no authority? Which side is more enti\\ufffetled to security, if you are aware?”\\n82. Those who believe, and do not obscure \\ntheir faith with wrongdoing—those will have \\nsecurity, and they are guided.\\n83. That was Our argument which We gave to \\nAbraham against his people. We elevate by \\ndegrees whomever We will. Your Lord is \\nWise and Informed.\\n84. And We gave him Isaac and Jacob—each \\nof them We guided. And We guided Noah \\npreviously; and from his descendants David, \\nand Solomon, and Job, and Joseph, and Mo\\ufffeses, and Aaron. Thus We reward the right\\ufffeeous.\\n85. And Zechariah, and John, and Jesus, and \\nElias—every one of them was of the upright.\\n86. And Ishmael, and Elijah, and Jonah, and \\nLot—We favored each one of them over all \\nother people.\\n87. And of their ancestors, and their descend\\ufffeants, and their siblings—We chose them, and \\nguided them to a straight path.\\n88. Such is Allah’s guidance. He guides with it \\nwhomever He wills of His servants. Had they \\nassociated, their deeds would have gone in \\nvain.\\n89. Those are they to whom We gave the Book, \\nand wisdom, and prophethood. If these reject \\nthem, We have entrusted them to others who \\ndo not reject them.\\n48\\n6. LIVESTOCK (al-An’am)\\n90. Those are they whom Allah has guided, so \\nfollow their guidance. Say, “I ask of you no \\ncompensation for it; it is just a reminder for \\nall mankind.”\\n91. They do not value Allah as He should be \\nvalued, when they say, “Allah did not reveal \\nanything to any human being.” Say, “Who re\\ufffevealed the Scripture which Moses brought—\\na light and guidance for humanity?” You put \\nit on scrolls, displaying them, yet concealing \\nmuch. And you were taught what you did not \\nknow—neither you, nor your ancestors. Say, \\n“Allah;” then leave them toying away in their \\nspeculation.\\n92. This too is a Scripture that We revealed—\\nblessed—verifying what preceded it, that you \\nmay warn the Mother of Cities and all around \\nit. Those who believe in the Hereafter believe \\nin it, and are dedicated to their prayers.\\n93. Who does greater wrong than someone \\nwho invents falsehood against Allah, or says,\\n“It was revealed to me,” when nothing was re\\ufffevealed to him, or says, “I will reveal the like of \\nwhat Allah revealed”? If only you could see \\nthe wrongdoers in the floods of death, as the \\nangels with arms outstretched: “Give up your \\nsouls. Today you are being repaid with the \\ntorment of shame for having said about Allah \\nother than the truth, and for being too proud \\nto accept His revelations.”\\n94. “You have come to Us individually, just as \\nWe created you the first time, leaving behind \\nyou everything We gave you. We do not see \\nwith you your intercessors—those you \\nclaimed were your partners. The link be\\ufffetween you is cut, and what you had asserted \\nhas failed you.”\\n95. It is Allah Who splits the grain and the \\nseed. He brings the living from the dead, and \\nHe brings the dead from the living. Such is \\nAllah. So how could you deviate?\\n96. It is He Who breaks the dawn. And He \\nmade the night for rest, and the sun and the \\nmoon for calculation. Such is the disposition \\nof the Almighty, the All-Knowing.\\n97. And it is He Who created the stars for you, \\nthat you may be guided by them in the dark\\ufffeness of land and sea. We thus explain the rev\\ufffeelations for people who know.\\n98. And it is He who produced you from a sin\\ufffegle person, then a repository, then a deposi\\ufffetory. We have detailed the revelations for \\npeople who understand.\\n99. And it is He who sends down water from \\nthe sky. With it We produce vegetation of all \\nkinds, from which We bring greenery, from \\nwhich We produce grains in clusters. And \\npalm-trees with hanging clusters, and vine\\ufffeyards, and olives, and pomegranates—similar \\nand dissimilar. Watch their fruits as they \\ngrow and ripen. Surely in this are signs for \\npeople who believe. \\n100. Yet they attributed to Allah partners—the \\nsprites—although He created them. And they \\ninvented for Him sons and daughters, with\\ufffeout any knowledge. Glory be to Him. He is \\nexalted, beyond what they describe.\\n101. Originator of the heavens and the earth—\\nhow can He have a son when He never had a \\ncompanion? He created all things, and He \\nhas knowledge of all things. \\n102. Such is Allah, your Lord. There is no god \\nexcept He, the Creator of all things; so wor\\ufffeship Him. He is responsible for everything.\\n103. No vision can grasp Him, but His grasp is \\nover all vision. He is the Subtle, the Expert.\\n104. “Insights have come to you from your \\nLord. Whoever sees, it is to the benefit of his \\nsoul; and whoever remains blind, it is to its \\ndetriment. I am not a guardian over you.”\\n105. We thus diversify the revelations, lest they \\nsay, “You have studied,” and to clarify them \\nfor people who know.\\n106. Follow what was revealed to you from \\nyour Lord. There is no god but He. And turn \\naway from the polytheists.\\n107. Had Allah willed, they would not have \\npracticed idolatry. We did not appoint you as \\na guardian over them, and you are not a man\\ufffeager over them.\\n49\\n6. LIVESTOCK (al-An’am)\\n108. Do not insult those they call upon besides \\nAllah, lest they insult Allah out of hostility \\nand ignorance. We made attractive to every \\ncommunity their deeds. Then to their Lord is \\ntheir return, and He will inform them of what \\nthey used to do.\\n109. They swear by Allah, with their most sol\\ufffeemn oaths, that if a miracle were to come to \\nthem, they would believe in it. Say, “The mir\\ufffeacles are only with Allah.” But how do you \\nknow? Even if it did come, they still would \\nnot believe.\\n110. And We turn away their hearts and their \\nvisions, as they refused to believe in it the first \\ntime, and We leave them blundering in their \\nrebellion.\\n111. Even if We sent down the angels to them, \\nand the dead spoke to them, and We gathered \\nall things before them, they still would not \\nbelieve, unless Allah wills; but most of them \\nare ignorant.\\n112. Likewise, We have assigned for every \\nprophet an enemy—human and jinn devils—\\ninspiring one another with fancy words in or\\ufffeder to deceive. But had your Lord willed, they \\nwould not have done it. So leave them to their \\nfabrications.\\n113. So that the hearts of those who do not be\\ufffelieve in the Hereafter may incline to it, and be \\ncontent with it, and that they may perpetrate \\nwhatever they perpetrate.\\n114. “Shall I seek a judge other than Allah, \\nwhen He is the One who revealed to you the \\nBook, explained in detail?” Those to whom \\nWe gave the Book know that it is the truth re\\ufffevealed from your Lord. So do not be of those \\nwho doubt.\\n115. The Word of your Lord has been com\\ufffepleted, in truth and justice. There is no \\nchanging to His words. He is the Hearer, the \\nKnower.\\n116. If you were to obey most of those on earth, \\nthey would divert you from Allah’s path. \\nThey follow nothing but assumptions, and \\nthey only conjecture.\\n117. Your Lord knows best who strays from His \\npath, and He knows best the guided ones.\\n118. So eat of that over which the Name of Al\\ufffelah was pronounced, if you indeed believe in \\nHis revelations.\\n119. And why should you not eat of that over \\nwhich the Name of Allah is pronounced, \\nwhen He has detailed for you what is prohib\\ufffeited for you, unless you are compelled by ne\\ufffecessity? Many lead astray with their opinions, \\nthrough lack of knowledge. Your Lord knows \\nbest the transgressors.\\n120. So abandon sin, outward and inward. \\nThose who commit sins will be repaid for \\nwhat they used to perpetrate.\\n121. And do not eat from that over which the \\nName of Allah was not pronounced, for it is \\nabomination. The devils inspire their follow\\ufffeers to argue with you; but if you obey them, \\nyou would be polytheists.\\n122. Is he who was dead, then We gave him life, \\nand made for him a light by which he walks \\namong the people, like he who is in total \\ndarkness, and cannot get out of it? Thus the \\ndoings of disbelievers are made to appear \\ngood to them.\\n123. And thus We set up in every city its lead\\ufffeing wicked sinners, to conspire in it, but they \\nconspire only against themselves, and they do \\nnot realize it.\\n124. When a sign comes to them, they say, “We \\nwill not believe unless we are given the like of \\nwhat was given to Allah’s messengers.” Allah \\nknows best where to place His message. Hu\\ufffemiliation from Allah and severe torment will \\nafflict the criminals for their scheming.\\n125. Whomever Allah desires to guide, He \\nspreads open his heart to Islam; and whom\\ufffeever He desires to misguide, He makes his \\nheart narrow, constricted, as though he were \\nclimbing up the sky. Allah thus lays defile\\ufffement upon those who do not believe.\\n126. This is the straight path of your Lord. We \\nhave explained the revelations in detail for \\npeople who recollect.\\n50\\n6. LIVESTOCK (al-An’am)\\n127. For them is the Home of Peace with their \\nLord, and He is their Master—because of \\nwhat they used to do.\\n128. On the Day when He gathers them all to\\ufffegether: “O assembly of jinn, you have ex\\ufffeploited multitudes of humans.” Their adher\\ufffeents among mankind will say, “Our Lord, we \\nhave profited from one another, but we have \\nreached the term that you have assigned for \\nus.” He will say, “The Fire is your dwelling, \\nwherein you will remain, except as Allah \\nwills. Your Lord is Wise and Informed.\\n129. Thus We make some of the wrongdoers \\nbefriend one another, because of what they \\nused to do.\\n130. “O assembly of jinn and humans, did there \\nnot come to you messengers from among \\nyou, relating to you My revelations, and \\nwarning you of the meeting of this Day of \\nyours?” They will say, “We testify against \\nourselves.” The life of the world seduced \\nthem. They will testify against themselves \\nthat they were disbelievers.\\n131. That is because your Lord would not de\\ufffestroy towns for injustice while their inhabit\\ufffeants are unaware.\\n132. They all have ranks according to what they \\ndid; and your Lord is not unaware of what \\nthey do.\\n133. Your Lord is the Rich Beyond Need, the \\nPossessor of Mercy. If He wills, He can do \\naway with you, and substitute whomever He \\nwills in your place, just as He produced you \\nfrom the descendants of another people.\\n134. What you are promised is coming, and \\nyou cannot thwart it.\\n135. Say, “O my people! Work according to \\nyour ability, and so will I.” You will come to \\nknow to whom will belong the sequel of the \\nabode.” The wrongdoers will not prevail.\\n136. And they set aside for Allah a share of the \\ncrops and the livestock He created, and they \\nsay, “This is for Allah,” according to their \\nclaim, “and this is for our idols.” But the share \\nof their idols does not reach Allah, yet the \\nshare of Allah reaches their idols. Evil is their \\njudgment.\\n137. Likewise, their idols entice many idolaters \\nto kill their children, in order to lead them to \\ntheir ruin, and confuse them in their religion. \\nHad Allah willed, they would not have done\\nit; so leave them to their fraud.\\n138. And they say, “These animals and crops \\nare restricted; none may eat them except \\nthose we permit,” by their claims, and ani\\ufffemals whose backs are forbidden, and animals \\nover which they do not pronounce the name \\nof Allah—fabricating lies against Him. He \\nwill repay them for what they used to invent.\\n139. And they say, “What lies in the wombs of \\nthese animals is exclusively for our males, \\nand prohibited to our wives.” But if it is still\\ufffeborn, they can share in it. He will surely pun\\ufffeish them for their allegations. He is Wise and \\nKnowing.\\n140. Lost are those who kill their children fool\\ufffeishly, with no basis in knowledge, and forbid \\nwhat Allah has provided for them—innova\\ufffetions about Allah. They have gone astray. \\nThey are not guided.\\n141. It is He who produces gardens, both culti\\ufffevated and wild, and date-palms, and crops of \\ndiverse tastes, and olives and pomegranates, \\nsimilar and dissimilar. Eat of its fruit when it \\nyields, and give its due on the day of its har\\ufffevest, and do not waste. He does not love the \\nwasteful.\\n142. Among the livestock are some for trans\\ufffeportation, and some for clothing. Eat of what \\nAllah has provided for you, and do not follow \\nthe footsteps of Satan. He is to you an out\\uffferight enemy.\\n143. Eight pairs: two of the sheep, and two of \\nthe goats. Say, “Did He forbid the two males, \\nor the two females, or what the wombs of the \\ntwo females contain? Inform me with \\nknowledge, if you are truthful.”\\n144. And two of the camels, and two of the cat\\ufffetle. Say, “Did He forbid the two males, or the \\ntwo females, or what the wombs of the two \\n51\\n6. LIVESTOCK (al-An’am)\\nfemales contain? Were you present when Al\\ufffelah enjoined this upon you?” Who does \\ngreater wrong than he who invents lies and \\nattributes them to Allah, in order to mislead \\npeople without knowledge? Allah does not \\nguide the wicked people.\\n145. Say, “In what was revealed to me, I find \\nnothing forbidden to a consumer who eats it, \\nexcept carrion, or spilled blood, or the flesh \\nof swine—because it is impure—or a sinful \\noffering dedicated to other than Allah. But if \\nsomeone is compelled by necessity, without \\nbeing deliberate or malicious—your Lord is \\nForgiving and Merciful.\\n146. For the Jews We forbade everything with \\nclaws. As of cattle and sheep: We forbade \\nthem their fat, except what adheres to their \\nbacks, or the entrails, or what is mixed with \\nbone. This is how We penalized them for \\ntheir inequity. We are indeed truthful.\\n147. If they accuse you of lying, say, “Your Lord \\nis Possessor of infinite mercy, but His wrath \\ncannot be averted from the guilty people.”\\n148. The polytheists will say, “Had Allah willed, \\nwe would not have practiced idolatry, nor \\nwould have our forefathers, nor would we \\nhave prohibited anything.” Likewise those \\nbefore them lied, until they tasted Our might. \\nSay, “Do you have any knowledge that you \\ncan produce for us? You follow nothing but \\nconjecture, and you only guess.”\\n149. Say, “To Allah belongs the conclusive ar\\ufffegument. Had He willed, He would have \\nguided you all.”\\n150. Say, “Produce your witnesses who would \\ntestify that Allah has prohibited this.” If they \\ntestify, do not testify with them. And do not \\nfollow the whims of those who deny Our rev\\ufffeelation, and those who do not believe in the \\nHereafter, and those who equate others with \\ntheir Lord.\\n151. Say, “Come, let me tell you what your Lord \\nhas forbidden you: that you associate nothing \\nwith Him; that you honor your parents; that \\nyou do not kill your children because of pov\\ufffeerty—We provide for you and for them; that \\nyou do not come near indecencies, whether \\noutward or inward; and that you do not kill \\nthe soul which Allah has sanctified—except \\nin the course of justice. All this He has en\\ufffejoined upon you, so that you may under\\ufffestand.”\\n152. And do not come near the property of the \\norphan, except with the best intentions, until \\nhe reaches maturity. And give full weight and \\nfull measure, equitably. We do not burden \\nany soul beyond its capacity. And when you \\nspeak, be fair, even if it concerns a close rela\\ufffetive. And fulfill your covenant with Allah. All \\nthis He has enjoined upon you, so that you \\nmay take heed.\\n153. This is My path, straight, so follow it. And \\ndo not follow the other paths, lest they divert \\nyou from His path. All this He has enjoined \\nupon you, that you may refrain from wrong\\ufffedoing.\\n154. Then We gave Moses the Scripture, per\\ufffefect for the righteous, and explaining every\\ufffething clearly, and a beacon, and mercy, that \\nthey may believe in the encounter with their \\nLord.\\n155. This too is a blessed Scripture that We re\\ufffevealed; so follow it, and be righteous, that you \\nmay receive mercy. \\n156. Lest you say, “The Scripture was revealed \\nto two parties before us, and we were una\\ufffeware of their teachings.”\\n157. Or lest you say, “Had the Scripture been \\nrevealed to us, we would have been better \\nguided than they.” Clarification has come to \\nyou from your Lord, and guidance, and \\nmercy. Who then does greater wrong than he \\nwho gives the lie to Allah's messages, and \\nturns away from them? We will repay those \\nwho turn away from Our messages with the \\nworst kind of punishment, because of their \\nturning away.\\n158. Are they waiting for anything but for the \\nangels to come to them, or for your Lord to \\narrive, or for some of your Lord’s signs to \\ncome? On the Day when some of your Lord’s \\nsigns come, no soul will benefit from its faith \\nunless it had believed previously, or had \\n52\\n7. THE ELEVATIONS (al-A’raf)\\nearned goodness through its faith. Say, “Wait, \\nwe too are waiting.”\\n159. As for those who divided their religion \\nand became sects—you have nothing to do \\nwith them. Their case rests with Allah; then \\nHe will inform them of what they used to do.\\n160. Whoever comes up with a good deed will \\nhave ten times its like; and whoever comes up \\nwith an evil deed will be repaid only with its \\nequivalent—they will not be wronged.\\n161. Say, “My Lord has guided me to a straight \\npath, an upright religion, the creed of Abra\\ufffeham the Monotheist, who was not a polythe\\ufffeist.”\\n162. Say, “My prayer and my worship, and my \\nlife and my death, are devoted to Allah, the \\nLord of the Worlds.\\n163. No associate has He. Thus I am com\\ufffemanded, and I am the first of those who sub\\ufffemit.\\n164. Say, “Am I to seek a Lord other than Allah, \\nwhen He is the Lord of all things?” No soul \\ngets except what it is due, and no soul bears \\nthe burdens of another. Then to your Lord is \\nyour return, then He will inform you regard\\ufffeing your disputes.\\n165. It is He who made you successors on the \\nearth, and raised some of you in ranks over \\nothers, in order to test you through what He \\nhas given you. Your Lord is Quick in retribu\\ufffetion, and He is Forgiving and Merciful.\\n7. THE ELEVATIONS\\n(al-A’raf)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Alif, Lam, Meem, Saad.\\n2. A Scripture was revealed to you, so let there \\nbe no anxiety in your heart because of it. You \\nare to warn with it—and a reminder for the \\nbelievers.\\n3. Follow what is revealed to you from your \\nLord, and do not follow other masters beside \\nHim. Little you recollect.\\n4. How many a town have We destroyed? Our \\nmight came upon them by night, or while \\nthey were napping.\\n5. When Our might came upon them, their \\nonly cry was, “We were indeed wrongdoers.”\\n6. We will question those to whom messen\\ufffegers were sent, and We will question the mes\\ufffesengers.\\n7. We will narrate to them with knowledge, \\nfor We were never absent.\\n8. The scales on that Day will be just. Those \\nwhose weights are heavy—it is they who are \\nthe successful.\\n9. But as for those whose weights are light—it \\nis they who have lost their souls, because they \\nused to mistreat Our revelations.\\n10. We have established you firmly on earth, \\nand made for you in it livelihood—but rarely \\ndo you give thanks.\\n11. We created you, then We shaped you, then \\nWe said to the angels, “Bow down before \\nAdam;” so they bowed down, except for Sa\\ufffetan; he was not of those who bowed down.\\n12. He said, “What prevented you from bow\\ufffeing down when I have commanded you?” He \\nsaid, “I am better than he; You created me \\nfrom fire, and You created him from mud.”\\n13. He said, “Get down from it! It is not for you \\nto act arrogantly in it. Get out! You are one of \\nthe lowly!”\\n14. He said, “Give me respite, until the Day \\nthey are resurrected.”\\n15. He said, “You are of those given respite.”\\n16. He said, “Because you have lured me, I will \\nwaylay them on Your straight path.\\n17. Then I will come at them from before \\nthem, and from behind them, and from their \\nright, and from their left; and you will not \\nfind most of them appreciative.”\\n18. He said, “Get out of it, despised and van\\ufffequished. Whoever among them follows \\nyou—I will fill up Hell with you all.\\n19. And you, Adam, inhabit the Garden, you \\nand your wife, and eat whatever you wish; but \\n53\\n7. THE ELEVATIONS (al-A’raf)\\ndo not approach this tree, lest you become \\nsinners.”\\n20. But Satan whispered to them, to reveal to \\nthem their nakedness, which was invisible to \\nthem. He said, “Your Lord has only forbid\\ufffeden you this tree, lest you become angels, or \\nbecome immortals.”\\n21. And he swore to them, “I am a sincere ad\\ufffevisor to you.”\\n22. So he lured them with deceit. And when \\nthey tasted the tree, their nakedness became \\nevident to them, and they began covering \\nthemselves with the leaves of the Garden. \\nAnd their Lord called out to them, “Did I not \\nforbid you from this tree, and say to you that \\nSatan is a sworn enemy to you?”\\n23. They said, “Our Lord, we have done wrong \\nto ourselves. Unless You forgive us, and have \\nmercy on us, we will be among the losers.”\\n24. He said, “Fall, some of you enemies to one \\nanother. On earth you will have residence \\nand livelihood for a while.”\\n25. He said, “In it you will live, and in it you \\nwill die, and from it you will be brought out.”\\n26. O children of Adam! We have provided \\nyou with clothing to cover your bodies, and \\nfor luxury. But the clothing of piety—that is \\nbest. These are some of Allah’s revelations, so \\nthat they may take heed.\\n27. O Children of Adam! Do not let Satan se\\ufffeduce you, as he drove your parents out of the \\nGarden, stripping them of their garments, to \\nshow them their nakedness. He sees you, him \\nand his clan, from where you cannot see \\nthem. We have made the devils friends of \\nthose who do not believe.\\n28. And when they commit an indecency, they \\nsay, “We found our parents doing this, and \\nAllah has commanded us to do it.” Say, “Al\\ufffelah does not command indecencies. Are you \\nattributing to Allah what you do not know?”\\n29. Say, “My Lord commands justice, and to \\nstand devoted at every place of worship. So \\ncall upon Him, and dedicate your faith to \\nHim alone. Just as He originated you, so you \\nwill return.”\\n30. Some He has guided, and some have de\\ufffeserved misguidance. They have adopted the \\ndevils for patrons rather than Allah, and they \\nassume that they are guided.\\n31. O Children of Adam! Dress properly at \\nevery place of worship, and eat and drink, but \\ndo not be excessive. He does not love the ex\\ufffecessive.\\n32. Say, “Who forbade Allah’s finery which He \\nhas produced for His servants, and the de\\ufffelights of livelihood?” Say, “They are for those \\nwho believe, in this present world, but exclu\\ufffesively theirs on the Day of Resurrection.” We \\nthus detail the revelations for people who \\nknow.\\n33. Say, “My Lord has forbidden immorali\\ufffeties—both open and secret—and sin, and un\\ufffejustified aggression, and that you associate \\nwith Allah anything for which He revealed no \\nsanction, and that you say about Allah what \\nyou do not know.”\\n34. For every nation is an appointed time. \\nWhen their time has come, they cannot delay \\nit by one hour, nor can they advance it.\\n35. O Children of Adam! When messengers \\nfrom among you come to you, relating to you \\nMy revelations—whoever practices piety and \\nreforms—upon them shall be no fear, nor \\nshall they grieve.\\n36. But as for those who reject Our revelations, \\nand are too proud to accept them—these are \\nthe inmates of the Fire, where they will re\\ufffemain forever.\\n37. Who does greater wrong than he who in\\ufffevents lies about Allah, or denies His revela\\ufffetions? These—their share of the decree will \\nreach them. Until, when Our envoys come to \\nthem, to take their souls away, they will say, \\n“Where are they whom you used to pray to \\nbesides Allah?” They will say, “They have \\nabandoned us,” and they will testify against \\nthemselves that they were faithless.\\n38. He will say, “Join the crowds of jinn and \\nhumans who have gone into the Fire before \\n54\\n7. THE ELEVATIONS (al-A’raf)\\nyou.” Every time a crowd enters, it will curse \\nits sister-crowd. Until, when they are all in it, \\nthe last of them will say to the first of them, \\n“Our Lord, these are the ones who misled us, \\nso inflict on them a double punishment in the \\nFire.” He will say, “Each will have a double, \\nbut you do not know.”\\n39. The first of them will say to the last of them, \\n“You have no advantage over us, so taste the \\ntorment for what you used to earn.”\\n40. Those who reject Our revelations and are \\ntoo arrogant to uphold them—the doors of \\nHeaven will not be opened for them, nor will \\nthey enter Paradise, until the camel passes \\nthrough the eye of the needle. Thus We repay \\nthe guilty.\\n41. For them is a couch of hell, and above them \\nare sheets of fire. Thus We repay the wrong\\ufffedoers.\\n42. As for those who believe and do righteous \\nworks—We never burden any soul beyond its \\ncapacity—these are the inhabitants of the \\nGarden; abiding therein eternally.\\n43. We will remove whatever rancor is in their \\nhearts. Rivers will flow beneath them. And \\nthey will say, “Praise be to Allah, who has \\nguided us to this. Had Allah not guided us, \\nwe would never be guided. The messengers of \\nour Lord did come with the truth.” And it will \\nbe proclaimed to them, “This is the Garden \\nyou are made to inherit, on account of what \\nyou used to do.”\\n44. And the inhabitants of the Garden will call \\nout to the inmates of the Fire, “We found \\nwhat our Lord promised us to be true; did \\nyou find what your Lord promised you to be \\ntrue?” They will say, “Yes.” Thereupon a \\ncaller will announce in their midst, “The \\ncurse of Allah is upon the wrongdoers.”\\n45. “Those who hinder from the path of Allah, \\nand seek to distort it, and who deny the Here\\ufffeafter.”\\n46. And between them is a partition, and on \\nthe Elevations are men who recognize every\\ufffeone by their features. They will call to the in\\ufffehabitants of the Garden, “Peace be upon \\nyou.” They have not entered it, but they are \\nhoping.\\n47. And when their eyes are directed towards \\nthe inmates of the Fire, they will say, “Our \\nLord, do not place us among the wrongdoing \\npeople.”\\n48. And the dwellers of the Elevations will call \\nto men they recognize by their features, say\\ufffeing, “Your hoardings did not avail you, nor \\ndid your arrogance.”\\n49. “Are these the ones you swore Allah will \\nnot touch with mercy?” “Enter the Garden; \\nyou have nothing to fear, and you will not \\ngrieve.”\\n50. The inmates of the Fire will call on the in\\ufffehabitants of the Garden, “Pour some water \\nover us, or some of what Allah has provided \\nfor you.” They will say, “Allah has forbidden \\nthem for the disbelievers.”\\n51. Those who took their religion lightly, and \\nin jest, and whom the worldly life deceived. \\nToday We will ignore them, as they ignored \\nthe meeting on this Day of theirs, and they \\nused to deny Our revelations.\\n52. We have given them a Scripture, which We \\ndetailed with knowledge—guidance and \\nmercy for people who believe.\\n53. Are they waiting for anything but its fulfill\\ufffement? The Day its fulfillment comes true, \\nthose who disregarded it before will say, “The \\nmessengers of our Lord did come with the \\ntruth. Have we any intercessors to intercede \\nfor us? Or, could we be sent back, to behave \\ndifferently from the way we behaved before?” \\nThey ruined their souls, and what they used \\nto invent has failed them.\\n54. Your Lord is Allah; He who created the \\nheavens and the earth in six days, then estab\\ufffelished Himself on the Throne. The night \\novertakes the day, as it pursues it persistently; \\nand the sun, and the moon, and the stars are \\nsubservient by His command. His is the cre\\ufffeation, and His is the command. Blessed is Al\\ufffelah, Lord of all beings.\\n55. Call upon your Lord humbly and privately. \\nHe does not love the aggressors.\\n55\\n7. THE ELEVATIONS (al-A’raf)\\n56. And do not corrupt on earth after its refor\\ufffemation, and pray to Him with fear and hope. \\nAllah’s mercy is close to the doers of good.\\n57. It is He who sends the wind ahead of His \\nmercy. Then, when they have gathered up \\nheavy clouds, We drive them to a dead land, \\nwhere We make water come down, and with \\nit We bring out all kinds of fruits. Thus We \\nbring out the dead—perhaps you will reflect.\\n58. As for the good land, it yields its produce \\nby the leave of its Lord. But as for the bad, it \\nproduces nothing but hardship and misery. \\nThus We explain the revelations in various \\nways for people who are thankful.\\n59. We sent Noah to his people. He said, “O \\nmy people! Worship Allah; you have no god \\nother than Him. I fear for you the punish\\ufffement of a tremendous Day.”\\n60. The dignitaries among his people said, \\n“We see that you are in obvious error.”\\n61. He said, “O my people, I am not in error, \\nbut I am a messenger from the Lord of the\\nWorlds.”\\n62. “I deliver to you the messages of my Lord, \\nand I advise you, and I know from Allah what \\nyou do not know.”\\n63. “Do you wonder that a reminder has come \\nto you from your Lord, through a man from \\namong you, to warn you, and to lead you to \\nrighteousness, so that you may attain \\nmercy?”\\n64. But they called him a liar. So We saved him \\nand those with him in the Ark, and We \\ndrowned those who rejected Our revelations. \\nThey were blind people.\\n65. And to Aad, their brother Hud. He said, “O \\nmy people! Worship Allah; you have no god \\nother than Him. Will you not take heed?”\\n66. The elite of his people who disbelieved \\nsaid, “We see foolishness in you, and we think \\nthat you are a liar.”\\n67. He said, “O my people! There is no foolish\\ufffeness in me, but I am a messenger from the \\nLord of the Worlds.\\n68. “I convey to you the messages of my Lord, \\nand I am a trustworthy adviser to you.”\\n69. “Are you surprised that a reminder has \\ncome to you from your Lord, through a man \\nfrom among you, to warn you? Remember \\nhow He made you successors after the people \\nof Noah, and increased you greatly in stature. \\nAnd remember Allah’s blessings, so that you \\nmay prosper.”\\n70. They said, “Did you come to us to make us \\nworship Allah alone, and abandon what our \\nancestors used to worship? Then bring us \\nwhat you threaten us with, if you are truth\\ufffeful.”\\n71. He said, “Condemnation and wrath have \\nbefallen you from your Lord. Are you arguing \\nwith me over names, which you and your an\\ufffecestors invented, for which Allah sent down \\nno authority? Just wait; I am waiting with \\nyou.” \\n72. So We saved him and those with him, by \\nmercy from Us, and We cut off the roots of \\nthose who rejected Our revelations and were \\nnot believers.\\n73. And to Thamood, their brother Saleh. He \\nsaid, “O my people! Worship Allah; you have\\nno god other than Him. Clarification has \\ncome to you from your Lord. This she-camel \\nof Allah is a sign for you. So leave her to graze \\non Allah’s earth, and do her no harm, lest a \\npainful penalty seizes you.”\\n74. “And remember how He made you succes\\ufffesors after Aad, and settled you in the land. \\nYou make for yourselves mansions on its \\nplains, and carve out dwellings in the moun\\ufffetains. So remember Allah’s benefits, and do \\nnot roam the earth corruptingly.”\\n75. The elite of his people, who were arrogant, \\nsaid to the common people who had believed, \\n“Do you know that Saleh is sent from his \\nLord?” They said, “We are believers in what \\nhe was sent with.”\\n76. Those who were arrogant said, “We reject \\nwhat you believe in.”\\n77. So they hamstrung the she-camel, and de\\ufffefied the command of their Lord, and said, “O \\n56\\n7. THE ELEVATIONS (al-A’raf)\\nSaleh, bring upon us what you threaten us \\nwith, if you are one of the messengers.”\\n78. Whereupon the quake overtook them, and \\nthey became lifeless bodies in their homes. \\n79. Then he turned away from them, and said, \\n“O my people, I have delivered to you the \\nmessage of my Lord, and I have advised you, \\nbut you do not like those who give advice.”\\n80. And Lot, when he said to his people, “Do \\nyou commit lewdness no people anywhere \\nhave ever committed before you?”\\n81. “You lust after men rather than women. \\nYou are an excessive people.”\\n82. And his people's only answer was to say, \\n“Expel them from your town; they are purist \\npeople.”\\n83. But We saved him and his family, except \\nfor his wife; she was of those who lagged be\\ufffehind.\\n84. And We rained down on them a rain; note \\nthe consequences for the sinners.\\n85. And to Median, their brother Shuaib. He \\nsaid, “O my people, worship Allah; you have \\nno god other than Him. A clear proof has \\ncome to you from your Lord. Give full meas\\ufffeure and weight, and do not cheat people out \\nof their rights, and do not corrupt the land \\nonce it has been set right. This is better for \\nyou, if you are believers.”\\n86. “And do not lurk on every path, making \\nthreats and turning away from the path of Al\\ufffelah those who believe in Him, seeking to dis\\ufffetort it. And remember how you were few, and \\nhow He made you numerous. So note the \\nconsequences for the corrupters.”\\n87. “Since some of you believed in what I was \\nsent with, and some did not believe, be pa\\ufffetient until Allah judges between us; for He is \\nthe Best of Judges.”\\n88. The arrogant elite among his people said, \\n“O Shuaib, We will evict you from our town, \\nalong with those who believe with you, unless \\nyou return to our religion.” He said, “Even if \\nwe are unwilling?”\\n89. “We would be fabricating falsehood \\nagainst Allah, if we were to return to your re\\ufffeligion, after Allah has saved us from it. It is \\nnot for us to return to it, unless Allah, our \\nLord, wills. Our Lord embraces all things in \\nknowledge. In Allah we place our trust. Our \\nLord, decide between us and our people in \\ntruth, for You are the Best of Deciders.”\\n90. The elite of his people who disbelieved \\nsaid, “If you follow Shuaib, you will be los\\ufffeers.”\\n91. Thereupon, the quake struck them; and \\nthey became lifeless bodies in their homes.\\n92. Those who rejected Shuaib—as if they \\nnever prospered therein. Those who rejected \\nShuaib—it was they who were the losers.\\n93. So he turned away from them, and said, “O \\nmy people, I have delivered to you the mes\\ufffesages of my Lord, and I have advised you, so \\nwhy should I grieve over a disbelieving peo\\ufffeple?”\\n94. We did not send any prophet to any town \\nbut We afflicted its people with misery and \\nadversity, so that they may humble them\\ufffeselves.\\n95. Then We substituted prosperity in place of \\nhardship. Until they increased in number, \\nand said, “Adversity and prosperity has \\ntouched our ancestors.” Then We seized \\nthem suddenly, while they were unaware.\\n96. Had the people of the towns believed and \\nturned righteous, We would have opened for \\nthem the blessings of the heaven and the \\nearth; but they rejected the truth, so We \\nseized them by what they were doing.\\n97. Do the people of the towns feel secure that \\nOur might will not come upon them by night, \\nwhile they sleep?\\n98. Do the people of the towns feel secure that \\nOur might will not come upon them by day, \\nwhile they play?\\n99. Do they feel safe from Allah’s plan? None \\nfeel safe from Allah’s plan except the losing \\npeople.\\n57\\n7. THE ELEVATIONS (al-A’raf)\\n100. Is it not guidance for those who inherit the \\nland after its inhabitants, that if We willed, \\nWe could strike them for their sins? And seal \\nup their hearts, so that they would not hear?\\n101. These towns—We narrate to you some of \\ntheir tales. Their messengers came to them \\nwith the clear signs, but they would not be\\ufffelieve in what they had rejected previously. \\nThus Allah seals the hearts of the disbelievers.\\n102. We found most of them untrue to their \\ncovenants; We found most of them corrupt.\\n103. Then, after them, We sent Moses with Our \\nmiracles to Pharaoh and his establishment, \\nbut they denounced them. So consider the \\nend of the evildoers.\\n104. Moses said, “O Pharaoh, I am a messenger \\nfrom the Lord of the Worlds.”\\n105. “It is only proper that I should not say \\nabout Allah anything other than the truth. I \\nhave come to you with clear evidence from \\nyour Lord, so let the Children of Israel go \\nwith me.”\\n106. He said, “If you brought a miracle, then \\npresent it, if you are truthful.”\\n107. So he threw his staff, and it was an appar\\ufffeent serpent.\\n108. And He pulled out his hand, and it was \\nwhite to the onlookers.\\n109. The notables among Pharaoh’s people \\nsaid, “This is really a skilled magician.”\\n110. “He wants to evict you from your land, so \\nwhat do you recommend?”\\n111. They said, “Put him off, and his brother, \\nand send heralds to the cities.”\\n112. “And let them bring you every skillful ma\\ufffegician.”\\n113. The magicians came to Pharaoh, and said, \\n“Surely there is a reward for us, if we are the \\nvictors.”\\n114. He said, “Yes, and you will be among my \\nfavorites.”\\n115. They said, “O Moses! Either you throw, or \\nwe are the ones to throw.”\\n116. He said, “You throw!” And when they \\nthrew, they beguiled the eyes of the people, \\nand intimidated them, and produced a \\nmighty magic.\\n117. And We inspired Moses: “Throw your \\nstaff.” And at once, it swallowed what they \\nwere faking.\\n118. So the truth came to pass, and what they \\nwere producing came to nothing.\\n119. There they were defeated, and utterly re\\ufffeduced.\\n120. And the magicians fell to their knees.\\n121. They said, “We have believed in the Lord \\nof the Worlds.”\\n122. “The Lord of Moses and Aaron.”\\n123. Pharaoh said, “Did you believe in Him be\\ufffefore I have given you permission? This is \\nsurely a conspiracy you schemed in the city, \\nin order to expel its people from it. You will \\nsurely know.”\\n124. “I will cut off your hands and your feet on \\nopposite sides; then I will crucify you all.”\\n125. They said, “It is to our Lord that we will \\nreturn.”\\n126. “You are taking vengeance on us only be\\ufffecause we have believed in the signs of our \\nLord when they have come to us.” “Our Lord! \\nPour out patience upon us, and receive our \\nsouls in submission.”\\n127. The chiefs of Pharaoh's people said, “Will \\nyou let Moses and his people cause trouble in \\nthe land, and forsake you and your gods?” He \\nsaid, “We will kill their sons, and spare their \\nwomen. We have absolute power over them.”\\n128. Moses said to his people, “Seek help in Al\\ufffelah, and be patient. The earth belongs to Al\\ufffelah. He gives it in inheritance to whomever \\nHe wills of His servants, and the future be\\ufffelongs to the righteous.”\\n129. They said, “We were persecuted before \\nyou came to us, and after you came to us.” He \\nsaid, “Perhaps your Lord will destroy your \\nenemy, and make you successors in the land; \\nthen He will see how you behave.”\\n58\\n7. THE ELEVATIONS (al-A’raf)\\n130. And We afflicted the people of Pharaoh \\nwith barren years, and with shortage of crops, \\nthat they may take heed.\\n131. When something good came their way, \\nthey said, “This is ours.” And when some\\ufffething bad happened to them, they ascribed \\nthe evil omen to Moses and those with him. \\nIn fact, their omen is with Allah, but most of \\nthem do not know.\\n132. And they said, “No matter what sign you \\nbring us, to bewitch us with, we will not be\\ufffelieve in you.”\\n133. So We let loose upon them the flood, and \\nthe locusts, and the lice, and the frogs, and \\nblood—all explicit signs—but they were too \\narrogant. They were a sinful people.\\n134. Whenever a plague befell them, they \\nwould say, “O Moses, pray to your Lord for \\nus, according to the covenant He made with \\nyou. If you lift the plague from us, we will be\\ufffelieve in you, and let the Children of Israel go \\nwith you.”\\n135. But when We lifted the plague from them, \\nfor a term they were to fulfill, they broke their \\npromise.\\n136. So We took vengeance on them, and \\ndrowned them in the sea—because they re\\ufffejected Our signs, and paid no heed to them.\\n137. And We made the oppressed people in\\ufffeherit the eastern and western parts of the \\nland, which We had blessed. Thus the fair \\npromise of your Lord to the Children of Israel \\nwas fulfilled, because of their endurance. And \\nWe destroyed what Pharaoh and his people \\nhad built, and what they had harvested.\\n138. And We delivered the Children of Israel \\nacross the sea. And when they came upon a \\npeople who were devoted to some statues of \\ntheirs, they said, “O Moses, make for us a god, \\nas they have gods.” He said, “You are truly an \\nignorant people.”\\n139. “What these people are concerned with is \\nperdition, and their deeds are based on false\\ufffehoods.”\\n140. He said, “Shall I seek for you a god other \\nthan Allah, when He has favored you over all \\nother people?”\\n141. Remember how We saved you from Phar\\ufffeaoh’s people, who subjected you to the worst \\nof sufferings—killing your sons and sparing \\nyour women. In that was a tremendous trial \\nfrom your Lord.\\n142. And We appointed to Moses thirty nights, \\nand completed them with ten; and thus the \\ntime appointed by his Lord was forty nights. \\nAnd Moses said to his brother Aaron: “Take \\nmy place among my people, and be upright, \\nand do not follow the way of the mischief\\ufffemakers.”\\n143. And when Moses came to Our appoint\\ufffement, and his Lord spoke to him, he said, \\n“My Lord, allow me to look and see You.” He \\nsaid, “You will not see Me, but look at the \\nmountain; if it stays in its place, you will see \\nMe.” But when his Lord manifested Himself \\nto the mountain, He turned it into dust, and \\nMoses fell down unconscious. Then, when he \\nrecovered, he said, “Glory be to you, I repent \\nto you, and I am the first of the believers.”\\n144. He said, “O Moses, I have chosen you over \\nall people for My messages and for My \\nWords. So take what I have given you, and be \\none of the thankful.”\\n145. And We inscribed for him in the Tablets \\nall kinds of enlightenments, and decisive ex\\ufffeplanation of all things. “Hold fast to them, \\nand exhort your people to adopt the best of \\nthem. I will show you the fate of the sinners.”\\n146. I will turn away from My revelations those \\nwho behave proudly on earth without justifi\\ufffecation. Even if they see every sign, they will \\nnot believe in it; and if they see the path of \\nrectitude, they will not adopt it for a path; and \\nif they see the path of error, they will adopt it \\nfor a path. That is because they denied Our \\nrevelations, and paid no attention to them.\\n147. Those who deny Our revelations and the \\nmeeting of the Hereafter—their deeds will \\ncome to nothing. Will they be repaid except \\naccording to what they used to do?\\n59\\n7. THE ELEVATIONS (al-A’raf)\\n148. In his absence, the people of Moses \\nadopted a calf made from their ornaments—\\na body which lowed. Did they not see that it \\ncould not speak to them, nor guide them in \\nany way? They took it for worship. They were \\nin the wrong.\\n149. Then, when they regretted, and realized \\nthat they had erred, they said, “Unless our \\nLord extends His mercy to us, and forgives \\nus, we will be among the losers.”\\n150. And when Moses returned to his people, \\nangry and disappointed, he said, “What an \\nawful thing you did in my absence. Did you\\nforsake the commandments of your Lord so \\nhastily?” And he threw down the tablets; and \\nhe took hold of his brother’s head, dragging \\nhim towards himself. He said, “Son of my \\nmother, the people have overpowered me, \\nand were about to kill me; so do not allow the \\nenemies to gloat over me, and do not count \\nme among the unjust people.”\\n151. He said, “My Lord, forgive me and my \\nbrother, and admit us into Your mercy; for \\nyou are the Most Merciful of the merciful.” \\n152. Those who idolized the calf have incurred \\nwrath from their Lord, and humiliation in \\nthis life. We thus requite the innovators.\\n153. As for those who commit sins, and then \\nrepent afterwards and believe—your Lord, \\nthereafter, is Forgiving and Merciful.\\n154. When the anger abated in Moses, he took \\nup the tablets. In their transcript is guidance \\nand mercy for those in awe of their Lord.\\n155. And Moses chose from his people seventy \\nmen for Our appointment. When the tremor \\nshook them, he said, “My Lord, had You \\nwilled, You could have destroyed them be\\ufffefore, and me too. Will you destroy us for what \\nthe fools among us have done? This is but \\nYour test—with it You misguide whomever \\nYou will, and guide whomever You will. You \\nare our Protector, so forgive us, and have \\nmercy on us. You are the Best of Forgivers.”\\n156. “And inscribe for us goodness in this \\nworld, and in the Hereafter. We have turned \\nto You.” He said, “My punishment—I inflict \\nit upon whomever I will, but My mercy en\\ufffecompasses all things. I will specify it for those \\nwho act righteously and practice regular \\ncharity, and those who believe in Our signs.”\\n157. Those who follow the Messenger, the Un\\ufffelettered Prophet, whom they find mentioned \\nin the Torah and the Gospel in their posses\\ufffesion. He directs them to righteousness, and \\ndeters them from evil, and allows for them all \\ngood things, and prohibits for them wicked\\ufffeness, and unloads the burdens and the shack\\ufffeles that are upon them. Those who believe in \\nhim, and respect him, and support him, and \\nfollow the light that came down with him—\\nthese are the successful.\\n158. Say, “O people, I am the Messenger of Al\\ufffelah to you all—He to whom belongs the king\\ufffedom of the heavens and the earth. There is no \\ngod but He. He gives life and causes death.” \\nSo believe in Allah and His Messenger, the \\nUnlettered Prophet, who believes in Allah \\nand His words. And follow him, that you may \\nbe guided.\\n159. Among the people of Moses is a commu\\ufffenity that guides by truth, and thereby does \\njustice.\\n160. We divided them into twelve tribal com\\ufffemunities. And We inspired Moses, when his \\npeople asked him for something to drink: \\n“Strike the rock with your staff.” Whereupon \\ntwelve springs gushed from it. Each group \\nrecognized its drinking-place. And We \\nshaded them with clouds, and We sent down \\nupon them manna and quails: “Eat of the \\ngood things We have provided for you.” They \\ndid not wrong Us, but they used to wrong \\ntheir own selves.\\n161. And it was said to them, “Settle this town, \\nand eat therein whatever you wish, and speak \\nmodestly, and enter the gate in humility—\\nWe will forgive your sins, and will promote \\nthe righteous.”\\n162. But the wicked among them substituted \\nother words for the words given to them; so \\nWe sent down upon them a plague from the \\nsky, because of their wrongdoing.\\n60\\n7. THE ELEVATIONS (al-A’raf)\\n163. Ask them about the town by the sea, when \\nthey violated the Sabbath. When they ob\\ufffeserved the Sabbath, their fish would come to \\nthem abundantly. But when they violated the \\nSabbath, their fish would not come to them. \\nThus We tried them because they disobeyed.\\n164. And when a group of them said, “Why do \\nyou counsel a people whom Allah will anni\\ufffehilate, or punish with a severe punishment?” \\nThey said, “As an excuse to your Lord, and so \\nthat they may become righteous.”\\n165. Then, when they neglected what they were \\nreminded of, We saved those who prohibited \\nevil, and We seized those who did wrong with \\na terrible punishment, because of their sinful\\ufffeness.\\n166. Then, when they rebelled against the com\\ufffemands to refrain, We said to them, “Be des\\ufffepicable apes.”\\n167. Your Lord has announced that, He would \\nsend against them, until the Day of Resurrec\\ufffetion, those who would inflict terrible suffer\\ufffeing upon them. Your Lord is swift in retribu\\ufffetion, yet He is Forgiving and Merciful.\\n168. And We scattered them into communities \\non earth. Some of them righteous, and some \\nof them short of that. And We tested them \\nwith fortunes and misfortunes, so that they \\nmay return.\\n169. They were succeeded by generations who \\ninherited the Scripture and chose the materi\\ufffeals of this world, saying, “We will be for\\ufffegiven.” And should similar materials come \\ntheir way, they would again seize them. Did \\nthey not make a covenant to uphold the \\nScripture, and to not say about Allah except \\nthe truth? Did they not study its contents? \\nBut the Home of the Hereafter is better for \\nthe cautious; will you not understand?\\n170. Those who adhere to the Scripture, and \\npractice prayer—We will not waste the re\\ufffeward of the reformers.\\n171. And when We suspended the mountain \\nover them, as if it was an umbrella, and they \\nthought it would fall on them: “Hold fast to \\nwhat We have given you, and remember what \\nit contains, so that you may be saved.”\\n172. And when Your Lord summoned the de\\ufffescendants of Adam, and made them testify \\nabout themselves. “Am I not your Lord?” \\nThey said, “Yes, we testify.” Thus you cannot \\nsay on the Day of Resurrection, “We were un\\ufffeaware of this.”\\n173. Nor can you Say, “Our ancestors practiced \\nidolatry before; and we are their descendants \\nwho came after them; will you destroy us for \\nwhat the falsifiers did?”\\n174. We thus elaborate the revelations, so that \\nthey may return.\\n175. And relate to them the story of him to \\nwhom We delivered Our signs, but he de\\ufffetached himself from them, so Satan went af\\ufffeter him, and he became one of the perverts.\\n176. Had We willed, We could have elevated \\nhim through them; but he clung to the \\nground, and followed his desires. His meta\\ufffephor is that of a dog: if you chase it, it pants; \\nand if you leave it alone, it pants. Such is the \\nmetaphor of the people who deny Our signs. \\nSo tell the tale, so that they may ponder.\\n177. Evil is the metaphor of the people who re\\ufffeject Our signs and wrong themselves.\\n178. Whomever Allah guides is the guided one. \\nAnd whomever He sends astray—these are \\nthe losers.\\n179. We have destined for Hell multitudes of \\njinn and humans. They have hearts with \\nwhich they do not understand. They have \\neyes with which they do not see. They have \\nears with which they do not hear. These are \\nlike cattle. In fact, they are further astray. \\nThese are the heedless.\\n180. To Allah belong the Most Beautiful \\nNames, so call Him by them, and disregard \\nthose who blaspheme His names. They will \\nbe repaid for what they used to do.\\n181. Among those We created is a commu\\ufffenity—they guide by truth, and do justice \\nthereby.\\n61\\n7. THE ELEVATIONS (al-A’raf)\\n182. As for those who reject Our messages, We \\nwill gradually lead them from where they do \\nnot know.\\n183. And I will encourage them. My plan is \\nfirm.\\n184. Do they not think? There is no madness in \\ntheir friend. He is but a plain warner.\\n185. Have they not observed the government of \\nthe heavens and the earth, and all the things \\nthat Allah created, and that their time may \\nhave drawn near? Which message, besides \\nthis, will they believe in?\\n186. Whomever Allah misguides has no guide. \\nAnd He leaves them blundering in their \\ntransgression. \\n187. They ask you about the Hour, “When will \\nit come?” Say, “Knowledge of it rests with my \\nLord. None can reveal its coming except He. \\nIt weighs heavily on the heavens and the \\nearth. It will not come upon you except sud\\ufffedenly.” They ask you as if you are responsible \\nfor it. Say, “Knowledge of it rests with Allah,” \\nbut most people do not know.\\n188. Say, “I have no control over any benefit or \\nharm to myself, except as Allah wills. Had I \\nknown the future, I would have acquired \\nmuch good, and no harm would have \\ntouched me. I am only a warner, and a herald \\nof good news to a people who believe.”\\n189. It is He who created you from a single per\\ufffeson, and made from it its mate, that he may \\nfind comfort with her. Then, when he has \\ncovered her, she conceives a light load, and \\nshe carries it around. But when she has grown \\nheavy, they pray to Allah their Lord, “if You \\ngive us a good child, we will be among the \\nthankful.”\\n190. But when He has given them a good child, \\nthey attribute partners to Him in what He has \\ngiven them. Allah is exalted above what they \\nassociate.\\n191. Do they idolize those who create nothing, \\nand are themselves created?\\n192. And can neither help them, nor help their \\nown selves?\\n193. And if you invite them to guidance, they \\nwill not follow you. It is the same for you, \\nwhether you invite them, or remain silent.\\n194. Those you call upon besides Allah are \\nservants like you. So call upon them, and let \\nthem answer you, if you are truthful.\\n195. Do they have feet with which they walk? \\nOr do they have hands with which they \\nstrike? Or do they have eyes with which they \\nsee? Or do they have ears with which they \\nhear? Say, “Call upon your partners, then plot \\nagainst me, and do not wait.”\\n196. “My Master is Allah, He Who sent down \\nthe Book, and He takes care of the righteous.”\\n197. Those you call upon besides Him cannot \\nhelp you, nor can they help themselves.\\n198. And if you call them to guidance, they will \\nnot hear. And you see them looking at you, \\nyet they do not see.\\n199. Be tolerant, and command decency, and \\navoid the ignorant.\\n200. And when a suggestion from Satan assails \\nyou, take refuge with Allah. He is Hearing \\nand Knowing.\\n201. Those who are righteous—when an im\\ufffepulse from Satan strikes them, they remind \\nthemselves, and immediately see clearly.\\n202. But their brethren lead them relentlessly \\ninto error, and they never stop short.\\n203. If you do not produce a miracle for them, \\nthey say, “Why don’t you improvise one.” \\nSay, “I only follow what is inspired to me \\nfrom my Lord.” These are insights from your \\nLord, and guidance, and mercy, for a people \\nwho believe.\\n204. When the Quran is recited, listen to it, and \\npay attention, so that you may experience \\nmercy.\\n205. And remember your Lord within yourself, \\nhumbly and fearfully, and quietly, in the \\nmorning and the evening, and do not be of \\nthe neglectful.\\n206. Those who are in the presence of your \\nLord are not too proud to worship Him. They \\n62\\n8. THE SPOILS (al-Anfal)\\nrecite His praises, and to Him they bow \\ndown.\\n8. THE SPOILS\\n(al-Anfal)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. They ask you about the bounties. Say, “The \\nbounties are for Allah and the Messenger.” So \\nbe mindful of Allah, and settle your differ\\ufffeences, and obey Allah and His Messenger, if \\nyou are believers.\\n2. The believers are those whose hearts trem\\ufffeble when Allah is mentioned, and when His \\nrevelations are recited to them, they \\nstrengthen them in faith, and upon their Lord \\nthey rely.\\n3. Those who perform the prayer; and from \\nOur provisions to them, they spend.\\n4. These are the true believers. They have high \\nstanding with their Lord, and forgiveness, \\nand a generous provision.\\n5. Even as your Lord brought you out of your \\nhome with the truth, some believers were re\\ufffeluctant.\\n6. Arguing with you about the truth after it \\nwas made clear, as if they were being driven \\nto death as they looked on.\\n7. Allah has promised you one of the two \\ngroups—that it would be yours—but you \\nwanted the unarmed group to be yours. Allah \\nintends to prove the truth with His words, \\nand to uproot the disbelievers.\\n8. In order to confirm the truth and nullify \\nfalsehood, even though the guilty dislike it.\\n9. When you appealed to your Lord for help, \\nHe answered you, “I am reinforcing you with \\none thousand angels in succession.”\\n10. Allah only made it a message of hope, and \\nto set your hearts at rest. Victory comes only \\nfrom Allah. Allah is Mighty and Wise.\\n11. He made drowsiness overcome you, as a se\\ufffecurity from Him. And He sent down upon \\nyou water from the sky, to cleanse you with \\nit, and to rid you of Satan’s pollution, and to \\nfortify your hearts, and to strengthen your \\nfoothold.\\n12. Your Lord inspired the angels: “I am with \\nyou, so support those who believe. I will cast \\nterror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. \\nSo strike above the necks, and strike off every \\nfingertip of theirs.”\\n13. That is because they opposed Allah and His \\nMessenger. Whoever opposes Allah and His \\nMessenger—Allah is severe in retribution.\\n14. “Here it is; so taste it.” For the disbelievers \\nthere is the suffering of the Fire.\\n15. O you who believe! When you meet those \\nwho disbelieve on the march, never turn your \\nbacks on them.\\n16. Anyone who turns his back on them on \\nthat Day, except while maneuvering for bat\\ufffetle, or to join another group, has incurred \\nwrath from Allah, and his abode is Hell—\\nwhat a miserable destination!\\n17. It was not you who killed them, but it was \\nAllah who killed them. And it was not you \\nwho launched when you launched, but it was \\nAllah who launched. That He may bestow \\nupon the believers an excellent reward. Allah \\nis Hearing and Knowing. \\n18. Such is the case. Allah will undermine the \\nstrategy of the disbelievers.\\n19. If you desire a verdict, the verdict has come \\nto you. And if you desist, it would be best for \\nyou. And if you return, We will return; and \\nyour troops, however numerous, will not \\nbenefit you. Allah is with the believers.\\n20. O you who believe! Obey Allah and His \\nMessenger, and do not turn away from him \\nwhen you hear.\\n21. And be not like those who say, “We hear,” \\nwhen they do not hear.\\n22. The worst of animals to Allah are the deaf \\nand dumb—those who do not reason.\\n23. Had Allah recognized any good in them, \\nHe would have made them hear; and had He \\n63\\n8. THE SPOILS (al-Anfal)\\nmade them hear, they would have turned \\naway defiantly.\\n24. O you who believe! Respond to Allah and \\nto the Messenger when He calls you to what \\nwill revive you. And know that Allah stands \\nbetween a man and his heart, and that to Him \\nyou will be gathered.\\n25. And beware of discord which does not af\\ufffeflict the wrongdoers among you exclusively; \\nand know that Allah is severe in retribution.\\n26. And remember when you were few, op\\ufffepressed in the land, fearing that people may \\ncapture you; but He sheltered you, and sup\\ufffeported you with His victory, and provided \\nyou with good things—so that you may be \\nthankful.\\n27. O you who believe! Do not betray Allah \\nand the Messenger, nor betray your trusts, \\nwhile you know.\\n28. And know that your possessions and your \\nchildren are a test, and that Allah possesses \\nan immense reward. \\n29. O you who believe! If you remain con\\ufffescious of Allah, He will give you a criterion, \\nand will remit from you your sins, and will \\nforgive you. Allah is possessor of infinite \\ngrace.\\n30. When the disbelievers plotted against you, \\nto imprison you, or kill you, or expel you. \\nThey planned, and Allah planned, but Allah \\nis the Best of planners.\\n31. And when Our revelations are recited to \\nthem, they say, “We have heard. Had we \\nwanted, we could have said the like of this; \\nthese are nothing but myths of the ancients.”\\n32. And they said, “Our God, if this is the truth \\nfrom You, then rain down on us stones from \\nthe sky, or visit us with a painful affliction.”\\n33. But Allah would not punish them while \\nyou are amongst them. And Allah would not \\npunish them as long as they seek forgiveness.\\n34. Yet why should Allah not punish them, \\nwhen they are turning others away from the \\nSacred Mosque, although they are not its cus\\ufffetodians? Its rightful custodians are the pious; \\nbut most of them do not know.\\n35. Their prayer at the House was nothing but \\nwhistling and clapping—so taste the punish\\ufffement for your blasphemy.\\n36. Those who disbelieve spend their wealth to \\nrepel from Allah’s path. They will spend it, \\nthen it will become a source of sorrow for \\nthem, and then they will be defeated. Those \\nwho disbelieve will be herded into Hell.\\n37. That Allah may distinguish the bad from \\nthe good, and heap the bad on top of one an\\ufffeother, and pile them together, and throw \\nthem in Hell. These are the losers.\\n38. Say to those who disbelieve: if they desist, \\ntheir past will be forgiven. But if they per\\ufffesist—the practice of the ancients has passed \\naway.\\n39. Fight them until there is no more persecu\\ufffetion, and religion becomes exclusively for Al\\ufffelah. But if they desist—Allah is Seeing of what \\nthey do.\\n40. And if they turn away, know that Allah is \\nyour Protector. The Best Protector, and the \\nBest Supporter.\\n41. And know that whatever spoils you gain, to \\nAllah belongs its fifth, and to the Messenger, \\nand the relatives, and the orphans, and the \\npoor, and to the wayfarer, provided you be\\ufffelieve in Allah and in what We revealed to Our \\nservant on the Day of Distinction, the day \\nwhen the two armies met. Allah is Capable of \\neverything.\\n42. Recall when you were on the nearer bank, \\nand they were on the further bank, and the \\ncaravan was below you. Had you planned for \\nthis meeting, you would have disagreed on \\nthe timing, but Allah was to carry out a pre\\ufffedetermined matter, so that those who perish \\nwould perish by clear evidence, and those \\nwho survive would survive by clear evidence. \\nAllah is Hearing and Knowing.\\n43. Allah made them appear in your dream as \\nfew. Had He made them appear as many, you \\nwould have lost heart, and disputed in the \\n64\\n8. THE SPOILS (al-Anfal)\\nmatter. But Allah saved the situation. He \\nknows what the hearts contain.\\n44. When you met, He made them appear as \\nfew in your eyes, and made you appear fewer \\nin their eyes, so that Allah may conclude a \\npredetermined matter. To Allah all matters \\nrevert.\\n45. O you who believe! When you meet a force, \\nstand firm, and remember Allah much, so \\nthat you may prevail.\\n46. And obey Allah and His Messenger, and do \\nnot dispute, lest you falter and lose your \\ncourage. And be steadfast. Allah is with the \\nsteadfast.\\n47. And do not be like those who left their \\nhomes boastfully, showing off before the peo\\ufffeple, and barring others from the path of Al\\ufffelah. Allah comprehends what they do.\\n48. Satan made their deeds appear good to \\nthem, and said, “You cannot be defeated by \\nany people today, and I am at your side.” But \\nwhen the two armies came in sight of one an\\ufffeother, he turned on his heels, and said, “I am \\ninnocent of you; I see what you do not see; I \\nfear Allah; Allah is severe in punishment.”\\n49. The hypocrites and those in whose hearts \\nis sickness said, “Their religion has deluded \\nthese people.” But whoever puts his trust in \\nAllah—Allah is Mighty and Wise.\\n50. If only you could see, as the angels take \\naway those who disbelieve, striking their \\nfaces and their backs: “Taste the agony of the \\nBurning.”\\n51. “That is because of what your hands have \\ncommitted, and because Allah is not unjust \\nto the servants.”\\n52. Like the behavior of the people of Pharaoh, \\nand those before them. They rejected the \\nsigns of Allah, so Allah seized them for their \\nsins. Allah is Powerful, Severe in punishment.\\n53. That is because Allah would never change \\na blessing He has bestowed on a people unless \\nthey change what is within themselves, and \\nbecause Allah is Hearing and Knowing.\\n54. Such was the case with the people of Phar\\ufffeaoh, and those before them. They denied the \\nsigns of their Lord, so We annihilated them \\nfor their wrongs, and We drowned the people \\nof Pharaoh—they were all evildoers.\\n55. The worst of creatures in Allah's view are \\nthose who disbelieve. They have no faith.\\n56. Those of them with whom you made a \\ntreaty, but they violate their agreement every \\ntime. They are not righteous.\\n57. If you confront them in battle, make of \\nthem a fearsome example for those who fol\\ufffelow them, that they may take heed.\\n58. If you fear treachery on the part of a people, \\nbreak off with them in a like manner. Allah \\ndoes not like the treacherous.\\n59. Let not the disbelievers assume that they \\nare ahead. They will not escape.\\n60. And prepare against them all the power \\nyou can muster, and all the cavalry you can \\nmobilize, to terrify thereby Allah’s enemies \\nand your enemies, and others besides them \\nwhom you do not know, but Allah knows \\nthem. Whatever you spend in Allah’s way will \\nbe repaid to you in full, and you will not be \\nwronged.\\n61. But if they incline towards peace, then in\\ufffecline towards it, and put your trust in Allah. \\nHe is the Hearer, the Knower.\\n62. If they intend to deceive you—Allah is suf\\ufffeficient for you. It is He who supported you \\nwith His aid, and with the believers.\\n63. And He united their hearts. Had you spent \\neverything on earth, you would not have \\nunited their hearts, but Allah united them to\\ufffegether. He is Mighty and Wise.\\n64. O prophet! Count on Allah, and on the be\\ufffelievers who have followed you.\\n65. O prophet! Rouse the believers to battle. If \\nthere are twenty steadfast among you, they \\nwill defeat two hundred; and if there are a \\nhundred of you, they will defeat a thousand \\nof those who disbelieve; because they are a \\npeople who do not understand.\\n65\\n9. REPENTANCE (at-Tawbah)\\n66. Allah has now lightened your burden, \\nknowing that there is weakness in you. If \\nthere are a hundred steadfast among you, \\nthey will defeat two hundred; and if there are \\na thousand of you, they will defeat two thou\\ufffesand by Allah’s leave. Allah is with the stead\\ufffefast.\\n67. It is not for a prophet to take prisoners be\\ufffefore he has subdued the land. You desire the \\nmaterials of this world, but Allah desires the \\nHereafter. Allah is Strong and Wise.\\n68. Were it not for a predetermined decree \\nfrom Allah, an awful punishment would have \\nafflicted you for what you have taken.\\n69. So consume what you have gained, legiti\\ufffemate and wholesome; and remain conscious \\nof Allah. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.\\n70. O prophet! Say to those you hold prisoners, \\n“If Allah finds any good in your hearts, He \\nwill give you better than what was taken from \\nyou, and He will forgive you. Allah is Forgiv\\ufffeing and Merciful.”\\n71. But if they intend to betray you, they have \\nalready betrayed Allah, and He has overpow\\ufffeered them. Allah is Knowing and Wise.\\n72. Those who believed, and emigrated, and \\nstruggled in Allah’s cause with their posses\\ufffesions and their persons, and those who pro\\ufffevided shelter and support—these are allies of \\none another. As for those who believed, but \\ndid not emigrate, you owe them no protec\\ufffetion, until they have emigrated. But if they \\nask you for help in religion, you must come \\nto their aid, except against a people with \\nwhom you have a treaty. Allah is Seeing of \\nwhat you do.\\n73. As for those who disbelieve, they are allies \\nof one another. Unless you do this, there will \\nbe turmoil in the land, and much corruption.\\n74. Those who believed, and emigrated, and \\nstruggled for Allah’s cause, and those who \\ngave shelter and support—these are the true \\nbelievers. They will have forgiveness, and a \\nbountiful provision.\\n75. As for those who believed afterwards, and \\nemigrated and struggled with you—these be\\ufffelong with you. But family members are \\nnearer to one another in the Book of Allah. \\nAllah is Cognizant of everything.\\n9. REPENTANCE\\n(at-Tawbah)\\n1. A declaration of immunity from Allah and \\nHis Messenger to the polytheists with whom \\nyou had made a treaty. \\n2. So travel the land for four months, and \\nknow that you cannot escape Allah, and that \\nAllah will disgrace the disbelievers.\\n3. And a proclamation from Allah and His \\nMessenger to the people on the day of the \\nGreater Pilgrimage, that Allah has disowned \\nthe polytheists, and so did His Messenger. If \\nyou repent, it will be better for you. But if you \\nturn away, know that you cannot escape Al\\ufffelah. And announce to those who disbelieve a \\npainful punishment.\\n4. Except for those among the polytheists with \\nwhom you had made a treaty, and did not vi\\ufffeolate any of its terms, nor aided anyone \\nagainst you. So fulfill the treaty with them to \\nthe end of its term. Allah loves the righteous.\\n5. When the Sacred Months have passed, kill \\nthe polytheists wherever you find them. And \\ncapture them, and besiege them, and lie in \\nwait for them at every ambush. But if they re\\ufffepent, and perform the prayers, and pay the \\nalms, then let them go their way. Allah is \\nMost Forgiving, Most Merciful.\\n6. And if anyone of the polytheists asks you for \\nprotection, give him protection so that he \\nmay hear the Word of Allah; then escort him \\nto his place of safety. That is because they are \\na people who do not know.\\n7. How can there be a treaty with the polythe\\ufffeists on the part of Allah and His Messenger, \\nexcept for those with whom you made a \\ntreaty at the Sacred Mosque? As long as they \\nare upright with you, be upright with them. \\nAllah loves the pious.\\n66\\n9. REPENTANCE (at-Tawbah)\\n8. How? Whenever they overcome you, they \\nrespect neither kinship nor treaty with you. \\nThey satisfy you with lip service, but their \\nhearts refuse, and most of them are immoral.\\n9. They traded away Allah's revelations for a \\ncheap price, so they barred others from His \\npath. How evil is what they did.\\n10. Towards a believer they respect neither \\nkinship nor treaty. These are the transgres\\ufffesors.\\n11. But if they repent, and perform the prayers, \\nand give the obligatory charity, then they are \\nyour brethren in faith. We detail the revela\\ufffetions for a people who know.\\n12. But if they violate their oaths after their \\npledge, and attack your religion, then fight \\nthe leaders of disbelief—they have no faith—\\nso that they may desist.\\n13. Will you not fight a people who violated \\ntheir oaths, and planned to exile the Messen\\ufffeger, and initiated hostilities against you? Do \\nyou fear them? It is Allah you should fear, if \\nyou are believers.\\n14. Fight them. Allah will punish them at your \\nhands, and humiliate them, and help you \\nagainst them, and heal the hearts of a believ\\ufffeing people.\\n15. And He will remove the anger of their \\nhearts. Allah redeems whomever He wills. \\nAllah is Knowledgeable and Wise.\\n16. Or do you think that you will be left alone, \\nwithout Allah identifying which of you will \\nstrive, and take no supporters apart from Al\\ufffelah, His Messenger, and the believers? Allah \\nis well Aware of what you do.\\n17. It is not for the polytheists to attend Allah’s \\nplaces of worship while professing their dis\\ufffebelief. These—their works are in vain, and in \\nthe Fire they will abide.\\n18. The only people to attend Allah’s places of \\nworship are those who believe in Allah and \\nthe Last Day, and pray regularly, and practice \\nregular charity, and fear none but Allah. \\nThese are most likely to be guided.\\n19. Do you consider giving water to pilgrims \\nand maintaining the Sacred Mosque the same \\nas believing in Allah and the Last Day and \\nstriving in Allah’s path? They are not equal in \\nAllah’s sight. Allah does not guide the unjust \\npeople.\\n20. Those who believe, and emigrate, and \\nstrive in Allah’s path with their possessions \\nand their persons, are of a higher rank with \\nAllah. These are the winners.\\n21. Their Lord announces to them good news \\nof mercy from Him, and acceptance, and gar\\ufffedens wherein they will have lasting bliss.\\n22. Abiding therein forever. With Allah is a \\ngreat reward.\\n23. O you who believe! Do not ally yourselves \\nwith your parents and your siblings if they \\nprefer disbelief to belief. Whoever of you al\\ufffelies himself with them—these are the wrong\\ufffedoers.\\n24. Say, “If your parents, and your children, \\nand your siblings, and your spouses, and your \\nrelatives, and the wealth you have acquired, \\nand a business you worry about, and homes \\nyou love, are more dear to you than Allah, \\nand His Messenger, and the struggle in His \\ncause, then wait until Allah executes His \\njudgment.” Allah does not guide the sinful \\npeople.\\n25. Allah has given you victory in numerous \\nregions; but on the day of Hunayn, your great \\nnumber impressed you, but it availed you \\nnothing; and the land, as spacious as it was, \\nnarrowed for you; and you turned your backs \\nin retreat.\\n26. Then Allah sent down His serenity upon \\nHis Messenger, and upon the believers; and \\nHe sent down troops you did not see; and He \\npunished those who disbelieved. Such is the \\nrecompense of the disbelievers.\\n27. Then, after that, Allah will relent towards \\nwhomever He wills. Allah is Forgiving and \\nMerciful.\\n28. O you who believe! The polytheists are pol\\ufffeluted, so let them not approach the Sacred \\nMosque after this year of theirs. And if you \\n67\\n9. REPENTANCE (at-Tawbah)\\nfear poverty, Allah will enrich you from His \\ngrace, if He wills. Allah is Aware and Wise.\\n29. Fight those who do not believe in Allah, \\nnor in the Last Day, nor forbid what Allah \\nand His Messenger have forbidden, nor abide \\nby the religion of truth—from among those \\nwho received the Scripture—until they pay \\nthe due tax, willingly or unwillingly.\\n30. The Jews said, “Ezra is the son of Allah,” \\nand the Christians said, “The Messiah is the \\nson of Allah.” These are their statements, out \\nof their mouths. They emulate the statements \\nof those who blasphemed before. May Allah \\nassail them! How deceived they are!\\n31. They have taken their rabbis and their \\npriests as lords instead of Allah, as well as the \\nMessiah son of Mary. Although they were \\ncommanded to worship none but The One \\nGod. There is no god except He. Glory be to \\nHim; High above what they associate with \\nHim.\\n32. They want to extinguish Allah’s light with \\ntheir mouths, but Allah refuses except to \\ncomplete His light, even though the disbe\\ufffelievers dislike it.\\n33. It is He who sent His Messenger with the \\nguidance and the religion of truth, in order to \\nmake it prevail over all religions, even though \\nthe idolaters dislike it.\\n34. O you who believe! Many of the rabbis and \\npriests consume people's wealth illicitly, and \\nhinder from Allah’s path. Those who hoard \\ngold and silver, and do not spend them in Al\\ufffelah’s cause, inform them of a painful punish\\ufffement.\\n35. On the Day when they will be heated in the \\nFire of Hell, then their foreheads, and their \\nsides, and their backs will be branded with \\nthem: “This is what you hoarded for your\\ufffeselves; so taste what you used to hoard.”\\n36. The number of months, according to Al\\ufffelah, is twelve months—in the decree of Al\\ufffelah—since the Day He created the heavens \\nand the earth, of which four are sacred. This \\nis the correct religion. So do not wrong your\\ufffeselves during them. And fight the polytheists \\ncollectively, as they fight you collectively, and \\nknow that Allah is with the righteous.\\n37. Postponement is an increase in disbelief—\\nby which those who disbelieve are led astray. \\nThey allow it one year, and forbid it another \\nyear, in order to conform to the number \\nmade sacred by Allah, thus permitting what \\nAllah has forbidden. The evil of their deeds \\nseems good to them. Allah does not guide the \\ndisbelieving people.\\n38. O you who believe! What is the matter with \\nyou, when it is said to you, “Mobilize in the \\ncause of Allah,” you cling heavily to the \\nearth? Do you prefer the present life to the \\nHereafter? The enjoyment of the present life, \\ncompared to the Hereafter, is only a little.\\n39. Unless you mobilize, He will punish you \\nmost painfully, and will replace you with an\\ufffeother people, and you will not harm Him at \\nall. Allah has power over all things.\\n40. If you do not help him, Allah has already\\nhelped him, when those who disbelieved ex\\ufffepelled him, and he was the second of two in \\nthe cave. He said to his friend, “Do not worry, \\nAllah is with us.” And Allah made His tran\\ufffequility descend upon him, and supported \\nhim with forces you did not see, and made the \\nword of those who disbelieved the lowest, \\nwhile the Word of Allah is the Highest. Allah \\nis Mighty and Wise.\\n41. Mobilize, light or heavy, and strive with \\nyour possessions and your lives in the cause \\nof Allah. That is better for you, if you only \\nknew.\\n42. Had the gain been immediate, and the \\njourney shorter, they would have followed \\nyou; but the distance seemed too long for \\nthem. Still they swear by Allah: “Had we been \\nable, we would have marched out with you.” \\nThey damn their own souls, and Allah knows \\nthat they are lying.\\n43. May Allah pardon you! Why did you give \\nthem permission before it became clear to \\nyou who are the truthful ones, and who are \\nthe liars?\\n68\\n9. REPENTANCE (at-Tawbah)\\n44. Those who believe in Allah and the Last \\nDay do not ask you for exemption from striv\\ufffeing with their possessions and their lives. Al\\ufffelah is fully aware of the righteous.\\n45. Only those who do not believe in Allah and \\nthe Last Day ask you for exemption. Their \\nhearts are full of doubts, so they waver in \\ntheir doubts.\\n46. Had they wanted to mobilize, they would \\nhave made preparations for it; but Allah dis\\ufffeliked their participation, so he held them \\nback, and it was said, “Stay behind with those \\nwho stay behind.”\\n47. Had they mobilized with you, they would \\nhave added only to your difficulties, and they \\nwould have spread rumors in your midst, try\\ufffeing to sow discord among you. Some of you \\nare avid listeners to them. Allah is Aware of \\nthe wrongdoers.\\n48. They tried to cause conflict before, and \\nthey hatched plots against you, until the truth \\nprevailed, and the command of Allah became \\nevident—in spite of their dislike.\\n49. Among them is he who says, “Excuse me, \\nand do not trouble me.” In fact, they sunk \\ninto trouble. In fact, Hell will engulf the dis\\ufffebelievers.\\n50. If something good happens to you, it up\\ufffesets them; and if a calamity befalls you, they \\nsay, “We took our precautions in advance,” \\nand they depart, happy.\\n51. Say, “Nothing will happen to us except \\nwhat Allah has ordained for us; He is our Pro\\ufffetector.” In Allah let the faithful put their trust.\\n52. Say, “Are you expecting for us anything \\nother than one of the two excellences? As for \\nus: we are expecting that Allah will afflict you \\nwith a punishment from Himself, or at our \\nhands. So wait, we are waiting with you.”\\n53. Say, “Whether you spend willingly or un\\ufffewillingly, it will not be accepted from you. \\nYou are evil people.”\\n54. What prevents the acceptance of their con\\ufffetributions is nothing but the fact that they \\ndisbelieved in Allah and His Messenger, and \\nthat they do not approach the prayer except \\nlazily, and that they do not spend except \\ngrudgingly.\\n55. Let neither their possessions nor their chil\\ufffedren impress you. Allah intends to torment \\nthem through them in this worldly life, and \\nthat their souls depart while they are disbe\\ufffelievers.\\n56. They swear by Allah that they are of you. \\nBut they are not of you. They are divisive peo\\ufffeple.\\n57. Were they to find a shelter, or a cave, or a \\nhideout, they would go to it, rushing.\\n58. And among them are those who criticize \\nyou in regard to charities. If they are given \\nsome of it, they become pleased; but if they \\nare not given any, they grow resentful.\\n59. If only they were content with what Allah \\nand His Messenger have given them, and \\nsaid, “Allah is sufficient for us; Allah will give \\nus of His bounty, and so will His Messenger; \\nto Allah we eagerly turn.”\\n60. Charities are for the poor, and the desti\\ufffetute, and those who administer them, and for \\nreconciling hearts, and for freeing slaves, and \\nfor those in debt, and in the path of Allah, and \\nfor the traveler in need—an obligation from \\nAllah. Allah is All-Knowing, Most Wise.\\n61. And among them are those who insult the \\nProphet, and say, “He is all ears.” Say, “He lis\\ufffetens for your own good. He believes in Allah, \\nand trusts the believers, and is mercy for \\nthose of you who believe.” Those who insult \\nthe Messenger of Allah will have a painful \\npenalty.\\n62. They swear to you by Allah to please you. \\nBut it is more proper for them to please Allah \\nand His Messenger, if they are believers.\\n63. Do they not know that whoever opposes \\nAllah and His Messenger, will have the Fire \\nof Hell, abiding in it forever? That is the su\\ufffepreme disgrace.\\n64. The hypocrites worry lest a chapter may be \\nrevealed about them, informing them of what \\n69\\n9. REPENTANCE (at-Tawbah)\\nis in their hearts. Say, “Go on mocking; Allah \\nwill bring out what you fear.”\\n65. If you ask them, they will say, “We were \\njust joking and playing.” Say, “Were you \\nmaking jokes about Allah, His revelations, \\nand His Messenger?”\\n66. Do not apologize. You have disbelieved af\\ufffeter your belief. If We pardon some of you, We \\nwill punish others, because they are guilty.\\n67. The hypocrite men and hypocrite women \\nare of one another. They advocate evil, and \\nprohibit righteousness, and withhold their \\nhands. They forgot Allah, so He forgot them. \\nThe hypocrites are the sinners.\\n68. Allah has promised the hypocrite men and \\nhypocrite women, and the disbelievers, the \\nFire of Hell, abiding therein forever. It is their \\ndue. And Allah has cursed them. They will \\nhave a lasting punishment.\\n69. Like those before you. They were more \\npowerful than you, and had more wealth and \\nchildren. They enjoyed their share, and you \\nenjoyed your share, as those before you en\\ufffejoyed their share. And you indulged, as they \\nindulged. It is they whose works will fail in \\nthis world and in the Hereafter. It is they who \\nare the losers.\\n70. Have they not heard the stories of those be\\ufffefore them? The people of Noah, and Aad, and \\nThamood; and the people of Abraham, and \\nthe inhabitants of Median, and the Over\\ufffeturned Cities? Their messengers came to \\nthem with the clear proofs. Allah never \\nwronged them, but they used to wrong their \\nown selves.\\n71. The believing men and believing women \\nare friends of one another. They advocate vir\\ufffetue, forbid evil, perform the prayers, practice \\ncharity, and obey Allah and His Messenger. \\nThese—Allah will have mercy on them. Allah \\nis Noble and Wise.\\n72. Allah promises the believers, men and \\nwomen, gardens beneath which rivers flow, \\nabiding therein forever, and fine homes in \\nthe Gardens of Eden. But approval from Al\\ufffelah is even greater. That is the supreme \\nachievement.\\n73. O Prophet! Strive against the disbelievers \\nand the hypocrites, and be stern with them. \\nTheir abode is Hell—what a miserable desti\\ufffenation!\\n74. They swear by Allah that they said nothing; \\nbut they did utter the word of blasphemy, and \\nthey renounced faith after their submission. \\nAnd they plotted what they could not attain. \\nThey were resentful only because Allah and \\nHis Messenger have enriched them out of His \\ngrace. If they repent, it would be best for \\nthem; but if they turn away, Allah will afflict \\nthem with a painful punishment—in this life \\nand in the Hereafter—and they will have on \\nearth no protector and no savior.\\n75. Among them are those who promised Al\\ufffelah: “If He gives us of His bounty, we will do\\ufffenate and be among the upright.”\\n76. But when He has given them of His bounty, \\nthey became stingy with it, and turned away \\nin aversion.\\n77. So He penalized them with hypocrisy in \\ntheir hearts, until the Day they face Him—be\\ufffecause they broke their promise to Allah, and \\nbecause they used to lie.\\n78. Do they not know that Allah knows their \\nsecrets and their conspiracies? And that Allah \\nis the Knower of the unseen?\\n79. Those who criticize the believers who give \\ncharity voluntarily, and ridicule those who \\nfind nothing to give except their own ef\\ufffeforts—Allah ridicules them. They will have a \\npainful punishment.\\n80. Whether you ask forgiveness for them, or \\ndo not ask forgiveness for them—even if you \\nask forgiveness for them seventy times, Allah \\nwill not forgive them. That is because they \\ndisbelieved in Allah and His Messenger. Al\\ufffelah does not guide the immoral people.\\n81. Those who stayed behind rejoiced at their \\nstaying behind the Messenger of Allah. And \\nthey hated to strive with their wealth and \\ntheir lives in Allah’s way. And they said, “Do \\n70\\n9. REPENTANCE (at-Tawbah)\\nnot venture out in the heat.” Say, “The Fire of \\nHell is much hotter, if they only understood.”\\n82. Let them laugh a little, and weep much; in \\nrecompense for what they used to earn.\\n83. If Allah brings you back to a party of them, \\nand they ask your permission to go out, say, \\n“You will not go out with me, ever, nor will \\nyou ever fight an enemy with me. You were \\ncontent to sit back the first time, so sit back \\nwith those who stay behind.”\\n84. You are never to pray over anyone of them \\nwho dies, nor are you to stand at his grave\\ufffeside. They rejected Allah and His Messenger, \\nand died while they were sinners.\\n85. Do not let their possessions and their chil\\ufffedren impress you. Allah desires to torment \\nthem through them in this world, and their \\nsouls expire while they are disbelievers.\\n86. When a chapter is revealed, stating: “Be\\ufffelieve in Allah and strive with His Messenger,” \\nthe prominent among them ask you for ex\\ufffeemption. They say, “Allow us to stay with \\nthose who stay behind.”\\n87. They prefer to be with those who stay be\\ufffehind. Their hearts were sealed, so they do not \\nunderstand.\\n88. But the Messenger and those who believe \\nwith him struggle with their possessions and \\ntheir lives. These have deserved the good \\nthings. These are the successful.\\n89. Allah has prepared for them gardens be\\ufffeneath which rivers flow, wherein they will \\nabide forever. That is the great victory.\\n90. Some of the Desert-Arabs came to make \\nexcuses, asking to be granted exemption, \\nwhile those who were untrue to Allah and His \\nMessenger stayed behind. A painful punish\\ufffement will afflict those among them who dis\\ufffebelieved.\\n91. There is no blame on the weak, nor on the \\nsick, nor on those who have nothing to give, \\nprovided they are true to Allah and His Mes\\ufffesenger. In no way can the righteous be \\nblamed. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.\\n92. Nor on those who approach you, wishing \\nto ride with you, and you said, “I have noth\\ufffeing to carry you on.” So they went away, with \\ntheir eyes overflowing with tears, sorrowing \\nfor not finding the means to spend.\\n93. But blame is on those who ask you for ex\\ufffeemption, although they are rich. They are \\ncontent to be with those who stay behind. Al\\ufffelah has sealed their hearts, so they do not \\nknow.\\n94. They present excuses to you when you re\\ufffeturn to them. Say, “Do not offer excuses; we \\ndo not trust you; Allah has informed us of \\nyou. And Allah will watch your actions, and \\nso will the Messenger; then you will be re\\ufffeturned to the Knower of the Invisible and the \\nVisible, and He will inform you of what you \\nused to do.”\\n95. They will swear to you by Allah, when you \\nreturn to them, that you may leave them \\nalone. So leave them alone. They are a dis\\ufffegrace, and their destiny is Hell; a reward for \\nwhat they used to earn.\\n96. They will swear to you that you may accept \\nthem. But even if you accept them, Allah does \\nnot accept the wicked people.\\n97. The Desert-Arabs are the most steeped in \\ndisbelief and hypocrisy, and the most likely to \\nignore the limits that Allah revealed to His \\nMessenger. Allah is Knowing and Wise.\\n98. And among the Desert-Arabs are those \\nwho consider their contribution to be a fine. \\nAnd they wait for a reversal of your fortunes. \\nUpon them will fall the cycle of misfortune. \\nAllah is Hearing and Knowing.\\n99. Yet among the Desert-Arabs are those who \\nbelieve in Allah and the Last Day, and con\\ufffesider their contribution to be a means to\\ufffewards Allah, and the prayers of the Messen\\ufffeger. Surely it will draw them closer, and Allah \\nwill admit them into His mercy. Allah is For\\ufffegiving and Compassionate.\\n100. The Pioneers—The first of the Migrants \\nand the Supporters, and those who followed \\nthem in righteousness. Allah is pleased with \\nthem, and they are pleased with Him. He has \\n71\\n9. REPENTANCE (at-Tawbah)\\nprepared for them Gardens beneath which \\nrivers flow, where they will abide forever. \\nThat is the sublime triumph.\\n101. Among the Desert-Arabs around you \\nthere are some hypocrites, and among the in\\ufffehabitants of Medina too. They have become \\nadamant in hypocrisy. You do not know \\nthem, but We know them. We will punish \\nthem twice; then they will be returned to a se\\ufffevere torment.\\n102. Others have confessed their sins, having \\nmixed good deeds with bad deeds. Perhaps \\nAllah will redeem them. Allah is Forgiving \\nand Merciful.\\n103. Receive contributions from their wealth, \\nto purify them and sanctify them with it; and \\npray for them. Your prayer is comfort for \\nthem. Allah is Hearing and Knowing.\\n104. Do they not know that Allah accepts the \\nrepentance of His servants, and that He re\\ufffeceives the contributions, and that Allah is the \\nAcceptor of Repentance, the Merciful?\\n105. Say, “Work. Allah will see your work, and \\nso will His Messenger, and the believers. \\nThen you will be returned to the Knower of \\nsecrets and declarations, and He will inform \\nyou of what you used to do.”\\n106. Others are held in suspense, awaiting Al\\ufffelah’s decree, as to whether He will punish \\nthem, or accept their repentance. Allah is \\nAware and Wise.\\n107. Then there are those who establish a \\nmosque to cause harm, and disbelief, and dis\\ufffeunity among the believers, and as an outpost \\nfor those who fight Allah and His Messenger. \\nThey will swear: “Our intentions are nothing \\nbut good.” But Allah bears witness that they \\nare liars.\\n108. Do not stand in it, ever. A mosque \\nfounded upon piety from the first day is wor\\ufffethier of your standing in it. In it are men who \\nlove to be purified. Allah loves those who pu\\uffferify themselves.\\n109. Is he who founds his structure upon piety \\nand acceptance from Allah better, or he who \\nfounds his structure on the brink of a cliff \\nthat is about to tumble, so it tumbles with \\nhim into the Fire of Hell? Allah does not \\nguide the unjust people.\\n110. The structure which they built will remain \\nquestionable in their hearts, until their hearts \\nare stopped. Allah is Knowing and Wise.\\n111. Allah has purchased from the believers \\ntheir lives and their properties in exchange \\nfor Paradise. They fight in Allah’s way, and \\nthey kill and get killed. It is a promise binding \\non Him in the Torah, and the Gospel, and the \\nQuran. And who is more true to his promise \\nthan Allah? So rejoice in making such an ex\\ufffechange—that is the supreme triumph.\\n112. Those who repent, those who worship, \\nthose who praise, those who journey, those \\nwho kneel, those who bow down, those who \\nadvocate righteousness and forbid evil, and \\nthose who keep Allah’s limits—give good \\nnews to the believers.\\n113. It is not for the Prophet and those who be\\ufffelieve to ask forgiveness for the polytheists, \\neven if they are near relatives, after it has be\\ufffecome clear to them that they are people of \\nHellfire.\\n114. Abraham asked forgiveness for his father \\nonly because of a promise he had made to \\nhim. But when it became clear to him that he \\nwas an enemy of Allah, he disowned him. \\nAbraham was kind and clement.\\n115. Allah would never lead a people astray, af\\ufffeter He had guided them, until He makes clear \\nto them what they should guard against. Al\\ufffelah has knowledge of all things.\\n116. To Allah belongs the dominion of the \\nheavens and the earth. He gives life, and He \\ncauses death. And besides Allah, you have \\nneither protector, nor supporter.\\n117. Allah has redeemed the Prophet, and the \\nEmigrants, and the Supporters—those who \\nfollowed him in the hour of difficulty—after \\nthe hearts of some of them almost swerved. \\nThen He pardoned them. He is Kind towards \\nthem, Compassionate.\\n118. Also towards the three who were left be\\ufffehind. Then, when the earth, as vast as it is, \\n72\\n10. JONAH (Yunus)\\nclosed in on them, and their very souls closed \\nin on them, and they realized that there was \\nno refuge from Allah, except in Him, He re\\ufffedeemed them, so that they may repent. Allah \\nis the Redeemer, the Merciful.\\n119. O you who believe! Be conscious of Allah, \\nand be with the sincere.\\n120. It is not for the inhabitants of Medina and \\nthe Desert-Arabs around them to stay behind \\nthe Messenger of Allah, nor to prefer them\\ufffeselves to him. That is because they never suf\\ufffefer any thirst, nor fatigue, nor hunger in the \\ncause of Allah, nor do they take one step that \\nenrages the disbelievers, nor do they gain an\\ufffeything from an enemy, but it is recorded to \\ntheir credit as a righteous deed. Allah does \\nnot waste the reward of the righteous.\\n121. Nor do they spend any expenditure, small \\nor large, nor do they cross any valley, but it is \\nrecorded to their credit. That Allah may re\\ufffeward them in accordance with the best of \\ntheir deeds.\\n122. It is not advisable for the believers to \\nmarch out altogether. Of every division that \\nmarches out, let a group remain behind, to \\ngain understanding of the religion, and to no\\ufffetify their people when they have returned to \\nthem, that they may beware.\\n123. O you who believe! Fight those of the dis\\ufffebelievers who attack you, and let them find \\nseverity in you, and know that Allah is with \\nthe righteous.\\n124. Whenever a chapter is revealed, some of \\nthem say, “Which of you has this increased in \\nfaith?” As for those who believe: it increases \\nthem in faith, and they rejoice.\\n125. But as for those in whose hearts is sick\\ufffeness: it adds disgrace to their disgrace, and \\nthey die as unbelievers.\\n126. Do they not see that they are tested once \\nor twice every year? Yet they do not repent, \\nand they do not learn. \\n127. And whenever a chapter is revealed, they \\nlook at one another, “Does anyone see you?” \\nThen they slip away. Allah has diverted their \\nhearts, because they are a people who do not \\nunderstand.\\n128. There has come to you a messenger from \\namong yourselves, concerned over your suf\\ufffefering, anxious over you. Towards the believ\\ufffeers, he is compassionate and merciful.\\n129. If they turn away, say, “Allah is enough for \\nme; there is no god except He; in Him I have \\nput my trust; He is the Lord of the Sublime \\nThrone.”\\n10. JONAH\\n(Yunus)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Alif, Lam, Ra. These are the Verses of the \\nWise Book.\\n2. Is it a wonder to the people that We inspired \\na man from among them: “Warn mankind, \\nand give good news to those who believe that \\nthey are on a sound footing with their Lord”? \\nThe disbelievers said, “This is a manifest sor\\ufffecerer.”\\n3. Your Lord is Allah, who created the heavens \\nand the earth in six days, then settled over the \\nThrone, governing all things. There is no in\\ufffetercessor except after His permission. Such is \\nAllah, your Lord—so serve Him. Will you not \\nreflect?\\n4. To Him is your return, altogether. The \\npromise of Allah is true. He originates crea\\ufffetion, and then He repeats it, to reward those \\nwho believe and do good deeds with equity. \\nAs for those who disbelieve, for them is a \\ndrink of boiling water, and agonizing tor\\ufffement, on account of their disbelief.\\n5. It is He who made the sun radiant, and the \\nmoon a light, and determined phases for it—\\nthat you may know the number of years and \\nthe calculation. Allah did not create all this \\nexcept with truth. He details the revelations \\nfor a people who know.\\n73\\n10. JONAH (Yunus)\\n6. In the alternation of night and day, and in \\nwhat Allah created in the heavens and the \\nearth, are signs for people who are aware.\\n7. Those who do not hope to meet Us, and are \\ncontent with the worldly life, and are at ease \\nin it, and those who pay no heed to Our signs.\\n8. These—their dwelling is the Fire—on ac\\ufffecount of what they used to do.\\n9. As for those who believe and do good deeds, \\ntheir Lord guides them in their faith. Rivers \\nwill flow beneath them in the Gardens of \\nBliss.\\n10. Their call therein is, “Glory be to You, our \\nGod.” And their greeting therein is, “Peace.” \\nAnd the last of their call is, “Praise be to Al\\ufffelah, Lord of the Worlds.”\\n11. If Allah were to accelerate the ill for the \\npeople, as they wish to accelerate the good, \\ntheir term would have been fulfilled. But We \\nleave those who do not expect Our encounter \\nto blunder in their excesses.\\n12. Whenever adversity touches the human \\nbeing, he prays to Us—reclining on his side, \\nor sitting, or standing. But when We have re\\ufffelieved his adversity from him, he goes away, \\nas though he had never called on Us for trou\\ufffeble that had afflicted him. Thus the deeds of \\nthe transgressors appear good to them.\\n13. We destroyed generations before you when \\nthey did wrong. Their messengers came to \\nthem with clear signs, but they would not be\\ufffelieve. Thus We requite the sinful people.\\n14. Then We made you successors on earth af\\ufffeter them, to see how you would behave.\\n15. And when Our clear revelations are recited \\nto them, those who do not hope to meet Us \\nsay, “Bring a Quran other than this, or change \\nit.” Say, “It is not for me to change it of my \\nown accord. I only follow what is revealed to \\nme. I fear, if I disobeyed my Lord, the tor\\ufffement of a terrible Day.”\\n16. Say, “Had Allah willed, I would not have \\nrecited it to you, and He would not have \\nmade it known to you. I have lived among \\nyou for a lifetime before it. Do you not un\\ufffederstand?”\\n17. Who does greater wrong than someone \\nwho fabricates lies about Allah, or denies His \\nrevelations? The guilty will never prosper.\\n18. And they worship, besides Allah, what nei\\ufffether harms them nor benefits them. And they \\nsay, “These are our intercessors with Allah.” \\nSay, “Are you informing Allah about what He \\ndoes not know in the heavens or on earth?” \\nGlorified be He, High above the associations \\nthey make.\\n19. Mankind was a single community; then \\nthey differed. Were it not for a prior decree \\nfrom your Lord, the matters over which they \\nhad disputed would have been settled.\\n20. And they say, “If only a miracle was sent \\ndown to him from his Lord.” Say, “The realm \\nof the unseen belongs to Allah; so wait, I am \\nwaiting with you.”\\n21. When We make the people taste mercy af\\ufffeter some adversity has touched them, they \\nbegin to scheme against Our revelations. Say, \\n“Allah is swifter in scheming.” Our envoys \\nare writing down what you scheme.\\n22. It is He who transports you across land and \\nsea. Until, when you are on ships, sailing in a \\nfavorable wind, and rejoicing in it, a raging \\nwind arrives. The waves surge over them \\nfrom every side, and they realize that they are \\nbesieged. Thereupon they pray to Allah, pro\\ufffefessing sincere devotion to Him: “If You save \\nus from this, we will be among the apprecia\\ufffetive.”\\n23. But then, when He has saved them, they \\ncommit violations on earth, and oppose jus\\ufffetice. O people! Your violations are against \\nyour own souls. It is the enjoyment of the \\npresent life. Then to Us is your return, and \\nWe will inform you of what you used to do.\\n24. The likeness of the present life is this: water \\nthat We send down from the sky is absorbed \\nby the plants of the earth, from which the \\npeople and the animals eat. Until, when the \\nearth puts on its fine appearance, and is beau\\ufffetified, and its inhabitants think that they have \\n74\\n10. JONAH (Yunus)\\nmastered it, Our command descends upon it \\nby night or by day, and We turn it into stub\\ufffeble, as if it had not flourished the day before. \\nWe thus clarify the revelations for people \\nwho reflect.\\n25. Allah invites to the Home of Peace, and \\nguides whomever He wills to a straight path.\\n26. For those who have done good is goodness, \\nand more. Neither gloom nor shame will \\ncome over their faces. These are the inhabit\\ufffeants of Paradise, abiding therein forever.\\n27. As for those who have earned evil deeds: a \\nreward of similar evil, and shame will cover \\nthem. They will have no defense against Al\\ufffelah—as if their faces are covered with dark \\npatches of night. These are the inmates of the \\nFire, abiding therein forever.\\n28. On the Day when We will gather them al\\ufffetogether, then say to those who ascribed part\\ufffeners, “To your place, you and your partners.” \\nThen We will separate between them, and \\ntheir partners will say, “It was not us you were \\nworshiping.”\\n29. “Allah is sufficient witness between us and \\nyou. We were unaware of your worshiping \\nus.”\\n30. There, every soul will experience what it \\nhad done previously; and they will be re\\ufffeturned to Allah, their True Master; and what \\nthey used to invent will fail them.\\n31. Say, “Who provides for you from the \\nheaven and the earth? And who controls the \\nhearing and the sight? And who produces the \\nliving from the dead, and produces the dead \\nfrom the living? And who governs the Or\\ufffeder?” They will say, “Allah.” Say, “Will you \\nnot be careful?”\\n32. Such is Allah, your Lord—the True. What \\nis there, beyond the truth, except falsehood? \\nHow are you turned away?\\n33. Thus your Lord’s Word proved true \\nagainst those who disobeyed, for they do not \\nbelieve.\\n34. Say, “Can any of your partners initiate cre\\ufffeation, and then repeat it?” Say, “Allah initi\\ufffeates creation, and then repeats it. How are \\nyou so deluded?”\\n35. Say, “Can any of your partners guide to the \\ntruth?” Say, “Allah guides to the truth. Is He \\nwho guides to the truth more worthy of being \\nfollowed, or he who does not guide, unless he \\nhimself is guided? What is the matter with \\nyou? How do you judge?”\\n36. Most of them follow nothing but assump\\ufffetions; and assumptions avail nothing against \\nthe truth. Allah is fully aware of what they do.\\n37. This Quran could not have been produced \\nby anyone other than Allah. In fact, it is a \\nconfirmation of what preceded it, and an \\nelaboration of the Book. There is no doubt\\nabout it—it is from the Lord of the Universe.\\n38. Or do they say, “He has forged it”? Say, \\n“Then produce a single chapter like it, and \\ncall upon whomever you can, apart from Al\\ufffelah, if you are truthful.”\\n39. In fact, they deny what is beyond the limits \\nof their knowledge, and whose explanation \\nhas not yet reached them. Thus those before \\nthem refused to believe. So note the conse\\ufffequences for the wrongdoers.\\n40. Among them are those who believe in it, \\nand among them are those who do not be\\ufffelieve in it. Your Lord is fully aware of the mis\\ufffechief-makers.\\n41. If they accuse you of lying, say, “I have my \\ndeeds, and you have your deeds. You are quit \\nof what I do, and I am quit of what you do.”\\n42. And among them are those who listen to \\nyou. But can you make the deaf hear, even \\nthough they do not understand?\\n43. And among them are those who look at \\nyou. But can you guide the blind, even \\nthough they do not see?\\n44. Allah does not wrong the people in the \\nleast, but the people wrong their own selves.\\n45. On the Day when He rounds them up—as \\nif they had tarried only one hour of a day—\\nthey will recognize one another. Those who \\n75\\n10. JONAH (Yunus)\\ndenied the meeting with Allah will be the los\\ufffeers. They were not guided.\\n46. Whether We show you some of what We \\npromise them, or take you, to Us is their re\\ufffeturn. Allah is witness to everything they do.\\n47. Every community has a messenger. When \\ntheir messenger has come, judgment will be \\npassed between them with fairness, and they \\nwill not be wronged.\\n48. And they say, “When will this promise be \\nfulfilled, if you are truthful?”\\n49. Say, “I have no power to harm or benefit \\nmyself, except as Allah wills. To every nation \\nis an appointed time. Then, when their time \\narrives, they can neither postpone it by one \\nhour, nor advance it.\\n50. Say, “Have you considered? If His punish\\ufffement overtakes you by night or by day, what \\npart of it will the guilty seek to hasten?”\\n51. “Then, when it falls, will you believe in it? \\nNow? When before you tried to hasten it?”\\n52. Then it will be said to those who did wrong, \\n“Taste the torment of eternity. Will you be re\\ufffewarded except for what you used to do?”\\n53. And they inquire of you, “Is it true?” Say, \\n“Yes, by my Lord, it is true, and you cannot \\nevade it.”\\n54. Had every soul which had done wrong pos\\ufffesessed everything on earth, it would offer it as \\na ransom. They will hide the remorse when \\nthey witness the suffering, and it will be \\njudged between them equitably, and they will \\nnot be wronged.\\n55. Assuredly, to Allah belongs everything in \\nthe heavens and the earth. Assuredly, the \\npromise of Allah is true. But most of them do \\nnot know.\\n56. He gives life and causes death, and to Him \\nyou will be returned.\\n57. O people! There has come to you advice \\nfrom your Lord, and healing for what is in the \\nhearts, and guidance and mercy for the be\\ufffelievers.\\n58. Say, “In Allah’s grace and mercy let them \\nrejoice. That is better than what they hoard.”\\n59. Say, “Have you considered the sustenance \\nAllah has sent down for you, some of which \\nyou made unlawful, and some lawful?” Say, \\n“Did Allah give you permission, or do you \\nfabricate lies and attribute them to Allah?”\\n60. What will they think—those who fabricate \\nlies and attribute them to Allah—on the Day \\nof Resurrection? Allah is bountiful towards \\nthe people, but most of them do not give \\nthanks.\\n61. You do not get into any situation, nor do \\nyou recite any Quran, nor do you do any\\ufffething, but We are watching over you as you \\nundertake it. Not even the weight of an atom, \\non earth or in the sky, escapes your Lord, nor \\nis there anything smaller or larger, but is in a \\nclear record.\\n62. Unquestionably, Allah’s friends have noth\\ufffeing to fear, nor shall they grieve.\\n63. Those who believe and are aware.\\n64. For them is good news in this life, and in \\nthe Hereafter. There is no alteration to the \\nwords of Allah. That is the supreme triumph.\\n65. And let not their sayings dishearten you. \\nAll power is Allah’s. He is the Hearer, the \\nKnower.\\n66. Certainly, to Allah belongs everyone in the \\nheavens and everyone on earth. Those who \\ninvoke other than Allah do not follow part\\ufffeners; they follow only assumptions, and they \\nonly guess.\\n67. It is He who made the night for your rest, \\nand the daylight for visibility. Surely in that \\nare signs for people who listen.\\n68. And they said, “Allah has taken a son.” Be \\nHe glorified. He is the Self-Sufficient. His is \\neverything in the heavens and everything on \\nearth. Do you have any proof for this? Or are \\nyou saying about Allah what you do not \\nknow?\\n69. Say, “Those who fabricate lies about Allah \\nwill not succeed.”\\n76\\n10. JONAH (Yunus)\\n70. Some enjoyment in this world; then to Us \\nis their return; then We will make them taste \\nthe severe punishment on account of their \\ndisbelief.\\n71. And relate to them the story of Noah, when \\nhe said to his people, “O my people, if my \\npresence among you and my reminding you \\nof Allah’s signs is too much for you, then in \\nAllah I have put my trust. So come to a deci\\ufffesion, you and your partners, and do not let \\nthe matter perplex you; then carry out your \\ndecision on me, and do not hold back.”\\n72. “But if you turn away, I have not asked you \\nfor any wage. My wage falls only on Allah, \\nand I was commanded to be of those who \\nsubmit.”\\n73. But they denounced him, so We saved him \\nand those with him in the Ark, and We made \\nthem successors, and We drowned those who \\nrejected Our signs. So consider the fate of \\nthose who were warned.\\n74. Then, after him, We sent messengers to \\ntheir people. They came to them with the \\nclear proofs, but they would not believe in an\\ufffeything they had already rejected. Thus We set \\na seal on the hearts of the hostile.\\n75. Then, after them, We sent Moses and Aa\\uffferon with Our proofs to Pharaoh and his dig\\ufffenitaries. But they acted arrogantly. They were \\nsinful people.\\n76. And when the truth came to them from Us, \\nthey said, “This is clearly sorcery.”\\n77. Moses said, “Is this what you say of the \\ntruth when it has come to you? Is this sor\\ufffecery? Sorcerers do not succeed.”\\n78. They said, “Did you come to us to divert us \\nfrom what we found our ancestors following, \\nand so that you become prominent in the \\nland? We will never believe in you.”\\n79. Pharaoh said, “Bring me every experienced \\nsorcerer.”\\n80. And when the sorcerers came, Moses said \\nto them, “Throw whatever you have to \\nthrow.”\\n81. And when they threw, Moses said, “What \\nyou produced is sorcery, and Allah will make \\nit fail. Allah does not foster the efforts of the\\ncorrupt.”\\n82. “And Allah upholds the truth with His \\nwords, even though the sinners detest it.”\\n83. But none believed in Moses except some \\nchildren of his people, for fear that Pharaoh \\nand his chiefs would persecute them. Phar\\ufffeaoh was high and mighty in the land. He was \\na tyrant.\\n84. Moses said, “O my people, if you have be\\ufffelieved in Allah, then put your trust in Him, if \\nyou have submitted.”\\n85. They said, “In Allah we have put our trust. \\nOur Lord, do not make us victims of the op\\ufffepressive people.”\\n86. “And deliver us, by Your mercy, from the \\ndisbelieving people.”\\n87. And We inspired Moses and his brother, \\n“Settle your people in Egypt, and make your \\nhomes places of worship, and perform the \\nprayer, and give good news to the believers.”\\n88. Moses said, “Our Lord, you have given \\nPharaoh and his chiefs splendor and wealth \\nin the worldly life. Our Lord, for them to lead \\naway from Your path. Our Lord, obliterate \\ntheir wealth, and harden their hearts, they \\nwill not believe until they see the painful tor\\ufffement.”\\n89. He said, “Your prayer has been answered, \\nso go straight, and do not follow the path of \\nthose who do not know.”\\n90. And We delivered the Children of Israel \\nacross the sea. Pharaoh and his troops pur\\ufffesued them, defiantly and aggressively. Until, \\nwhen he was about to drown, he said, “I be\\ufffelieve that there is no god except the One the \\nChildren of Israel believe in, and I am of \\nthose who submit.”\\n91. Now? When you have rebelled before, and \\nbeen of the mischief-makers?\\n92. Today We will preserve your body, so that \\nyou become a sign for those after you. But \\nmost people are heedless of Our signs.\\n77\\n11. HUD (Hud)\\n93. And We settled the Children of Israel in a \\nposition of honor, and provided them with \\ngood things. They did not differ until \\nknowledge came to them. Your Lord will \\njudge between them on the Day of Resurrec\\ufffetion regarding their differences.\\n94. If you are in doubt about what We revealed \\nto you, ask those who read the Scripture be\\ufffefore you. The truth has come to you from \\nyour Lord, so do not be of those who doubt.\\n95. And do not be of those who deny Allah’s \\nrevelations, lest you become one of the losers.\\n96. Those against whom your Lord’s Word is \\njustified will not believe.\\n97. Even if every sign comes to them—until \\nthey see the painful punishment.\\n98. If only there was one town that believed \\nand benefited by its belief. Except for the peo\\ufffeple of Jonah. When they believed, We re\\ufffemoved from them the suffering of disgrace in \\nthe worldly life, and We gave them comfort \\nfor a while.\\n99. Had your Lord willed, everyone on earth \\nwould have believed. Will you compel people \\nto become believers?\\n100. No soul can believe except by Allah’s \\nleave; and He lays disgrace upon those who \\nrefuse to understand.\\n101. Say, “Look at what is in the heavens and \\nthe earth.” But signs and warnings are of no \\navail for people who do not believe.\\n102. Do they expect anything but the likes of \\nthe days of those who passed away before \\nthem? Say, “Then wait, I will be waiting with \\nyou.”\\n103. Then We save Our messengers and those \\nwho believe. It is binding on Us to save the\\nbelievers.\\n104. Say, “O people, if you are in doubt about \\nmy religion—I do not serve those you serve \\napart from Allah. But I serve Allah, the one \\nwho will terminate your lives. And I was \\ncommanded to be of the believers.”\\n105. And dedicate yourself to the true reli\\ufffegion—a monotheist—and never be of the \\npolytheists.\\n106. And do not call, apart from Allah, on what \\nneither benefits you nor harms you. If you \\ndo, you are then one of the wrongdoers.\\n107. If Allah afflicts you with harm, none can \\nremove it except He. And if He wants good \\nfor you, none can repel His grace. He makes \\nit reach whomever He wills of His servants. \\nHe is the Forgiver, the Merciful.\\n108. Say, “O people, the truth has come to you \\nfrom your Lord. Whoever accepts guidance is \\nguided for his own soul; and whoever strays \\nonly strays to its detriment. I am not a guard\\ufffeian over you.”\\n109. And follow what is revealed to you, and be \\npatient until Allah issues His judgment, for \\nHe is the Best of judges.\\n11. HUD\\n(Hud)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Alif, Lam, Ra. A Scripture whose Verses \\nwere perfected, then elaborated, from One \\nwho is Wise and Informed.\\n2. That you shall worship none but Allah. “I \\nam a warner to you from Him, and a bearer \\nof good news.”\\n3. “And ask your Lord for forgiveness, and re\\ufffepent to Him. He will provide you with good \\nsustenance until a stated term, and will be\\ufffestow His grace on every possessor of virtue. \\nBut if you turn away, then I fear for you the \\npunishment of a grievous Day.”\\n4. “To Allah is your return, and He is Capable \\nof all things.”\\n5. They wrap their chests to hide from Him. \\nBut even as they cover themselves with their \\nclothes, He knows what they conceal and \\nwhat they reveal. He knows what lies within \\nthe hearts.\\n78\\n11. HUD (Hud)\\n6. There is no moving creature on earth but its \\nsustenance depends on Allah. And He knows \\nwhere it lives and where it rests. Everything is \\nin a Clear Book.\\n7. It is He who created the heavens and the \\nearth in six days—and His Throne was upon \\nthe waters—in order to test you—which of \\nyou is best in conduct. And if you were to say, \\n“You will be resurrected after death,” those \\nwho disbelieve would say, “This is nothing \\nbut plain witchcraft.”\\n8. And if We postponed their punishment un\\ufffetil a stated time, they would say, “What holds \\nit back?” On the Day when it reaches them, it \\nwill not be averted from them, and what they \\nused to ridicule will besiege them.\\n9. If We give the human being a taste of mercy \\nfrom Us, and then withdraw it from him, he \\nbecomes despairing and ungrateful.\\n10. And if We give him a taste of prosperity, \\nafter some adversity has afflicted him, he will \\nsay, “Troubles have gone away from me.” He \\nbecomes excited and proud.\\n11. Except those who are patient and do good \\ndeeds—these will have forgiveness and a \\ngreat reward.\\n12. Perhaps you wish to disregard some of \\nwhat is revealed to you, and you may be \\nstressed because of it, since they say, “If only \\na treasure was sent down to him, or an angel \\ncame with him.” You are only a warner, and \\nAllah is Responsible for all things.\\n13. Or do they say, “He invented it?” Say, \\n“Then produce ten chapters like it, invented, \\nand call upon whomever you can, besides Al\\ufffelah, if you are truthful.”\\n14. But if they fail to answer you, know that it \\nwas revealed with Allah’s knowledge, and \\nthat there is no god but He. Will you then \\nsubmit?\\n15. Whoever desires the worldly life and its \\nglitter—We will fully recompense them for \\ntheir deeds therein, and therein they will not \\nbe defrauded.\\n16. These—they will have nothing but the Fire \\nin the Hereafter. Their deeds are in vain \\ntherein, and their works are null.\\n17. Is he who possesses a clear proof from his \\nLord, recited by a witness from Him, and be\\ufffefore it the Book of Moses, a guide and a \\nmercy? These believe in it. But whoever defies \\nit from among the various factions, the Fire is \\nhis promise. So have no doubt about it. It is \\nthe truth from your Lord, but most people do \\nnot believe.\\n18. Who does greater wrong than he who fab\\ufffericates lies about Allah? These will be pre\\ufffesented before their Lord, and the witnesses \\nwill say, “These are they who lied about their \\nLord.” Indeed, the curse of Allah is upon the \\nwrongdoers.\\n19. Those who hinder others from the path of \\nAllah, and seek to make it crooked; and re\\ufffegarding the Hereafter, they are in denial.\\n20. These will not escape on earth, and they \\nhave no protectors besides Allah. The pun\\ufffeishment will be doubled for them. They have \\nfailed to hear, and they have failed to see.\\n21. Those are the ones who lost their souls, and \\nwhat they had invented has strayed away \\nfrom them.\\n22. Without a doubt, in the Hereafter, they will \\nbe the biggest losers.\\n23. As for those who believe and do good \\ndeeds, and humble themselves before their \\nLord—these are the inhabitants of Paradise, \\nwhere they will abide forever.\\n24. The parable of the two groups is that of the \\nblind and the deaf, and the seeing and the \\nhearing. Are they equal in comparison? Will \\nyou not reflect?\\n25. We sent Noah to his people, “I am to you a \\nclear warner.”\\n26. “That you shall worship none but Allah. I \\nfear for you the agony of a painful Day.”\\n27. The notables who disbelieved among his \\npeople said, “We see in you nothing but a \\nman like us, and we see that only the worst \\n79\\n11. HUD (Hud)\\namong us have followed you, those of imma\\ufffeture judgment. And we see that you have no \\nadvantage over us. In fact, we think you are \\nliars.”\\n28. He said, “O my people, Have you consid\\ufffeered? If I stand on clear evidence from my \\nLord, and He has given me a mercy from \\nHimself, but you were blind to it, can we \\ncompel you to accept it, even though you dis\\ufffelike it?”\\n29. “O my people! I ask of you no money for it. \\nMy reward lies only with Allah. And I am not \\nabout to dismiss those who believed; they will \\nsurely meet their Lord. And I see that you are \\nignorant people.”\\n30. “O my people! Who will support me \\nagainst Allah, if I dismiss them? Will you not \\ngive a thought?”\\n31. “I do not say to you that I possess the treas\\ufffeures of Allah, nor do I know the future, nor \\ndo I say that I am an angel. Nor do I say of \\nthose who are despicable in your eyes that Al\\ufffelah will never give them any good. Allah is \\nAware of what lies in their souls. If I did, I \\nwould be one of the wrongdoers.”\\n32. They said, “O Noah, you have argued with \\nus, and argued a great deal. Now bring upon \\nus what you threaten us with, if you are truth\\ufffeful.”\\n33. He said, “It is Allah who will bring it upon \\nyou, if He wills, and you will not be able to \\nescape.”\\n34. “My advice will not benefit you, much as I \\nmay want to advise you, if Allah desires to \\nconfound you. He is your Lord, and to Him \\nyou will be returned.”\\n35. Or do they say, “He made it up?” Say, “If I \\nmade it up, upon me falls my crime, and I am \\ninnocent of the crimes you commit.”\\n36. And it was revealed to Noah: “None of \\nyour people will believe, except those who \\nhave already believed, so do not grieve over\\nwhat they do.”\\n37. “And build the Ark, under Our eyes, and \\nwith Our inspiration, and do not address Me \\nregarding those who did wrong; they are to \\nbe drowned.”\\n38. As he was building the ark, whenever some \\nof his people passed by him, they ridiculed \\nhim. He said, “If you ridicule us, we will ridi\\ufffecule you, just as you ridicule.”\\n39. “You will surely know upon whom will \\ncome a torment that will abase him, and upon \\nwhom will fall a lasting torment.”\\n40. Until, when Our command came, and the \\nvolcano erupted, We said, “Board into it a \\npair of every kind, and your family—except \\nthose against whom the sentence has already \\nbeen passed—and those who have believed.” \\nBut those who believed with him were only a \\nfew.\\n41. He said, “Embark in it. In the name of Al\\ufffelah shall be its sailing and its anchorage. My \\nLord is indeed Forgiving and Merciful.”\\n42. And so it sailed with them amidst waves \\nlike hills. And Noah called to his son, who \\nhad kept away, “O my son! Embark with us, \\nand do not be with the disbelievers.”\\n43. He said, “I will take refuge on a moun\\ufffetain—it will protect me from the water.” He \\nsaid, “There is no protection from Allah’s de\\ufffecree today, except for him on whom He has \\nmercy.” And the waves surged between them, \\nand he was among the drowned.\\n44. And it was said,“O earth, swallow your wa\\ufffeters,” and “O heaven, clear up.” And the wa\\ufffeters receded, and the event was concluded, \\nand it settled on Judi, and it was proclaimed: \\n“Away with the wicked people.”\\n45. And Noah called to his Lord. He said, “O \\nMy Lord, my son is of my family, and Your \\npromise is true, and You are the Wisest of the \\nwise.”\\n46. He said, “O Noah, he is not of your family. \\nIt is an unrighteous deed. So do not ask Me \\nabout something you know nothing about. I \\nadmonish you, lest you be one of the igno\\uffferant.”\\n47. He said, “O My Lord, I seek refuge with \\nYou, from asking You about what I have no \\n80\\n11. HUD (Hud)\\nknowledge of. Unless You forgive me, and \\nhave mercy on me, I will be one of the losers.”\\n48. It was said, “O Noah, disembark with peace \\nfrom Us; and with blessings upon you, and \\nupon communities from those with you. And \\nother communities We will grant prosperity, \\nand then a painful torment from Us will be\\ufffefall them.”\\n49. These are some stories from the past that \\nwe reveal to you. Neither you, nor your peo\\ufffeple knew them before this. So be patient. The \\nfuture belongs to the pious.\\n50. And to Aad, their brother Hud. He said, “O \\nmy people, worship Allah, you have no other \\ngod besides Him. You do nothing but invent \\nlies.”\\n51. “O my people, I ask you no wage for it; my \\nwage lies with Him who originated me. Do \\nyou not understand?”\\n52. “O my people, ask forgiveness from your \\nLord, and repent to Him. He will release the \\nsky pouring down upon you, and will add \\nstrength to your strength. And do not turn \\naway and be wicked.”\\n53. They said, “O Hud, you did not bring us \\nany evidence, and we are not about to aban\\ufffedon our gods at your word, and we are not \\nbelievers in you.”\\n54. “We only say that some of our gods have \\npossessed you with evil.” He said, “I call Allah \\nto witness, and you to witness, that I am in\\ufffenocent of what you associate.\\n55. Besides Him. So scheme against me, all of \\nyou, and do not hesitate.\\n56. I have placed my trust in Allah, my Lord \\nand your Lord. There is not a creature but He \\nholds it by the forelock. My Lord is on a \\nstraight path.\\n57. If you turn away, I have conveyed to you \\nwhat I was sent to you with; and my Lord will \\nreplace you with another people, and you will \\nnot cause Him any harm. My Lord is Guard\\ufffeian over all things.”\\n58. And when Our decree came, We saved \\nHud and those who believed with him, by a \\nmercy from Us, and We delivered them from \\na harsh punishment.\\n59. That was Aad; they denied the signs of \\ntheir Lord, and defied His messengers, and \\nfollowed the lead of every stubborn tyrant.\\n60. And they were pursued by a curse in this \\nworld, and on the Day of Resurrection. In\\ufffedeed, Aad blasphemed against their Lord—so \\naway with Aad, the people of Hud.\\n61. And to Thamood, their brother Saleh. He \\nsaid, “O my people, worship Allah, you have \\nno god other than Him. He initiated you \\nfrom the earth, and settled you in it. So seek \\nHis forgiveness, and repent to Him. My Lord \\nis Near and Responsive.”\\n62. They said, “O Saleh, we had hopes in you \\nbefore this. Are you trying to prevent us from \\nworshiping what our parents worship? We \\nare in serious doubt regarding what you are \\ncalling us to.”\\n63. He said, “O my people, have you consid\\ufffeered? If I stand upon clear evidence from my \\nLord, and He has given me mercy from Him, \\nwho would protect me from Allah, if I diso\\ufffebeyed Him? You add nothing for me except \\nloss.”\\n64. “O my people, this is the she-camel of Al\\ufffelah, a sign for you. Let her graze on Allah’s \\nland, and do not harm her, lest an imminent \\npunishment overtakes you.”\\n65. But they hamstrung her, and so He said, \\n“Enjoy yourselves in your homes for three \\ndays. This is a prophecy that is infallible.”\\n66. Then, when Our command came, We \\nsaved Saleh and those who believed with him, \\nby a mercy from Us, from the disgrace of that \\nday. Your Lord is the Strong, the Mighty.\\n67. And the Scream struck those who trans\\ufffegressed, and they became motionless bodies \\nin their homes.\\n68. As if they had never prospered therein. In\\ufffedeed, Thamood rejected their Lord, so away \\nwith Thamood.\\n69. Our messengers came to Abraham with \\ngood news. They said, “Peace.” He said,\\n81\\n11. HUD (Hud)\\n“Peace.” Soon after, he came with a roasted \\ncalf.\\n70. But when he saw their hands not reaching \\ntowards it, he became suspicious of them, \\nand conceived a fear of them. They said, “Do \\nnot fear, we were sent to the people of Lot.”\\n71. His wife was standing by, so she laughed. \\nAnd We gave her good news of Isaac; and af\\ufffeter Isaac, Jacob.\\n72. She said, “Alas for me. Shall I give birth, \\nwhen I am an old woman, and this, my hus\\ufffeband, is an old man? This is truly a strange \\nthing.” \\n73. They said, “Do you marvel at the decree of \\nAllah? The mercy and blessings of Allah are \\nupon you, O people of the house. He is \\nPraiseworthy and Glorious.”\\n74. When Abraham's fear subsided, and the \\ngood news had reached him, he started plead\\ufffeing with Us concerning the people of Lot.\\n75. Abraham was gentle, kind, penitent.\\n76. “O Abraham, refrain from this. The com\\ufffemand of your Lord has come; they have in\\ufffecurred an irreversible punishment.”\\n77. And when Our envoys came to Lot, he was \\nanxious for them, and concerned for them. \\nHe said, “This is a dreadful day.”\\n78. And his people came rushing towards \\nhim—they were in the habit of committing \\nsins. He said, “O my people, these are my \\ndaughters; they are purer for you. So fear Al\\ufffelah, and do not embarrass me before my \\nguests. Is there not one reasonable man \\namong you?”\\n79. They said, “You know well that we have no \\nright to your daughters, and you know well \\nwhat we want.”\\n80. He said, “If only I had the strength to stop \\nyou, or could rely on some strong support.”\\n81. They said, “O Lot, we are the envoys of \\nyour Lord; they will not reach you. So set out \\nwith your family during the cover of the \\nnight, and let none of you look back, except \\nfor your wife. She will be struck by what will \\nstrike them. Their appointed time is the \\nmorning. Is not the morning near?”\\n82. And when Our command came about, We \\nturned it upside down, and We rained down \\non it stones of baked clay.\\n83. Marked from your Lord, and never far \\nfrom the wrongdoers.\\n84. And to Median, their brother Shuaib. He \\nsaid, “O my people, worship Allah; you have \\nno god other than Him. And do not short \\nmeasure or short weight. I see you in good \\ncircumstances, but I fear for you the agony of \\nan encompassing Day.”\\n85. “O my people! Give full measure and full \\nweight, in all fairness, and do not cheat the \\npeople out of their rights, and do not spread \\ncorruption in the land.\\n86. What is left by Allah is best for you, if you \\nare believers. And I am not a guardian over \\nyou.”\\n87. They said, “O Shuaib, does your prayer \\ncommand you that we abandon what our an\\ufffecestors worshiped, or doing with our wealth \\nwhat we want? You are the one who is intel\\ufffeligent and wise.”\\n88. He said, “O my people, have you consid\\ufffeered? What if I have clear evidence from my \\nLord, and He has given me good livelihood \\nfrom Himself? I have no desire to do what I \\nforbid you from doing. I desire nothing but \\nreform, as far as I can. My success lies only \\nwith Allah. In Him I trust, and to Him I \\nturn.”\\n89. “O my people, let not your hostility to\\ufffewards me cause you to suffer what was suf\\ufffefered by the people of Noah, or the people of \\nHud, or the people of Saleh. The people of Lot \\nare not far away from you.”\\n90. “And ask your Lord for forgiveness, and re\\ufffepent to Him. My Lord is Merciful and Lov\\ufffeing.”\\n91. They said, “O Shuaib, we do not under\\ufffestand much of what you say, and we see that \\nyou are weak among us. Were it not for your \\n82\\n11. HUD (Hud)\\ntribe, we would have stoned you. You are of \\nno value to us.”\\n92. He said, “O my people, is my tribe more \\nimportant to you than Allah? And you have \\nturned your backs on Him? My Lord com\\ufffeprehends everything you do.”\\n93. “O my people, do as you may, and so will I. \\nYou will know to whom will come a punish\\ufffement that will shame him, and who is a liar. \\nSo look out; I am on the lookout with you.”\\n94. And when Our command came, We saved \\nShuaib and those who believed with him, by \\nmercy from Us, and the Blast struck the \\nwrongdoers, and they became motionless \\nbodies in their homes.\\n95. As though they never flourished therein. \\nAway with Median, as was done away with \\nThamood.\\n96. And We sent Moses with Our signs and a \\nclear mandate.\\n97. To Pharaoh and his nobles, but they fol\\ufffelowed the command of Pharaoh, and the \\ncommand of Pharaoh was not wise.\\n98. He will precede his people on the Day of \\nResurrection, and will lead them into the \\nFire. Miserable is the place he placed them in.\\n99. They were followed by a curse in this, and \\non the Day of Resurrection. Miserable is the \\npath they followed.\\n100. These are of the reports of the towns—We \\nrelate them to you. Some are still standing, \\nand some have withered away.\\n101.We did not wrong them, but they wronged \\nthemselves. Their gods, whom they invoked \\nbesides Allah, availed them nothing when the \\ncommand of your Lord arrived. In fact, they \\nadded only to their ruin.\\n102. Such is the grip of your Lord when He \\nseizes the towns in the midst of their sins. His \\ngrip is most painful, most severe.\\n103. In that is a sign for whoever fears the pun\\ufffeishment of the Hereafter. That is a Day for \\nwhich humanity will be gathered together—\\nthat is a Day to be witnessed.\\n104. We only postpone it until a predetermined \\ntime.\\n105. On the Day when it arrives, no soul will \\nspeak without His permission. Some will be \\nmiserable, and some will be happy.\\n106. As for those who are miserable, they will \\nbe in the Fire. They will have therein sighing \\nand wailing.\\n107. Remaining therein for as long as the heav\\ufffeens and the earth endure, except as your Lord \\nwills. Your Lord is Doer of whatever He wills.\\n108. And as for those who are happy, they will \\nbe in Paradise, remaining therein for as long \\nas the heavens and the earth endure, except \\nas your Lord wills—a reward without end.\\n109. So be not in doubt regarding what these \\npeople worship. They worship only as their \\nancestors worshiped before. We will pay \\nthem their due in full, without any reduction.\\n110. We gave Moses the Scripture, but it was \\ndisputed. Were it not for a prior word from \\nyour Lord, it would have been settled be\\ufffetween them. They are in serious doubt con\\ufffecerning it.\\n111. Your Lord will repay each one of them in \\nfull for their deeds. He is Aware of everything \\nthey do.\\n112. So be upright, as you are commanded, \\nalong with those who repented with you, and \\ndo not transgress. He is Seeing of everything \\nyou do.\\n113. And do not incline towards those who do \\nwrong, or the Fire may touch you; and you \\nwill have no protectors besides Allah, and \\nyou will not be saved.\\n114. Perform the prayer at the borders of the \\nday, and during the approaches of the night. \\nThe good deeds take away the bad deeds. This \\nis a reminder for those who remember.\\n115. And be patient. Allah will not waste the re\\ufffeward of the virtuous.\\n116. If only there were, among the generations \\nbefore you, people with wisdom, who spoke \\nagainst corruption on earth—except for the \\nfew whom We saved. But the wrongdoers \\n83\\n12. JOSEPH (Yusuf)\\npursued the luxuries they were indulged in, \\nand thus became guilty.\\n117. Your Lord would never destroy the towns \\nwrongfully, while their inhabitants are right\\ufffeeous. \\n118. Had your Lord willed, He could have \\nmade humanity one community, but they \\ncontinue to differ.\\n119. Except those on whom your Lord has\\nmercy—for that reason He created them. The \\nWord of your Lord is final: “I will fill Hell \\nwith jinn and humans, altogether.”\\n120. Everything We narrate to you of the his\\ufffetory of the messengers is to strengthen your \\nheart therewith. The truth has come to you in \\nthis, and a lesson, and a reminder for the be\\ufffelievers.\\n121. And say to those who do not believe, “Act \\naccording to your ability; and so will we.”\\n122. “And wait; we too are waiting.”\\n123. To Allah belongs the future of the heavens \\nand the earth, and to Him all authority goes \\nback. So worship Him, and rely on Him. \\nYour Lord is never unaware of what you do.\\n12. JOSEPH\\n(Yusuf)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Alif, Lam, Ra. These are the Verses of the \\nClear Book.\\n2. We have revealed it an Arabic Quran, so \\nthat you may understand.\\n3. We narrate to you the most accurate his\\ufffetory, by revealing to you this Quran. Alt\\ufffehough, prior to it, you were of the unaware.\\n4. When Joseph said to his father, “O my fa\\ufffether, I saw eleven planets, and the sun, and \\nthe moon; I saw them bowing down to me.”\\n5. He said, “O my son, do not relate your vi\\ufffesion to your brothers, lest they plot and \\nscheme against you. Satan is man's sworn en\\ufffeemy.\\n6. And thus your Lord will choose you, and \\nwill teach you the interpretation of events, \\nand will complete His blessing upon you and \\nupon the family of Jacob, as He has com\\ufffepleted it before upon your forefathers Abra\\ufffeham and Isaac. Your Lord is Knowing and \\nWise.\\n7. In Joseph and his brothers are lessons for \\nthe seekers.\\n8. When they said, “Joseph and his brother are \\ndearer to our father than we are, although we \\nare a whole group. Our father is obviously in \\nthe wrong.\\n9. “Kill Joseph, or throw him somewhere in \\nthe land, and your father‘s attention will be \\nyours. Afterwards, you will be decent peo\\ufffeple.”\\n10. One of them said, “Do not kill Joseph, but \\nthrow him into the bottom of the well; some \\ncaravan may pick him up—if you must do \\nsomething.”\\n11. They said, “Father, why do you not trust us \\nwith Joseph, although we care for him?”\\n12. “Send him with us tomorrow, that he may \\nroam and play; we will take care of him.”\\n13. He said, “It worries me that you would take \\nhim away. And I fear the wolf may eat him \\nwhile you are careless of him.”\\n14. They said, “If the wolf ate him, and we are \\nmany, we would be good for nothing.”\\n15. So they went away with him, and agreed to \\nput him at the bottom of the well. And We \\ninspired him, “You will inform them of this \\ndeed of theirs when they are unaware.”\\n16. And they came to their father in the even\\ufffeing weeping.\\n17. They said, “O father, we went off racing \\none another, and left Joseph by our belong\\ufffeings; and the wolf ate him. But you will not \\nbelieve us, even though we are being truth\\ufffeful.”\\n18. And they brought his shirt, with fake blood \\non it. He said, “Your souls enticed you to do \\nsomething. But patience is beautiful, and Al\\ufffelah is my Help against what you describe.”\\n84\\n12. JOSEPH (Yusuf)\\n19. A caravan passed by, and they sent their \\nwater-carrier. He lowered his bucket, and \\nsaid, “Good news. Here is a boy.” And they \\nhid him as merchandise. But Allah was aware \\nof what they did.\\n20. And they sold him for a cheap price—a few \\ncoins—they considered him to be of little \\nvalue.\\n21. The Egyptian who bought him said to his \\nwife, “Take good care of him; he may be use\\ufffeful to us, or we may adopt him as a son.” We \\nthus established Joseph in the land, to teach \\nhim the interpretation of events. Allah has \\ncontrol over His affairs, but most people do \\nnot know.\\n22. When he reached his maturity, We gave \\nhim wisdom and knowledge. We thus reward \\nthe righteous.\\n23. She in whose house he was living tried to \\nseduce him. She shut the doors, and said, “I \\nam yours.” He said, “Allah forbid! He is my \\nLord. He has given me a good home. Sinners \\nnever succeed.”\\n24. She desired him, and he desired her, had he \\nnot seen the proof of his Lord. It was thus that \\nWe diverted evil and indecency away from \\nhim. He was one of Our loyal servants.\\n25. As they raced towards the door, she tore his \\nshirt from behind. At the door, they ran into \\nher husband. She said, “What is the penalty \\nfor him who desired to dishonor your wife, \\nexcept imprisonment or a painful punish\\ufffement?”\\n26. He said, “It was she who tried to seduce \\nme.” A witness from her household sug\\ufffegested: “If his shirt is torn from the front: \\nthen she has told the truth, and he is the liar.\\n27. But if his shirt is torn from the back: then \\nshe has lied, and he is the truthful.”\\n28. And when he saw that his shirt was torn \\nfrom the back, he said, “This is a woman's \\nscheme. Your scheming is serious indeed.”\\n29. “Joseph, turn away from this. And you, \\nwoman, ask forgiveness for your sin; you are \\nindeed in the wrong.”\\n30. Some ladies in the city said, “The gover\\ufffenor's wife is trying to seduce her servant. She \\nis deeply in love with him. We see she has \\ngone astray.”\\n31. And when she heard of their gossip, she in\\ufffevited them, and prepared for them a banquet, \\nand she gave each one of them a knife. She \\nsaid, “Come out before them.” And when \\nthey saw him, they marveled at him, and cut \\ntheir hands. They said, “Good Allah, this is \\nnot a human, this must be a precious angel.”\\n32. She said, “Here he is, the one you blamed \\nme for. I did try to seduce him, but he re\\ufffesisted. But if he does not do what I tell him to \\ndo, he will be imprisoned, and will be one of \\nthe despised.”\\n33. He said, “My Lord, prison is more desira\\ufffeble to me than what they call me to. Unless \\nYou turn their scheming away from me, I \\nmay yield to them, and become one of the ig\\ufffenorant.”\\n34. Thereupon his Lord answered him, and di\\ufffeverted their scheming away from him. He is \\nthe Hearer, the Knower.\\n35. Then it occurred to them, after they had \\nseen the signs, to imprison him for a while.\\n36. Two youth entered the prison with him. \\nOne of them said, “I see myself pressing \\nwine.” The other said, “I see myself carrying \\nbread on my head, from which the birds are \\neating. Tell us their interpretation—we see \\nthat you are one of the righteous.”\\n37. He said, “No food is served to you, but I \\nhave informed you about it before you have \\nreceived it. That is some of what my Lord has \\ntaught me. I have forsaken the tradition of \\npeople who do not believe in Allah; and re\\ufffegarding the Hereafter, they are deniers.”\\n38. “And I have followed the faith of my fore\\ufffefathers, Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob. It is \\nnot for us to associate anything with Allah. \\nThis is by virtue of Allah’s grace upon us and \\nupon the people, but most people do not give \\nthanks.\\n39. “O My fellow inmates, are diverse lords \\nbetter, or Allah, the One, the Supreme?”\\n85\\n12. JOSEPH (Yusuf)\\n40. “You do not worship, besides Him, except \\nnames you have named, you and your ances\\ufffetors, for which Allah has sent down no au\\ufffethority. Judgment belongs to none but Allah. \\nHe has commanded that you worship none \\nbut Him. This is the right religion, but most \\npeople do not know.\\n41. “O my fellow inmates! One of you will \\nserve his master wine; while the other will be \\ncrucified, and the birds will eat from his head. \\nThus the matter you are inquiring about is \\nsettled.”\\n42. And he said to the one he thought would \\nbe released, “Mention me to your master.” \\nBut Satan caused him to forget mentioning \\nhim to his master, so he remained in prison \\nfor several years.\\n43. The king said, “I see seven fat cows being \\neaten by seven lean ones, and seven green \\nspikes, and others dried up. O elders, explain \\nto me my vision, if you are able to interpret \\nvisions.”\\n44. They said, “Jumbles of dreams, and we \\nknow nothing of the interpretation of \\ndreams.”\\n45. The one who was released said, having re\\ufffemembered after a time, “I will inform you of \\nits interpretation, so send me out.”\\n46. “Joseph, O man of truth, inform us con\\ufffecerning seven fat cows being eaten by seven \\nlean ones, and seven green spikes, and others \\ndried up, so that I may return to the people, \\nso that they may know.”\\n47. He said, “You will farm for seven consecu\\ufffetive years. But whatever you harvest, leave it \\nin its spikes, except for the little that you eat.”\\n48. Then after that will come seven difficult \\nones, which will consume what you have \\nstored for them, except for the little that you \\nhave preserved.\\n49. Then after that will come a year that brings \\nrelief to the people, and during which they \\nwill press.\\n50. The king said, “Bring him to me.” And \\nwhen the envoy came to him, he said, “Go \\nback to your master, and ask him about the \\nintentions of the women who cut their hands; \\nmy Lord is well aware of their schemes.”\\n51. He said, “What was the matter with you, \\nwomen, when you tried to seduce Joseph?” \\nThey said, “Allah forbid! We knew of no evil \\ncommitted by him.” The governor’s wife then \\nsaid, “Now the truth is out. It was I who tried \\nto seduce him, and he is telling the truth.”\\n52. “This is that he may know that I did not \\nbetray him in secret, and that Allah does not \\nguide the scheming of the betrayers.”\\n53. “Yet I do not claim to be innocent. The soul \\ncommands evil, except those on whom my \\nLord has mercy. Truly my Lord is Forgiving \\nand Merciful.”\\n54. The king said, “Bring him to me, and I will \\nreserve him for myself.” And when he spoke \\nto him, he said, “This day you are with us es\\ufffetablished and secure.” \\n55. He said, “Put me in charge of the store\\ufffehouses of the land; I am honest and knowl\\ufffeedgeable.”\\n56. And thus We established Joseph in the \\nland, to live therein wherever he wished. We \\ntouch with Our mercy whomever We will, \\nand We never waste the reward of the right\\ufffeeous.\\n57. But the reward of the Hereafter is better for \\nthose who believe and observed piety.\\n58. And Joseph's brothers came, and entered \\ninto his presence. He recognized them, but \\nthey did not recognize him.\\n59. When he provided them with their provi\\ufffesions, he said, “Bring me a brother of yours \\nfrom your father. Do you not see that I fill up \\nthe measure, and I am the best of hosts?”\\n60. “But if you do not bring him to me, you will \\nhave no measure from me, and you will not \\ncome near me.”\\n61. They said, “We will solicit him from his fa\\ufffether. We will surely do.”\\n62. He said to his servants, “Put their goods in \\ntheir saddlebags; perhaps they will recognize \\n86\\n12. JOSEPH (Yusuf)\\nthem when they return to their families, and \\nmaybe they will come back.”\\n63. When they returned to their father, they \\nsaid, “O father, we were denied measure, but \\nsend our brother with us, and we will obtain \\nmeasure. We will take care of him.”\\n64. He said, “Shall I trust you with him, as I \\ntrusted you with his brother before? Allah is \\nthe Best Guardian, and He is the Most Mer\\ufffeciful of the merciful.”\\n65. And when they opened their baggage, they \\nfound that their goods were returned to \\nthem. They said, “Father, what more do we \\nwant? Here are our goods, returned to us. We \\nwill provide for our family, and protect our \\nbrother, and have an additional camel-load. \\nThis is easy commerce.”\\n66. He said, “I will not send him with you, un\\ufffeless you give me a pledge before Allah that \\nyou will bring him back to me, unless you get \\ntrapped.” And when they gave him their \\npledge, he said, “Allah is witness to what we \\nsay.”\\n67. And he said, “O my sons, do not enter by \\none gate, but enter by different gates. I cannot \\navail you anything against Allah. The deci\\ufffesion rests only with Allah. On Him I rely, and \\non Him let the reliant rely.”\\n68. And when they entered as their father had \\ninstructed them, it did not avail them any\\ufffething against Allah; it was just a need in the \\nsoul of Jacob, which he carried out. He was a \\nperson of knowledge inasmuch as We had \\ntaught him, but most people do not know.\\n69. And when they entered into the presence \\nof Joseph, he embraced his brother, and said, \\n“I am your brother; do not be saddened by \\nwhat they used to do.”\\n70. Then, when he provided them with their \\nprovisions, he placed the drinking-cup in his \\nbrother’s saddlebag. Then an announcer \\ncalled out, “O people of the caravan, you are\\nthieves.”\\n71. They said, as they came towards them, \\n“What are you missing?”\\n72. They said, “We are missing the king’s gob\\ufffelet. Whoever brings it will have a camel-load; \\nand I personally guarantee it.”\\n73. They said, “By Allah, you know we did not \\ncome to cause trouble in the land, and we are \\nnot thieves.”\\n74. They said, “What shall be his punishment, \\nif you are lying?”\\n75. They said, “His punishment, if it is found \\nin his bag: he will belong to you. Thus we pe\\ufffenalize the guilty.”\\n76. So he began with their bags, before his \\nbrother's bag. Then he pulled it out of his \\nbrother’s bag. Thus We devised a plan for Jo\\ufffeseph; he could not have detained his brother \\nunder the king’s law, unless Allah so willed. \\nWe elevate by degrees whomever We will; \\nand above every person of knowledge, there \\nis one more learned.\\n77. They said, “If he has stolen, a brother of his \\nhas stolen before.” But Joseph kept it to him\\ufffeself, and did not reveal it to them. He said, \\n“You are in a worse situation, and Allah is \\nAware of what you allege.”\\n78. They said, “O noble prince, he has a father, \\na very old man, so take one of us in his place. \\nWe see that you are a good person.”\\n79. He said, “Allah forbid that we should arrest \\nanyone except him in whose possession we \\nfound our property; for then we would be un\\ufffejust.”\\n80. And when they despaired of him, they con\\ufffeferred privately. Their eldest said, “Don’t you \\nknow that your father received a pledge from \\nyou before Allah, and in the past you failed \\nwith regard to Joseph? I will not leave this \\nland until my father permits me, or Allah de\\ufffecides for me; for He is the Best of Deciders.”\\n81. “Go back to your father, and say, ‘Our fa\\ufffether, your son has stolen. We testify only to \\nwhat we know, and we could not have pre\\ufffevented the unforeseen.’”\\n82. “Ask the town where we were, and the car\\ufffeavan in which we came. We are being truth\\ufffeful.”\\n87\\n12. JOSEPH (Yusuf)\\n83. He said, “Rather, your souls have contrived \\nsomething for you. Patience is a virtue. Per\\ufffehaps Allah will bring them all back to me. He \\nis the Knowing, the Wise.”\\n84. Then he turned away from them, and said, \\n“O my bitterness for Joseph.” And his eyes \\nturned white from sorrow, and he became \\ndepressed.\\n85. They said, “By Allah, you will not stop re\\ufffemembering Joseph, until you have ruined \\nyour health, or you have passed away.”\\n86. He said, “I only complain of my grief and \\nsorrow to Allah, and I know from Allah what \\nyou do not know.”\\n87. “O my sons, go and inquire about Joseph \\nand his brother, and do not despair of Allah's \\ncomfort. None despairs of Allah's comfort \\nexcept the disbelieving people.”\\n88. Then, when they entered into his presence, \\nthey said, “Mighty governor, adversity has \\nbefallen us, and our family. We have brought \\nscant merchandise. But give us full measure, \\nand be charitable towards us—Allah rewards \\nthe charitable.”\\n89. He said, “Do you realize what you did with \\nJoseph and his brother, in your ignorance?”\\n90. They said, “Is that you, Joseph?” He said, “I \\nam Joseph, and this is my brother. Allah has \\nbeen gracious to us. He who practices piety \\nand patience—Allah never fails to reward the \\nrighteous.”\\n91. They said, “By Allah, Allah has preferred \\nyou over us. We were definitely in the \\nwrong.”\\n92. He said, “There is no blame upon you to\\ufffeday. Allah will forgive you. He is the Most \\nMerciful of the merciful.”\\n93. “Take this shirt of mine, and lay it over my \\nfather’s face, and he will recover his sight. \\nAnd bring your whole family to me.”\\n94. As the caravan set out, their father said, “I \\nsense the presence of Joseph, though you may \\nthink I am senile.”\\n95. They said, “By Allah, you are still in your \\nold confusion.”\\n96. Then, when the bearer of good news ar\\uffferived, he laid it over his face, and he regained \\nhis sight. He said, “Did I not say to you that I \\nknow from Allah what you do not know?”\\n97. They said, “Father, pray for the forgiveness \\nof our sins; we were indeed at fault.”\\n98. He said, “I will ask my Lord to forgive you. \\nHe is the Forgiver, the Most Merciful.”\\n99. Then, when they entered into the presence \\nof Joseph, he embraced his parents, and said, \\n“Enter Egypt, Allah willing, safe and secure.”\\n100. And he elevated his parents on the throne, \\nand they fell prostrate before him. He said, \\n“Father, this is the fulfillment of my vision of \\nlong ago. My Lord has made it come true. He \\nhas blessed me, when he released me from \\nprison, and brought you out of the wilder\\ufffeness, after the devil had sown conflict be\\ufffetween me and my brothers. My Lord is Most \\nKind towards whomever He wills. He is the \\nAll-knowing, the Most Wise.”\\n101. “My Lord, You have given me some au\\ufffethority, and taught me some interpretation of \\nevents. Initiator of the heavens and the earth; \\nYou are my Protector in this life and in the \\nHereafter. Receive my soul in submission, \\nand unite me with the righteous.”\\n102. This is news from the past that We reveal \\nto you. You were not present with them when \\nthey plotted and agreed on a plan.\\n103. But most people, for all your eagerness, are \\nnot believers.\\n104. You ask them no wage for it. It is only a \\nreminder for all mankind.\\n105. How many a sign in the heavens and the \\nearth do they pass by, paying no attention to \\nthem?\\n106. And most of them do not believe in Allah \\nunless they associate others.\\n107. Do they feel secure that a covering of Al\\ufffelah’s punishment will not come upon them, \\nor that the Hour will not come upon them \\nsuddenly, while they are unaware?\\n108. Say, “This is my way; I invite to Allah, \\nbased on clear knowledge—I and whoever \\n88\\n13. THUNDER (ar-Ra’d)\\nfollows me. Glory be to Allah; and I am not \\nof the polytheists.”\\n109. We did not send before you except men, \\nwhom We inspired, from the people of the \\ntowns. Have they not roamed the earth and \\nseen the consequences for those before them? \\nThe Home of the Hereafter is better for those \\nwho are righteous. Do you not understand?\\n110. Until, when the messengers have des\\ufffepaired, and thought that they were rejected, \\nOur help came to them. We save whomever \\nWe will, and Our severity is not averted from \\nthe guilty people.\\n111. In their stories is a lesson for those who \\npossess intelligence. This is not a fabricated \\ntale, but a confirmation of what came before \\nit, and a detailed explanation of all things, \\nand guidance, and mercy for people who be\\ufffelieve.\\n13. THUNDER\\n(ar-Ra’d)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Alif, Lam, Meem, Ra. These are the signs of \\nthe Scripture. What is revealed to you from \\nyour Lord is the truth, but most people do not \\nbelieve.\\n2. Allah is He who raised the heavens without \\npillars that you can see, and then settled on \\nthe Throne. And He regulated the sun and \\nthe moon, each running for a specified pe\\uffferiod. He manages all affairs, and He explains \\nthe signs, that you may be certain of the meet\\ufffeing with your Lord.\\n3. And it is He who spread the earth, and \\nplaced in it mountains and rivers. And He \\nplaced in it two kinds of every fruit. He causes \\nthe night to overlap the day. In that are signs \\nfor people who reflect.\\n4. On earth are adjacent terrains, and gardens \\nof vines, and crops, and date-palms, from the \\nsame root or from distinct roots, irrigated \\nwith the same water. We make some taste \\nbetter than others. In that are proofs for peo\\ufffeple who reason.\\n5. Should you wonder—the real wonder is \\ntheir saying: “When we have become dust, \\nwill we be in a new creation?” Those are they \\nwho defied their Lord. Those are they who \\nwill have yokes around their necks. Those are \\nthe inhabitants of the Fire, where they will re\\ufffemain forever.\\n6. And they urge you to hasten evil before \\ngood, though examples have passed away be\\ufffefore them. Your Lord is full of forgiveness to\\ufffewards the people for their wrongdoings, yet \\nyour Lord is severe in retribution.\\n7. Those who disbelieve say, “Why was a mir\\ufffeacle not sent down to him from his Lord?” \\nYou are only a warner, and to every commu\\ufffenity is a guide.\\n8. Allah knows what every female bears, and \\nevery increase and decrease of the wombs. \\nWith Him, everything is by measure.\\n9. The Knower of the Invisible and the Visible; \\nthe Grand, the Supreme.\\n10. It is the same; whether one of you conceals \\nhis speech, or declares it; whether he goes \\ninto hiding by night, or goes out by day.\\n11. He has a succession; before him and behind \\nhim, protecting him by Allah’s command. \\nAllah does not change the condition of a peo\\ufffeple until they change what is within them\\ufffeselves. And if Allah wills any hardship for a \\npeople, there is no turning it back; and apart \\nfrom Him they have no protector.\\n12. It is He who shows you the lightening, \\ncausing fear and hope. And He produces the \\nheavy clouds.\\n13. The thunder praises His glory, and so do \\nthe angels, in awe of Him. And He sends the \\nthunderbolts, striking with them whomever \\nHe wills. Yet they argue about Allah, while \\nHe is Tremendous in might.\\n14. To Him belongs the call to truth. Those \\nthey call upon besides Him do not respond to \\nthem with anything—except as someone who \\nstretches his hands towards water, so that it \\n89\\n13. THUNDER (ar-Ra’d)\\nmay reach his mouth, but it does not reach it. \\nThe prayers of the unbelievers are only in \\nvain.\\n15. To Allah prostrates everyone in the heav\\ufffeens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly, as \\ndo their shadows, in the morning and in the \\nevening.\\n16. Say, “Who is the Lord of the heavens and \\nthe earth?” Say, “Allah.” Say, “Have you taken \\nbesides Him protectors, who have no power \\nto profit or harm even themselves?” Say, “Are \\nthe blind and the seeing equal? Or are dark\\ufffeness and light equal? Or have they assigned to \\nAllah associates, who created the likes of His \\ncreation, so that the creations seemed to \\nthem alike? Say, “Allah is the Creator of all \\nthings, and He is The One, the Irresistible.”\\n17. He sends down water from the sky, and riv\\ufffeerbeds flow according to their capacity. The \\ncurrent carries swelling froth. And from what \\nthey heat in fire of ornaments or utensils \\ncomes a similar froth. Thus Allah exemplifies \\ntruth and falsehood. As for the froth, it is \\nswept away, but what benefits the people re\\ufffemains in the ground. Thus Allah presents the \\nanalogies.\\n18. For those who respond to their Lord is the \\nbest. But as for those who do not respond to \\nHim, even if they possessed everything on \\nearth, and twice as much, they could not re\\ufffedeem themselves with it. Those will have the \\nworst reckoning; and their home is Hell—a \\nmiserable destination.\\n19. Is he who knows that what was revealed to \\nyour from your Lord is the truth, like him \\nwho is blind? Only those who reason will re\\ufffemember.\\n20. Those who fulfill the promise to Allah, and \\ndo not violate the agreement. \\n21. And those who join what Allah has com\\ufffemanded to be joined, and fear their Lord, and \\ndread the dire reckoning.\\n22. And those who patiently seek the presence \\nof their Lord, and pray regularly, and spend \\nfrom Our provisions to them, secretly and \\nopenly, and repel evil with good. These will \\nhave the Ultimate Home.\\n23. Everlasting Gardens, which they will enter, \\nalong with the righteous among their par\\ufffeents, and their spouses, and their descend\\ufffeants. And the angels will enter upon them \\nfrom every gate.\\n24. “Peace be upon you, because you endured \\npatiently. How excellent is the Final Home.”\\n25. As for those who violate the promise to Al\\ufffelah, after pledging to keep it, and sever what \\nAllah has commanded to be joined, and \\nspread corruption on earth—these, the curse \\nwill be upon them, and they will have the \\nWorst Home.\\n26. Allah dispenses the provisions to whom\\ufffeever He wills, and restricts. And they delight \\nin the worldly life; yet the worldly life, com\\ufffepared to the Hereafter, is only enjoyment.\\n27. Those who disbelieve say, “If only a miracle \\nwas sent down to him from his Lord.” Say, \\n“Allah leads astray whomever He wills, and \\nHe guides to Himself whoever repents.”\\n28. Those who believe, and whose hearts find \\ncomfort in the remembrance of Allah. Surely, \\nit is in the remembrance of Allah that hearts \\nfind comfort.”\\n29. For those who believe and do righteous \\ndeeds—for them is happiness and a beautiful \\nreturn.\\n30. Thus We sent you among a community be\\ufffefore which other communities have passed \\naway, that you may recite to them what We \\nrevealed to you. Yet they deny the Benevolent \\nOne. Say, “He is my Lord; there is no god but \\nHe; in Him I trust, and to Him is my repent\\ufffeance.”\\n31. Even if there were a Quran, by which \\nmountains could be set in motion, or by \\nwhich the earth could be shattered, or by \\nwhich the dead could be made to speak. In \\nfact, every decision rests with Allah. Did the \\nbelievers not give up and realize that had Al\\ufffelah willed, He would have guided all human\\ufffeity? Disasters will continue to strike those \\nwho disbelieve, because of their deeds, or\\n90\\n14. ABRAHAM (Ibrahim)\\nthey fall near their homes, until Allah’s \\npromise comes true. Allah never breaks a \\npromise.\\n32. Messengers before you were ridiculed, but \\nI granted the disbelievers respite, and then I \\nseized them. What a punishment it was!\\n33. Is He who is watchful over the deeds of \\nevery soul? Yet they ascribe associates to Al\\ufffelah. Say, “Name them! Or are you informing \\nHim of something on earth He does not \\nknow, or is it a show of words?” In fact, the \\nscheming of those who disbelieve is made to \\nappear good to them, and they are averted \\nfrom the path. Whomever Allah misguides \\nhas no guide.\\n34. There is for them torment in the worldly \\nlife, but the torment of the Hereafter is \\nharsher. And they have no defender against \\nAllah. \\n35. The likeness of the Garden promised to the \\nrighteous: rivers flowing beneath it; its food \\nis perpetual, and so is its shade. Such is the \\nsequel for those who guard against evil, but \\nthe sequel of the disbelievers is the Fire.\\n36. Those to whom We gave the Scripture re\\ufffejoice in what was revealed to you, while some \\nfactions reject parts of it. Say, “I am com\\ufffemanded to worship Allah, and to never asso\\ufffeciate anything with Him. To Him I invite, \\nand to Him is my return.”\\n37. Thus We revealed it an Arabic code of law. \\nWere you to follow their desires, after the\\nknowledge that has come to you, you would \\nhave neither ally nor defender against Allah.\\n38. We sent messengers before you, and We \\nassigned for them wives and offspring. No \\nmessenger could bring a sign except with the \\npermission of Allah. For every era is a scrip\\ufffeture.\\n39. Allah abolishes whatever He wills, and He \\naffirms. With Him is the source of the Scrip\\ufffeture.\\n40. Whether We show you some of what We \\nhave promised them, or We cause you to \\ndie—your duty is to inform, and Ours is the \\nreckoning.\\n41. Do they not see how We deal with the \\nearth, diminishing it at its edges? Allah \\njudges; and nothing can hold back His judg\\ufffement. And He is quick to settle accounts.\\n42. Those before them planned, but the entire \\nplan is up to Allah. He knows what every soul \\nearns. Those who disbelieve will know to \\nwhom the Ultimate Home is.\\n43. Those who disbelieve say, “You are not a \\nmessenger.” Say, “Allah is a sufficient witness \\nbetween me and you, and whoever has \\nknowledge of the Scripture.”\\n14. ABRAHAM\\n(Ibrahim)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Alif, Lam, Ra. A Scripture that We revealed \\nto you, that you may bring humanity from \\ndarkness to light—with the permission of \\ntheir Lord—to the path of the Almighty, the \\nPraiseworthy.\\n2. Allah—to whom belongs what is in the \\nheavens and the earth. And woe to the disbe\\ufffelievers from a severe torment.\\n3. Those who prefer the present life to the \\nHereafter, and repel from the path of Allah, \\nand seek to make it crooked—these are far \\nastray.\\n4. We never sent any messenger except in the \\nlanguage of his people, to make things clear \\nfor them. Allah leads astray whom He wills, \\nand guides whom He wills. He is the Mighty, \\nthe Wise.\\n5. We sent Moses with Our signs: “Bring your \\npeople out of darkness into light, and remind \\nthem of the Days of Allah.” In that are signs \\nfor every patient and thankful person.”\\n6. Moses said to his people, “Remember Al\\ufffelah’s blessings upon you, as He delivered you \\nfrom the people of Pharaoh, who inflicted on \\nyou terrible suffering, slaughtering your sons \\nwhile sparing your daughters. In that was a \\nserious trial from your Lord.”\\n91\\n14. ABRAHAM (Ibrahim)\\n7. And when your Lord proclaimed: “If you \\ngive thanks, I will grant you increase; but if \\nyou are ungrateful, My punishment is se\\ufffevere.”\\n8. And Moses said, “Even if you are ungrate\\ufffeful, together with everyone on earth—Allah is \\nin no need, Worthy of Praise.”\\n9. Has not the story reached you, of those be\\ufffefore you, the people of Noah, and Aad, and \\nThamood—and those after them? None \\nknows them except Allah. Their messengers \\ncame to them with the clear proofs, but they \\ntried to silence them, and said, “We reject \\nwhat you are sent with, and we are in serious \\ndoubt regarding what you are calling us to.”\\n10. Their messengers said, “Is there any doubt \\nabout Allah, Maker of the heavens and the \\nearth? He calls you to forgive you your sins, \\nand to defer you until a stated term.” They \\nsaid, “You are only humans like us; you want \\nto turn us away from what our ancestors wor\\ufffeshiped; so bring us a clear proof.”\\n11. Their messengers said to them, “We are \\nonly humans like you, but Allah favors \\nwhomever He wills from among His servants. \\nWe cannot possibly show you any proof, ex\\ufffecept by leave of Allah. In Allah let the faithful \\nput their trust.”\\n12. “And why should we not trust in Allah, \\nwhen He has guided us in our ways? We will \\npersevere in the face of your persecution. \\nAnd upon Allah the reliant should rely.”\\n13. Those who disbelieved said to their mes\\ufffesengers, “We will expel you from our land, \\nunless you return to our religion.” And their \\nLord inspired them: “We will destroy the \\nwrongdoers.”\\n14. “And We will settle you in the land after \\nthem. That is for him who fears My Majesty, \\nand fears My threats.”\\n15. And they prayed for victory, and every \\nstubborn tyrant came to disappointment.\\n16. Beyond him lies Hell, and he will be given \\nto drink putrid water.\\n17. He will guzzle it, but he will not swallow it. \\nDeath will come at him from every direction, \\nbut he will not die. And beyond this is relent\\ufffeless suffering.\\n18. The likeness of those who disbelieve in \\ntheir Lord: their works are like ashes, in a \\nfierce wind, on a stormy day. They have no \\ncontrol over anything they have earned. That \\nis the utmost misguidance.\\n19. Do you not see that Allah created the heav\\ufffeens and the earth with truth? If He wills, He \\ncan do away with you, and bring a new crea\\ufffetion.\\n20. And that is not difficult for Allah.\\n21. They will emerge before Allah, altogether. \\nThe weak will say to those who were proud, \\n“We were your followers, can you protect us \\nat all against Allah’s punishment?” They will \\nsay, “Had Allah guided us, we would have \\nguided you. It is the same for us; whether we \\nmourn, or are patient; there is no asylum for \\nus.”\\n22. And Satan will say, when the issue is set\\ufffetled, “Allah has promised you the promise of \\ntruth, and I promised you, but I failed you. I \\nhad no authority over you, except that I called \\nyou, and you answered me. So do not blame \\nme, but blame yourselves. I cannot come to \\nyour aid, nor can you come to my aid. I reject \\nyour associating with me in the past. The \\nwrongdoers will have a torment most pain\\ufffeful.”\\n23. But those who believed and did good deeds \\nwill be admitted into gardens beneath which \\nrivers flow, to remain therein forever, by \\nleave of their Lord. Their greeting therein will \\nbe: “Peace.”\\n24. Do you not see how Allah presents a para\\ufffeble? A good word is like a good tree—its root \\nis firm, and its branches are in the sky.\\n25. It yields its fruits every season by the will of \\nits Lord. Allah presents the parables to the \\npeople, so that they may reflect. \\n26. And the parable of a bad word is that of a \\nbad tree—it is uprooted from the ground; it \\nhas no stability.\\n92\\n14. ABRAHAM (Ibrahim)\\n27. Allah gives firmness to those who believe, \\nwith the firm word, in this life, and in the \\nHereafter. And Allah leads the wicked astray. \\nAllah does whatever He wills.\\n28. Have you not seen those who exchanged \\nthe blessing of Allah with blasphemy, and \\nlanded their people into the house of perdi\\ufffetion?\\n29. Hell—they will roast in it. What a misera\\ufffeble settlement.\\n30. And they set up rivals to Allah, in order to \\nlead away from His path. Say, “Enjoy your\\ufffeselves; your destination is the Fire.”\\n31. Tell My servants who have believed to per\\ufffeform the prayers, and to give from what We \\nhave given them, secretly and publicly, before \\na Day comes in which there is neither trading \\nnor friendship.\\n32. Allah is He Who created the heavens and \\nthe earth, and sends down water from the \\nsky, and with it produces fruits for your sus\\ufffetenance. And He committed the ships to your \\nservice, sailing through the sea by His com\\ufffemand, and He committed the rivers to your \\nservice.\\n33. And He committed the sun and the moon \\nto your service, both continuously pursuing \\ntheir courses, and He committed the night \\nand the day to your service.\\n34. And He has given you something of all \\nwhat you asked. And if you were to count Al\\ufffelah’s blessings, you would not be able to enu\\ufffemerate them. The human being is unfair and \\nungrateful.\\n35. Recall that Abraham said, “O my Lord, \\nmake this land peaceful, and keep me and my \\nsons from worshiping idols.”\\n36. “My Lord, they have led many people \\nastray. Whoever follows me belongs with me; \\nand whoever disobeys me—You are Forgiv\\ufffeing and Merciful.\\n37. “Our Lord, I have settled some of my off\\ufffespring in a valley of no vegetation, by Your \\nSacred House, our Lord, so that they may \\nperform the prayers. So make the hearts of \\nsome people incline towards them, and pro\\ufffevide them with fruits, that they may be thank\\ufffeful.”\\n38. “Our Lord, You know what we conceal and \\nwhat we reveal. And nothing is hidden from \\nAllah, on earth or in the heaven.”\\n39. “Praise be to Allah, Who has given me, in \\nmy old age, Ishmael and Isaac. My Lord is the \\nHearer of Prayers.”\\n40. “My Lord, make me one who performs the \\nprayer, and from my offspring. Our Lord, ac\\ufffecept my supplication.”\\n41. “Our Lord, forgive me, and my parents, \\nand the believers, on the Day the Reckoning \\ntakes place.”\\n42. Do not ever think that Allah is unaware of \\nwhat the wrongdoers do. He only defers them \\nuntil a Day when the sights stare.\\n43. Their necks outstretched, their heads up\\uffferaised, their gaze unblinking, their hearts \\nvoid.\\n44. And warn mankind of the Day when the \\npunishment will come upon them, and the \\nwicked will say, “Our Lord, defer us for a little \\nwhile, and we will answer Your call and fol\\ufffelow the messengers.” Did you not swear be\\ufffefore that there will be no passing away for \\nyou?\\n45. And you inhabited the homes of those who \\nwronged themselves, and it became clear to \\nyou how We dealt with them, and We cited \\nfor you the examples.\\n46. They planned their plans, but their plans \\nare known to Allah, even if their plans can \\neliminate mountains.\\n47. Do not ever think that Allah will break His \\npromise to His messengers. Allah is Strong, \\nAble to Avenge.\\n48. On the Day when the earth is changed into \\nanother earth, and the heavens, and they will \\nemerge before Allah, the One, the Irresistible.\\n49. On that Day, you will see the sinners bound \\ntogether in chains. \\n93\\n15. THE ROCK (al-Hijr)\\n50. Their garments made of tar, and the Fire \\ncovering their faces.\\n51. That Allah may repay each soul according \\nto what it has earned. Allah is Quick in reck\\ufffeoning.\\n52. This is a proclamation for mankind, that \\nthey may be warned thereby, and know that \\nHe is One God, and that people of under\\ufffestanding may remember.\\n15. THE ROCK\\n(al-Hijr)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Alif, Lam, Ra. These are the Verses of the \\nBook; a Quran that makes things clear.\\n2. Perhaps those who disbelieve would like to \\nbecome Muslims. \\n3. Leave them to eat, and enjoy, and be lulled \\nby hope. They will find out.\\n4. We have never destroyed a town unless it \\nhad a set time.\\n5. No nation can bring its time forward, nor \\ncan they delay it.\\n6. And they said, “O you who received the \\nmessage, you are insane.”\\n7. Why do you not bring us the angels, if you \\nare truthful?”\\n8. We do not send the angels down except \\nwith reason, and they will not be held back.\\n9. Surely We revealed the Message, and We \\nwill surely preserve it. \\n10. We sent others before you, to the former \\ncommunities.\\n11. But no messenger came to them, but they \\nridiculed him.\\n12. Thus We slip it into the hearts of the guilty.\\n13. They do not believe in it, though the ways \\nof the ancients have passed away.\\n14. Even if We opened for them a gateway into \\nthe sky, and they began to ascend through it.\\n15. They would still say, “Our eyes are halluci\\ufffenating; in fact, we are people bewitched.”\\n16. We placed constellations in the sky, and \\nmade them beautiful to the beholders.\\n17. And We guarded them from every outcast \\ndevil.\\n18. Except one who steals a hearing, and is fol\\ufffelowed by a visible projectile.\\n19. We spread the earth, and placed stabilizers \\nin it, and in it We grew all things in proper \\nmeasure.\\n20. And in it We created livelihoods for you, \\nand for those for whom you are not the pro\\ufffeviders.\\n21. There is not a thing but with Us are its \\nstores, and We send it down only in precise \\nmeasure.\\n22. We send the fertilizing winds; and send \\ndown water from the sky, and give it to you \\nto drink, and you are not the ones who store \\nit.\\n23. It is We who give life and cause death, and \\nWe are the Inheritors.\\n24. And We know those of you who go for\\ufffeward, and We know those who lag behind.\\n25. It is your Lord who will gather them to\\ufffegether. He is the Wise, the Knowing.\\n26. We created the human being from clay, \\nfrom molded mud.\\n27. And the jinn We created before, from \\npiercing fire.\\n28. Your Lord said to the angels, “I am creating \\na human being from clay, from molded \\nmud.”\\n29. “When I have formed him, and breathed \\ninto him of My spirit, fall down prostrating \\nbefore him.”\\n30. So the angels prostrated themselves, all to\\ufffegether.\\n31. Except for Satan. He refused to be among \\nthose who prostrated themselves.\\n94\\n15. THE ROCK (al-Hijr)\\n32. He said, “O Satan, what kept you from be\\ufffeing among those who prostrated them\\ufffeselves?”\\n33. He said, “I am not about to prostrate my\\ufffeself before a human being, whom You created \\nfrom clay, from molded mud.”\\n34. He said, “Then get out of here, for you are \\nan outcast”.\\n35. “And the curse will be upon you until the \\nDay of Judgment.”\\n36. He said, “My Lord, reprieve me until the \\nDay they are resurrected.”\\n37. He said, “You are of those reprieved.”\\n38. “Until the Day of the time appointed.”\\n39. He said, “My Lord, since You have lured \\nme away, I will glamorize for them on earth, \\nand I will lure them all away.”\\n40. “Except for Your sincere servants among \\nthem.”\\n41. He said, “This is a right way with Me.”\\n42. “Over My servants you have no authority, \\nexcept for the sinners who follow you.”\\n43. And Hell is the meeting-place for them all. \\n44. “It has seven doors; for each door is an as\\ufffesigned class.”\\n45. But the righteous will be in gardens with \\nsprings. \\n46. “Enter it in peace and security.”\\n47. And We will remove all ill-feelings from \\ntheir hearts—brothers and sisters, on \\ncouches facing one another.\\n48. No fatigue will ever touch them therein, \\nnor will they be asked to leave it.\\n49. Inform My servants that I am the Forgiver, \\nthe Merciful.\\n50. And that My punishment is the painful \\npunishment.\\n51. And inform them of the guests of Abra\\ufffeham. \\n52. When they entered upon him, and said, \\n“Peace.” He said, “We are wary of you.”\\n53. They said, “Do not fear; we bring you good \\nnews of a boy endowed with knowledge.”\\n54. He said, “Do you bring me good news, \\nwhen old age has overtaken me? What good \\nnews do you bring?”\\n55. They said, “We bring you good news in \\ntruth, so do not despair.”\\n56. He said, “And who despairs of his Lord’s \\nmercy but the lost?”\\n57. He said, “So what is your business, O en\\ufffevoys?”\\n58. They said, “We were sent to a sinful peo\\ufffeple.”\\n59. “Except for the family of Lot; we will save \\nthem all.”\\n60. “Except for his wife.” We have determined \\nthat she will be of those who lag behind.\\n61. And when the envoys came to the family of \\nLot.\\n62. He said, “You are a people unknown to \\nme.”\\n63. They said, “We bring you what they have \\ndoubts about.”\\n64. “We bring you the truth, and we are truth\\ufffeful.”\\n65. “Travel with your family at the dead of the \\nnight, and follow up behind them, and let \\nnone of you look back, and proceed as com\\ufffemanded.”\\n66. And We informed him of Our decree: the \\nlast remnant of these will be uprooted by \\nearly morning.\\n67. And the people of the town came joyfully.\\n68. He said, “These are my guests, so do not \\nembarrass me.”\\n69. “And fear Allah, and do not disgrace me.”\\n70. They said, “Did we not forbid you from \\nstrangers?”\\n71. He said, “These are my daughters, if you \\nmust.”\\n72. By your life, they were blundering in their \\ndrunkenness.\\n95\\n16. THE BEE (an-Nahl)\\n73. So the Blast struck them at sunrise.\\n74. And We turned it upside down, and rained \\ndown upon them stones of baked clay.\\n75. Surely in that are lessons for those who \\nread signs.\\n76. And it is on an existing road.\\n77. Surely in that is a sign for the believers.\\n78. The people of the Woods were also wrong\\ufffedoers.\\n79. So We took revenge upon them. Both are \\nclearly documented.\\n80. The people of the Rock also rejected the \\nmessengers.\\n81. We gave them Our revelations, but they \\nturned away from them.\\n82. They used to carve homes in the moun\\ufffetains, feeling secure.\\n83. But the Blast struck them in the morning.\\n84. All they had acquired was of no avail to \\nthem. \\n85. We did not create the heavens and the \\nearth, and what lies between them, except \\nwith truth. The Hour is coming, so forgive \\nwith gracious forgiveness.\\n86. Your Lord is the All-Knowing Creator.\\n87. We have given you seven of the pairs, and \\nthe Grand Quran.\\n88. Do not extend your eyes towards what We \\nhave bestowed on some couples of them to \\nenjoy, and do not grieve over them, and lower \\nyour wing to the believers.\\n89. And say, “I am the clear warner.”\\n90. Just as We sent down to the separatists.\\n91. Those who made the Quran obsolete.\\n92. By your Lord, we will question them all.\\n93. About what they used to do.\\n94. So proclaim openly what you are com\\ufffemanded, and turn away from the polytheists.\\n95. We are enough for you against the mock\\ufffeers.\\n96. Those who set up another god with Allah. \\nThey will come to know.\\n97. We are aware that your heart is strained by \\nwhat they say.\\n98. So glorify the praise of your Lord, and be \\namong those who bow down.\\n99. And worship your Lord in order to attain \\ncertainty.\\n16. THE BEE\\n(an-Nahl)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. The command of Allah has come, so do not \\nrush it. Glory be to Him; exalted above what \\nthey associate.\\n2. He sends down the angels with the Spirit by \\nHis command, upon whom He wills of His \\nservants: “Give warning that there is no god \\nbut Me, and fear Me.”\\n3. He created the heavens and the earth with \\njustice. He is exalted above the associations \\nthey attribute.\\n4. He created the human being from a drop of \\nfluid, yet he becomes an open adversary.\\n5. And the livestock—He created them for \\nyou. In them are warmth and benefits for \\nyou, and of them you eat.\\n6. And there is beauty in them for you, when \\nyou bring them home, and when you drive \\nthem to pasture.\\n7. And they carry your loads to territory you \\ncould not have reached without great hard\\ufffeship. Your Lord is Clement and Merciful.\\n8. And the horses, and the mules, and the don\\ufffekeys—for you to ride, and for luxury. And He \\ncreates what you do not know.\\n9. It is for Allah to point out the paths, but \\nsome of them are flawed. Had He willed, He \\ncould have guided you all.\\n96\\n16. THE BEE (an-Nahl)\\n10. It is He Who sends down for you from the \\nsky water. From it is drink, and with it grows \\nvegetation for grazing.\\n11. And He produces for you grains with it, \\nand olives, and date-palms, and grapes, and \\nall kinds of fruits. Surely in that is a sign for \\npeople who think. \\n12. And He regulated for you the night and the \\nday; and the sun, and the moon, and the stars \\nare disposed by His command. Surely in that \\nare signs for people who ponder.\\n13. And whatsoever He created for you on \\nearth is of diverse colors. Surely in that is a \\nsign for people who are mindful.\\n14. And it is He who made the sea to serve you, \\nthat you may eat from it tender meat, and ex\\ufffetract from it ornaments that you wear. And \\nyou see the ships plowing through it, as you \\nseek His bounties, so that you may give \\nthanks.\\n15. And he cast mountains on the earth, lest it \\nshifts with you; and rivers, and roads, so that \\nyou may be guided.\\n16. And landmarks. And by the stars they \\nguide themselves.\\n17. Is He who creates like him who does not \\ncreate? Will you not take a lesson?\\n18. And if you tried to enumerate the favors of \\nAllah, you will not be able to count them. Al\\ufffelah is Forgiving and Merciful.\\n19. And Allah knows what you hide and what \\nyou disclose.\\n20. Those they invoke besides Allah create \\nnothing, but are themselves created.\\n21. They are dead, not alive; and they do not \\nknow when they will be resurrected.\\n22. Your God is one God. As for those who do \\nnot believe in the Hereafter, their hearts are \\nin denial, and they are arrogant.\\n23. Without a doubt, Allah knows what they \\nconceal and what they reveal. He does not \\nlike the arrogant.\\n24. And when it is said to them, “What has \\nyour Lord sent down?” They say, “Legends of \\nthe ancients.”\\n25. So let them carry their loads complete on \\nthe Day of Resurrection, and some of the \\nloads of those they misguided without \\nknowledge. Evil is what they carry.\\n26. Those before them also schemed, but Allah \\ntook their structures from the foundations, \\nand the roof caved in on them. The punish\\ufffement came at them from where they did not \\nperceive.\\n27. Then, on the Day of Resurrection, He will \\ndisgrace them, and say, “Where are My asso\\ufffeciates for whose sake you used to dispute?” \\nThose who were given knowledge will say, \\n“Today shame and misery are upon the dis\\ufffebelievers.”\\n28. Those wronging their souls while the an\\ufffegels are taking them away—they will propose \\npeace: “We did no wrong.” Yes you did. Allah \\nis aware of what you used to do.”\\n29. Enter the gates of Hell, to dwell therein for\\ufffeever. Miserable is the residence of the arro\\ufffegant.\\n30. And it will be said to those who maintained \\npiety, “What has your Lord revealed?” They \\nwill say, “Goodness.” To those who do good \\nin this world is goodness, and the Home of \\nthe Hereafter is even better. How wonderful \\nis the residence of the pious.\\n31. The Gardens of Perpetuity, which they will \\nenter, beneath which rivers flow, where they \\nwill have whatever they desire. Thus Allah re\\ufffewards the pious.\\n32. Those who are in a wholesome state when \\nthe angels take them—will say, “Peace be \\nupon you; enter Paradise, for what you used \\nto do.”\\n33. Are they but waiting for the angels to come \\nto them, or for the command of your Lord to \\narrive? Those before them did likewise. Allah \\ndid not wrong them, but they used to wrong \\ntheir own souls.\\n97\\n16. THE BEE (an-Nahl)\\n34. So the evils of their deeds assailed them, \\nand what they used to ridicule engulfed them.\\n35. The idolaters say, “Had Allah willed, we \\nwould not have worshiped anything besides \\nHim, neither us, nor our ancestors, nor \\nwould we have prohibited anything besides \\nHis prohibitions.” Those before them did \\nlikewise. Are the messengers responsible for\\nanything but clear communication?\\n36. To every community We sent a messenger: \\n“Worship Allah, and avoid idolatry.” Some of \\nthem Allah guided, while others deserved \\nmisguidance. So travel through the earth, and \\nsee what the fate of the deniers was.\\n37. Even though you may be concerned about \\ntheir guidance, Allah does not guide those \\nwho misguide. And they will have no saviors.\\n38. And they swear by Allah with their most \\nsolemn oaths, “Allah will not resurrect any\\ufffeone who dies.” Yes indeed, it is a promise \\nbinding on Him, but most people do not \\nknow.\\n39. To clarify for them what they differed \\nabout, and for the faithless to know that they \\nwere liars.\\n40. When We intend for something to happen, \\nWe say to it, “Be,” and it becomes.\\n41. Those who emigrate for Allah’s sake after \\nbeing persecuted, We will settle them in a \\ngood place in this world; but the reward of \\nthe Hereafter is greater, if they only knew.\\n42. Those who endure patiently, and in their \\nLord they put their trust.\\n43. We did not send before you except men \\nwhom We inspired. So ask the people of \\nknowledge, if you do not know.\\n44. With the clarifications and the scriptures. \\nAnd We revealed to you the Reminder, that \\nyou may clarify to the people what was re\\ufffevealed to them, and that they may reflect.\\n45. Do those who scheme evils feel secure that \\nAllah will not cause the earth to cave in with \\nthem, or that the punishment will not come \\nupon them from where they do not perceive?\\n46. Or that He will not seize them during their \\nactivities? And they will not be able to pre\\ufffevent it.\\n47. Or that He will not seize them while in \\ndread? Your Lord is Gentle and Merciful.\\n48. Have they not observed what Allah has cre\\ufffeated? Their shadows revolve from the right \\nand the left, bowing to Allah as they shrink \\naway.\\n49. To Allah bows down everything in the \\nheavens and everything on earth—every liv\\ufffeing creature, and the angels, and without be\\ufffeing proud.\\n50. They fear their Lord above them, and they \\ndo what they are commanded.\\n51. Allah has said: “Do not take two gods; He \\nis only One God; so fear only Me.”\\n52. To Him belongs everything in the heavens \\nand the earth; and to Him obedience is due \\nalways. Do you, then, fear anyone other than \\nAllah?\\n53. Whatever blessing you have is from Allah. \\nAnd when harm touches you, it is to Him that \\nyou groan.\\n54. But when He lifts the harm from you, some \\nof you associate others with their Lord.\\n55. To show ingratitude for what We have \\ngiven them. Enjoy yourselves. You will soon \\nknow.\\n56. And they allocate, to something they do \\nnot know, a share of what We have provided \\nfor them. By Allah, you will be questioned \\nabout what you have been inventing.\\n57. And they attribute to Allah daughters—ex\\ufffealted is He—and for themselves what they de\\ufffesire.\\n58. And when one of them is given news of a \\nfemale infant, his face darkens, and he chokes \\nwith grief.\\n59. He hides from the people because of the \\nbad news given to him. Shall he keep it in hu\\ufffemiliation, or bury it in the dust? Evil is the \\ndecision they make.\\n98\\n16. THE BEE (an-Nahl)\\n60. Those who do not believe in the Hereafter \\nset a bad example, while Allah sets the High\\ufffeest Example. He is the Mighty, the Wise.\\n61. If Allah were to hold mankind for their in\\ufffejustices, He would not leave upon it a single \\ncreature, but He postpones them until an ap\\ufffepointed time. Then, when their time arrives, \\nthey will not delay it by one hour, nor will \\nthey advance it.\\n62. And they attribute to Allah what they \\nthemselves dislike, while their tongues utter \\nthe lie that theirs is the goodness. Without a \\ndoubt, for them is the Fire, and they will be \\nneglected.\\n63. By Allah, We sent messengers to commu\\ufffenities before you, but Satan made their deeds \\nappear alluring to them. He is their master \\ntoday, and they will have a painful punish\\ufffement.\\n64. We revealed to you the Scripture only to \\nclarify for them what they differ about, and \\nguidance and mercy for people who believe.\\n65. Allah sends down water from the sky, with \\nwhich He revives the earth after its death. In \\nthis is a sign for people who listen.\\n66. And there is a lesson for you in cattle: We \\ngive you a drink from their bellies, from be\\ufffetween waste and blood, pure milk, refreshing \\nto the drinkers.\\n67. And from the fruits of date-palms and \\ngrapevines, you derive sugar and wholesome \\nfood. In this is a sign for people who under\\ufffestand.\\n68. And your Lord inspired the bee: “Set up \\nhives in the mountains, and in the trees, and \\nin what they construct.”\\n69. Then eat of all the fruits, and go along the \\npathways of your Lord, with precision. From \\ntheir bellies emerges a fluid of diverse colors, \\ncontaining healing for the people. Surely in \\nthis is a sign for people who reflect.\\n70. Allah created you; then He takes you away. \\nSome of you will be brought back to the worst \\nage, so that he will no longer know anything, \\nafter having acquired knowledge. Allah is \\nOmniscient and Omnipotent.\\n71. Allah has favored some of you over others \\nin livelihood. Those who are favored would \\nnot give their properties to their servants, to \\nthe extent of making them partners in it. Will \\nthey then renounce Allah’s blessings?\\n72. Allah has given you mates from among \\nyourselves; and has produced for you, from \\nyour mates, children and grandchildren; and \\nhas provided you with good things. Will they \\nthen believe in falsehood, and refuse Allah’s \\nfavors?\\n73. And yet they serve besides Allah what pos\\ufffesesses no provisions for them in the heavens, \\nnor on earth, nor are they capable.\\n74. So do not cite the examples for Allah. Allah \\nknows, and you do not know.\\n75. Allah cites the example of a bonded slave, \\nwho has no power over anything; and some\\ufffeone to whom We have given plentiful provi\\ufffesion, from which he gives secretly and \\nopenly. Are they equal in comparison? All \\npraise belongs to Allah, but most of them do \\nnot know.\\n76. And Allah cites the example of two men: \\none of them dumb, unable to do anything, \\nand is a burden on his master; whichever way \\nhe directs him, he achieves nothing good. Is \\nhe equal to him who commands justice, and \\nis on a straight path?\\n77. To Allah belongs the unseen of the heavens \\nand the earth. The coming of the Hour is only \\nas the twinkling of the eye, or even nearer. Al\\ufffelah has power over everything.\\n78. Allah brought you out of your mothers’ \\nwombs, not knowing anything; and He gave \\nyou the hearing, and the eyesight, and the \\nbrains; that you may give thanks.\\n79. Have they not seen the birds, flying in the \\nmidst of the sky? None sustains them except \\nAllah. In this are signs for people who believe.\\n80. And Allah has given you in your homes \\nhabitats for you, and has provided for you out \\nof the hides of livestock portable homes for \\n99\\n16. THE BEE (an-Nahl)\\nyou, so you can use them when you travel, \\nand when you camp; and from their wool, \\nand fur, and hair, furnishings and comfort \\nfor a while.\\n81. And Allah has made for you shade out of \\nwhat He has created, and has given you re\\ufffesorts in the mountains, and has given you \\ngarments to protect you from the heat, and \\ngarments to protect you from your violence. \\nThus He completes His blessings upon you, \\nso that you may submit.\\n82. But if they turn away, your only duty is \\nclear communication.\\n83. They recognize Allah’s blessing, but then \\ndeny it, as most of them are ungrateful.\\n84. On the Day when We raise up a witness \\nfrom every community—those who disbe\\ufffelieved will not be permitted, nor will they be \\nexcused.\\n85. When those who did wrong see the pun\\ufffeishment, it will not be lightened for them, nor \\nwill they be reprieved.\\n86. And when the idolaters see their associates, \\nthey will say, “Our Lord, these are our associ\\ufffeates whom we used to invoke besides You.” \\nThey will strike back at them with the saying, \\n“Surely you are liars.”\\n87. On that Day they will offer their submis\\ufffesion to Allah, and what they had invented will \\nabandon them.\\n88. Those who disbelieve and obstruct from \\nAllah’s path—We will add punishment to \\ntheir punishment, on account of the mischief \\nthey used to make.\\n89. On the Day when We raise in every com\\ufffemunity a witness against them, from among \\nthem, and bring you as a witness against \\nthese. We have revealed to you the Book, as \\nan explanation of all things, and guidance, \\nand mercy and good news for those who sub\\ufffemit.\\n90. Allah commands justice, and goodness, \\nand generosity towards relatives. And He for\\ufffebids immorality, and injustice, and oppres\\ufffesion. He advises you, so that you may take \\nheed.\\n91. Fulfill Allah’s covenant when you make a \\ncovenant, and do not break your oaths after \\nratifying them. You have made Allah your \\nguarantor, and Allah knows what you do.\\n92. And do not be like her who unravels her \\nyarn, breaking it into pieces, after she has \\nspun it strongly. Nor use your oaths as means \\nof deception among you, because one com\\ufffemunity is more prosperous than another. Al\\ufffelah is testing you thereby. On the Day of Res\\ufffeurrection, He will make clear to you every\\ufffething you had disputed about. \\n93. Had Allah willed, He would have made you \\none congregation, but He leaves astray whom \\nHe wills, and He guides whom He wills. And \\nyou will surely be questioned about what you \\nused to do.\\n94. And do not use your oaths to deceive one \\nanother, so that a foot may not slip after being \\nfirm, and you taste misery because you hin\\ufffedered from Allah’s path, and incur a terrible \\ntorment.\\n95. And do not exchange Allah’s covenant for \\na small price. What is with Allah is better for \\nyou, if you only knew.\\n96. What you have runs out, but what is with \\nAllah remains. We will reward those who are \\npatient according to the best of their deeds.\\n97. Whoever works righteousness, whether \\nmale or female, while being a believer, We \\nwill grant him a good life—and We will re\\ufffeward them according to the best of what they \\nused to do.\\n98. When you read the Quran, seek refuge \\nwith Allah from Satan the outcast.\\n99. He has no authority over those who believe \\nand trust in their Lord.\\n100. His authority is only over those who fol\\ufffelow him, and those who associate others with \\nHim.\\n101. When We substitute a verse in place of an\\ufffeother verse—and Allah knows best what He \\n100\\n16. THE BEE (an-Nahl)\\nreveals—they say, “You are an impostor.” But \\nmost of them do not know.\\n102. Say, “The Holy Spirit has brought it down \\nfrom your Lord, truthfully, in order to stabi\\ufffelize those who believe, and as guidance and \\ngood news for those who submit.”\\n103. We are well aware that they say, “It is a hu\\ufffeman being who is teaching him.” But the \\ntongue of him they allude to is foreign, while \\nthis is a clear Arabic tongue.\\n104. Those who do not believe in Allah’s reve\\ufffelations—Allah will not guide them, and for \\nthem is a painful punishment.\\n105. It is those who do not believe in Allah’s \\nrevelations who fabricate falsehood. These \\nare the liars.\\n106. Whoever renounces faith in Allah after \\nhaving believed—except for someone who is \\ncompelled, while his heart rests securely in \\nfaith—but whoever willingly opens up his \\nheart to disbelief—upon them falls wrath \\nfrom Allah, and for them is a tremendous \\ntorment.\\n107. That is because they have preferred the \\nworldly life to the Hereafter, and because Al\\ufffelah does not guide the people who refuse.\\n108. It is they whom Allah has sealed their \\nhearts, and their hearing, and their sight. It is \\nthey who are the heedless.\\n109. There is no doubt that in the Hereafter \\nthey will be the losers.\\n110. But then your Lord—for those who emi\\ufffegrated after being persecuted, then struggled \\nand persevered—your Lord thereafter is For\\ufffegiving and Merciful.\\n111. On the Day when every soul will come \\npleading for itself, and every soul will be paid \\nin full for what it has done, and they will not \\nbe wronged.\\n112. And Allah cites the example of a town that \\nwas secure and peaceful, with its livelihood \\ncoming to it abundantly from every direc\\ufffetion. But then it turned unappreciative of Al\\ufffelah’s blessings, so Allah made it taste the robe \\nof hunger and fear, because of what they used \\nto craft.\\n113. A messenger from among them had come \\nto them, but they denounced him, so the \\npunishment seized them in the midst of their \\nwrongdoing.\\n114. Eat of the lawful and good things Allah has \\nprovided for you, and be thankful for Allah’s \\nblessings, if it is Him that you serve.\\n115. He has forbidden you carrion, and blood, \\nand the flesh of swine, and anything conse\\ufffecrated to other than Allah. But if anyone is \\ncompelled by necessity, without being delib\\ufffeerate or malicious, then Allah is Forgiving \\nand Merciful.\\n116. And do not say of falsehood asserted by \\nyour tongues, “This is lawful, and this is un\\ufffelawful,” in order to invent lies and attribute \\nthem to Allah. Those who invent lies and at\\ufffetribute them to Allah will not succeed.\\n117. A brief enjoyment—then they will have a \\npainful punishment.\\n118. For those who are Jews, We have prohib\\ufffeited what We related to you before. We did \\nnot wrong them, but they used to wrong their \\nown selves.\\n119. But towards those who do wrongs in igno\\uffferance, and then repent afterwards and re\\ufffeform, your Lord thereafter is Forgiving and \\nMerciful.\\n120. Abraham was an exemplary leader, de\\ufffevoted to Allah, a monotheist, and was not of \\nthe polytheists.\\n121. Thankful for His blessings. He chose him, \\nand guided him to a straight path.\\n122. And We gave him goodness in this world, \\nand in the Hereafter he will be among the \\nrighteous.\\n123. Then We inspired you: “Follow the reli\\ufffegion of Abraham, the Monotheist. He was \\nnot an idol-worshiper.”\\n124. The Sabbath was decreed only for those \\nwho differed about it. Your Lord will judge \\nbetween them on the Day of Resurrection re\\ufffegarding their differences.\\n101\\n17. THE NIGHT JOURNEY (al-Isra’)\\n125. Invite to the way of your Lord with wis\\ufffedom and good advice, and debate with them \\nin the most dignified manner. Your Lord is \\naware of those who stray from His path, and \\nHe is aware of those who are guided.\\n126. If you were to retaliate, retaliate to the \\nsame degree as the injury done to you. But if \\nyou resort to patience—it is better for the pa\\ufffetient.\\n127. So be patient. Your patience is solely from \\nAllah. And do not grieve over them, and do \\nnot be stressed by their schemes.\\n128. Allah is with those who are righteous and \\nthose who are virtuous.\\n17. THE NIGHT JOURNEY\\n(al-Isra’)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Glory to Him who journeyed His servant by \\nnight, from the Sacred Mosque, to the Far\\ufffethest Mosque, whose precincts We have \\nblessed, in order to show him of Our won\\ufffeders. He is the Listener, the Beholder.\\n2. And We gave Moses the Scripture, and \\nmade it a guide for the Children of Israel: \\nTake none for protector other than Me.\\n3. The descendants of those We carried with \\nNoah. He was an appreciative servant.\\n4. And We conveyed to the Children of Israel \\nin the Scripture: You will commit evil on \\nearth twice, and you will rise to a great height.\\n5. When the first of the two promises came \\ntrue, We sent against you servants of Ours, \\npossessing great might, and they ransacked \\nyour homes. It was a promise fulfilled.\\n6. Then We gave you back your turn against \\nthem, and supplied you with wealth and chil\\ufffedren, and made you more numerous.\\n7. If you work righteousness, you work right\\ufffeeousness for yourselves; and if you commit \\nevil, you do so against yourselves. Then, \\nwhen the second promise comes true, they \\nwill make your faces filled with sorrow, and \\nenter the Temple as they entered it the first \\ntime, and utterly destroy all that falls into \\ntheir power.\\n8. Perhaps your Lord will have mercy on you. \\nBut if you revert, We will revert. We have \\nmade Hell a prison for the disbelievers.\\n9. This Quran guides to what is most upright; \\nand it gives good news to the believers who \\ndo good deeds, that they will have a great re\\ufffeward.\\n10. And those who do not believe in the Here\\ufffeafter—We have prepared for them a painful \\npunishment.\\n11. The human being prays for evil as he prays \\nfor good. The human being is very hasty.\\n12. We have made the night and the day two \\nwonders. We erased the wonder of the night, \\nand made the wonder of the day revealing, \\nthat you may seek bounty from your Lord, \\nand know the number of years, and the cal\\ufffeculation. We have explained all things in de\\ufffetail.\\n13. For every person We have attached his fate \\nto his neck. And on the Day of Resurrection, \\nWe will bring out for him a book which he \\nwill find spread open.\\n14. “Read your book; today there will be none \\nbut yourself to call you to account.”\\n15. Whoever is guided—is guided for his own \\ngood. And whoever goes astray—goes astray \\nto his detriment. No burdened soul carries \\nthe burdens of another, nor do We ever pun\\ufffeish until We have sent a messenger.\\n16. When We decide to destroy a town, We \\ncommand its affluent ones, they transgress in \\nit, so the word becomes justified against it, \\nand We destroy it completely.\\n17. How many generations have We destroyed \\nafter Noah? Your Lord is sufficient as \\nKnower and Beholder of the sins of his serv\\ufffeants.\\n18. Whoever desires the fleeting life, We expe\\ufffedite for him what We decide to give him, to \\nwhomever We desire. Then We consign him \\n102\\n17. THE NIGHT JOURNEY (al-Isra’)\\nto Hell, where he will roast, condemned and \\ndefeated.\\n19. But whoever desires the Hereafter, and \\npursues it as it should be pursued, while he is \\na believer; these—their effort will be appreci\\ufffeated.\\n20. To all—these and those—We extend from \\nthe gifts of your Lord. The gifts of your Lord \\nare not restricted.\\n21. See how We have favored some of them \\nover others; yet the Hereafter is greater in \\nranks, and greater in favors.\\n22. Do not set up another god with Allah, lest \\nyou become condemned and damned.\\n23. Your Lord has commanded that you wor\\ufffeship none but Him, and that you be good to \\nyour parents. If either of them or both of \\nthem reach old age with you, do not say to \\nthem a word of disrespect, nor scold them, \\nbut say to them kind words.\\n24. And lower to them the wing of humility, \\nout of mercy, and say, “My Lord, have mercy \\non them, as they raised me when I was a \\nchild.”\\n25. Your Lord knows best what is in your \\nminds. If you are righteous—He is Forgiving \\nto the obedient.\\n26. And give the relative his rights, and the \\npoor, and the wayfarer, and do not squander \\nwastefully.\\n27. The extravagant are brethren of the devils, \\nand the devil is ever ungrateful to his Lord.\\n28. But if you turn away from them, seeking \\nmercy from your Lord which you hope for, \\nthen say to them words of comfort.\\n29. And do not keep your hand tied to your \\nneck, nor spread it out fully, lest you end up \\nliable and regretful.\\n30. Your Lord expands the provision for \\nwhomever He wills, and restricts it. He is \\nfully Informed, Observant of His servants.\\n31. And do not kill your children for fear of \\npoverty. We provide for them, and for you. \\nKilling them is a grave sin.\\n32. And do not come near adultery. It is im\\ufffemoral, and an evil way.\\n33. And do not kill the soul which Allah has \\nmade sacred, except in the course of justice. \\nIf someone is killed unjustly, We have given \\nhis next of kin certain authority. But he \\nshould not be excessive in killing, for he will \\nbe supported.\\n34. And do not go near the orphan’s property, \\nexcept with the best of intentions, until he has \\nreached his maturity. And honor your \\npledge, because the pledge involves responsi\\ufffebility.\\n35. And give full measure when you measure, \\nand weigh with accurate scales. That is fair, \\nand the best determination.\\n36. And do not occupy yourself with what you \\nhave no knowledge of. The hearing, and the \\nsight, and the brains—all these will be ques\\ufffetioned.\\n37. And do not walk proudly on earth. You can \\nneither pierce the earth, nor can you match \\nthe mountains in height.\\n38. The evil of all these is disliked by your \\nLord.\\n39. That is some of the wisdom your Lord has \\nrevealed to you. Do not set up with Allah an\\ufffeother god, or else you will be thrown in Hell, \\nrebuked and banished.\\n40. Has your Lord favored you with sons, \\nwhile choosing for Himself daughters from \\namong the angels? You are indeed saying a \\nterrible thing.\\n41. We have explained in this Quran in various \\nways, that they may remember, but it only \\nadds to their rebellion.\\n42. Say, “If there were other gods with Him, as \\nthey say, they would have sought a way to the \\nLord of the Throne.”\\n43. Be He glorified. He is exalted, far above \\nwhat they say.\\n44. Praising Him are the seven heavens, and \\nthe earth, and everyone in them. There is not \\na thing that does not glorify Him with praise, \\n103\\n17. THE NIGHT JOURNEY (al-Isra’)\\nbut you do not understand their praises. He \\nis indeed Forbearing and Forgiving.\\n45. When you read the Quran, We place be\\ufffetween you and those who do not believe in \\nthe Hereafter an invisible barrier.\\n46. And We drape veils over their hearts, pre\\ufffeventing them from understanding it, and \\nheaviness in their ears. And when you men\\ufffetion your Lord alone in the Quran, they turn \\ntheir backs in aversion.\\n47. We know well what they listen to, when \\nthey listen to you, as they conspire, when the \\nwrongdoers say, “You only follow a man be\\ufffewitched.”\\n48. Note what they compared you to. They are \\nlost, and unable to find a way.\\n49. And they say, “When we have become \\nbones and fragments, shall we really be resur\\uffferected as a new creation?”\\n50. Say, “Even if you become rocks or iron.\\n51. Or some substance, which, in your minds, \\nis even harder.” Then they will say, “Who will \\nrestore us?” Say, “The One who originated \\nyou the first time.” Then they will nod their \\nheads at you, and say, “When will it be?” Say, \\n“Perhaps it will be soon.”\\n52. On the Day when He calls you, you will re\\ufffespond with His praise, and you will realize \\nthat you stayed only a little.\\n53. Tell My servants to say what is best. Satan \\nsows discord among them. Satan is to man an \\nopen enemy. \\n54. Your Lord knows you best. If He wills, He \\nwill have mercy on you; and if He wills, He \\nwill punish you. We did not send you as their \\nadvocate.\\n55. Your Lord knows well everyone in the \\nheavens and the earth. We have given some \\nprophets advantage over others; and to David \\nWe gave the Psalms.\\n56. Say, “Call upon those you claim besides \\nHim. They have no power to relieve your ad\\ufffeversity, nor can they change it.”\\n57. Those they call upon are themselves seek\\ufffeing means of access to their Lord, vying to be \\nnearer, and hoping for His mercy, and fear\\ufffeing His punishment. The punishment of your \\nLord is to be dreaded.\\n58. There is no city but We will destroy before \\nthe Day of Resurrection, or punish it with a \\nsevere punishment. This is inscribed in the \\nBook.\\n59. Nothing prevents Us from sending mirac\\ufffeulous signs, except that the ancients called \\nthem lies. We gave Thamood the she-camel, \\na visible sign, but they mistreated her. We do \\nnot send the signs except to instill reverence.\\n60. We said to you that your Lord encom\\ufffepasses humanity. We did not make the vision \\nWe showed you, except as a test for the peo\\ufffeple, and the tree cursed in the Quran. We \\nfrighten them, but that only increases their \\ndefiance.\\n61. When We said to the angels, “Bow down \\nbefore Adam,” they bowed down, except for \\nSatan. He said, “Shall I bow down before \\nsomeone You created from mud?”\\n62. He said, “Do You see this one whom You \\nhave honored more than me? If You reprieve \\nme until the Day of Resurrection, I will bring \\nhis descendants under my sway, except for a \\nfew.”\\n63. He said, “Begone! Whoever of them fol\\ufffelows you—Hell is your reward, an ample re\\ufffeward.”\\n64. “And entice whomever of them you can \\nwith your voice, and rally against them your \\ncavalry and your infantry, and share with \\nthem in wealth and children, and make \\npromises to them.” But Satan promises them \\nnothing but delusion.\\n65. “As for My devotees, you have no authority \\nover them.” Your Lord is an adequate Guard\\ufffeian.\\n66. Your Lord is He who propels for you the \\nships at sea, that you may seek of His bounty. \\nHe is towards you Most Merciful.\\n104\\n17. THE NIGHT JOURNEY (al-Isra’)\\n67. When harm afflicts you at sea, those you \\npray to vanish, except for Him. But when He \\nsaves you to land, you turn away. The human \\nbeing is ever thankless.\\n68. Are you confident that He will not cause a \\ntrack of land to cave in beneath you, or un\\ufffeleash a tornado against you, and then you \\nfind no protector?\\n69. Or are you confident that He will not re\\ufffeturn you to it once again, and unleash a hur\\ufffericane against you, and drown you for your \\ningratitude? Then you will find no helper \\nagainst Us.\\n70. We have honored the Children of Adam, \\nand carried them on land and sea, and pro\\ufffevided them with good things, and greatly fa\\ufffevored them over many of those We created.\\n71. On the Day when We call every people with \\ntheir leader. Whoever is given his record in \\nhis right hand—these will read their record, \\nand they will not be wronged one bit.\\n72. But whoever is blind in this, he will be \\nblind in the Hereafter, and further astray \\nfrom the way.\\n73. They almost lured you away from what We \\nhave revealed to you, so that you would in\\ufffevent something else in Our name. In that \\ncase, they would have taken you for a friend.\\n74. Had We not given you stability, you might \\nhave inclined towards them a little.\\n75. Then We would have made you taste dou\\ufffeble in life, and double at death; then you \\nwould have found for yourself no helper \\nagainst Us.\\n76. They almost provoked you, to expel you \\nfrom the land. In that case, they would not \\nhave lasted after you, except briefly.\\n77. The tradition of the messengers We sent \\nbefore you—you will find no change in Our \\nrules.\\n78. Perform the prayer at the decline of the \\nsun, until the darkness of the night; and the \\nQuran at dawn. The Quran at dawn is wit\\ufffenessed.\\n79. And keep vigil with it during parts of the \\nnight, as an extra prayer. Perhaps your Lord \\nwill raise you to a laudable position.\\n80. And say, “My Lord, lead me in through an \\nentry of truth, and lead me out through an \\nexit of truth, and grant me from You a sup\\ufffeporting power.”\\n81. And say, “The truth has come, and false\\ufffehood has withered away; for falsehood is \\nbound to wither away.”\\n82. We send down in the Quran healing and \\nmercy for the believers, but it increases the \\nwrongdoers only in loss.\\n83. When We bless the human being, he turns \\naway and distances himself. But when adver\\ufffesity touches him, he is in despair.\\n84. Say, “Each does according to his disposi\\ufffetion. Your Lord knows best who is better \\nguided in the way.”\\n85. And they ask you about the Spirit. Say, \\n“The Spirit belongs to the domain of my \\nLord; and you were given only little \\nknowledge.”\\n86. If We willed, We could take away what We \\nrevealed to you. Then you will find for your\\ufffeself no protecting guardian against Us.\\n87. Except through a mercy from your Lord. \\nHis favors upon you have been great.\\n88. Say, “If mankind and jinn came together to \\nproduce the like of this Quran, they could \\nnever produce the like of it, even if they \\nbacked up one another.”\\n89. We have displayed for mankind in this \\nQuran every kind of similitude, but most \\npeople insist on denying the truth.\\n90. And they said, “We will not believe in you \\nunless you make a spring burst from the \\nground for us.\\n91. Or you have a garden of palms and vines; \\nthen cause rivers to gush pouring through \\nthem.\\n92. Or make the sky fall on us in pieces, as you \\nclaim, or bring Allah and the angels before us.\\n105\\n18. THE CAVE (al-Kahf)\\n93. Or you possess a house of gold. Or you as\\ufffecend into the sky. Even then, we will not be\\ufffelieve in your ascension, unless you bring \\ndown for us a book that we can read.” Say, \\n“Glory be to my Lord. Am I anything but a \\nhuman messenger?”\\n94. Nothing prevented the people from believ\\ufffeing, when guidance has come to them, except \\nthat they said, “Did Allah send a human mes\\ufffesenger?”\\n95. Say, “If there were angels on earth, walking \\naround in peace, We would have sent down \\nto them from heaven an angel messenger.”\\n96. Say, “Allah is enough witness between you \\nand me. He is fully aware of His servants, and \\nHe sees them well.”\\n97. Whomever Allah guides is the guided one. \\nAnd whomever He leaves astray—for them \\nyou will find no protectors apart from Him. \\nAnd We will gather them on the Day of Res\\ufffeurrection, on their faces, blind, dumb, and \\ndeaf. Their abode is Hell; whenever it abates, \\nWe intensify the blaze for them.\\n98. This is their repayment for having blas\\ufffephemed against Our revelations, and having \\nsaid, “Shall we, when we have become bones \\nand fragments, be resurrected as a new crea\\ufffetion?”\\n99. Do they not consider that Allah, Who cre\\ufffeated the heavens and the earth, is Able to cre\\ufffeate the likes of them? He has assigned for \\nthem a term, in which there is no doubt. But \\nthe wrongdoers persist in denying the truth.\\n100. Say, “If you possessed the treasuries of my \\nLord’s mercy, you would have withheld them \\nfor fear of spending.” The human being has \\nalways been stingy.\\n101. We gave Moses nine clear signs—ask the \\nChildren of Israel. When he went to them, \\nPharaoh said to him, “I think that you, Mo\\ufffeses, are bewitched.”\\n102. He said, “You know that none sent these \\ndown except the Lord of the heavens and the \\nearth—eye openers; and I think that you, \\nPharaoh, are doomed.”\\n103. He resolved to scare them off the land, but \\nWe drowned him, and those with him, alto\\ufffegether.\\n104. After him, We said to the Children of Is\\uffferael, “Inhabit the land, and when the promise \\nof the Hereafter arrives, We will bring you all \\ntogether.”\\n105. With the truth We sent it down, and with \\nthe truth it descended. We sent you only as a \\nbearer of good news and a warner.\\n106. A Quran which We unfolded gradually, \\nthat you may recite to the people over time. \\nAnd We revealed it in stages.\\n107. Say, “Believe in it, or do not believe.” \\nThose who were given knowledge before it, \\nwhen it is recited to them, they fall to their \\nchins, prostrating.\\n108. And they say, “Glory to our Lord. The \\npromise of our Lord is fulfilled.”\\n109. And they fall to their chins, weeping, and \\nit adds to their humility.\\n110. Say, “Call Him Allah, or call Him the Most \\nMerciful. Whichever name you use, to Him \\nbelong the Best Names.” And be neither loud \\nin your prayer, nor silent in it, but follow a \\ncourse in between.\\n111. And say, “Praise be to Allah, who has not \\nbegotten a son, nor has He a partner in sov\\ufffeereignty, nor has He an ally out of weakness, \\nand glorify Him constantly.”\\n18. THE CAVE\\n(al-Kahf)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Praise be to Allah, who revealed the Book to \\nHis servant, and allowed in it no distortion.\\n2. Valuable—to warn of severe punishment \\nfrom Himself; and to deliver good news to the \\nbelievers who do righteous deeds, that they \\nwill have an excellent reward.\\n3. In which they will abide forever. \\n106\\n18. THE CAVE (al-Kahf)\\n4. And to warn those who say, “Allah has be\\ufffegotten a son.”\\n5. They have no knowledge of this, nor did \\ntheir forefathers. Grave is the word that \\ncomes out of their mouths. They say nothing \\nbut a lie. \\n6. Perhaps you may destroy yourself with \\ngrief, chasing after them, if they do not be\\ufffelieve in this information.\\n7. We made what is upon the earth an orna\\ufffement for it, to test them as to which of them \\nis best in conduct.\\n8. And We will turn what is on it into barren \\nwaste.\\n9. Did you know that the People of the Cave \\nand the Inscription were of Our wondrous \\nsigns?\\n10. When the youths took shelter in the cave, \\nthey said, “Our Lord, give us mercy from \\nYourself, and bless our affair with guidance.”\\n11. Then We sealed their ears in the cave for a \\nnumber of years.\\n12. Then We awakened them to know which \\nof the two groups could better calculate the \\nlength of their stay.\\n13. We relate to you their story in truth. They \\nwere youths who believed in their Lord, and \\nWe increased them in guidance.\\n14. And We strengthened their hearts, when \\nthey stood up and said, “Our Lord is the Lord \\nof the heavens and the earth; we will not call \\non any god besides Him, for then we would \\nhave spoken an outrage.”\\n15. “These people, our people, have taken to \\nthemselves gods other than Him. Why do \\nthey not bring a clear proof concerning \\nthem? Who, then, does greater wrong than he \\nwho invents lies and attributes them to Al\\ufffelah?”\\n16. “Now that you have withdrawn from them, \\nand from what they worship besides Allah, \\ntake shelter in the cave. And your Lord will \\nunfold His mercy for you, and will set your \\naffair towards ease.”\\n17. You would have seen the sun, when it rose, \\nveering away from their cave towards the \\nright, and when it sets, moving away from \\nthem to the left, as they lay in the midst of the \\ncave. That was one of Allah’s wonders. He \\nwhom Allah guides is truly guided; but he \\nwhom He misguides, for him you will find no \\ndirecting friend.\\n18. You would think them awake, although \\nthey were asleep. And We turned them over \\nto the right, and to the left, with their dog \\nstretching its paws across the threshold. Had \\nyou looked at them, you would have turned \\naway from them in flight, and been filled with \\nfear of them.\\n19. Even so, We awakened them, so that they \\nmay ask one another. A speaker among them \\nsaid, “How long have you stayed?” They said, \\n“We have stayed a day, or part of a day.” They \\nsaid, “Your Lord knows best how long you \\nhave stayed.” “Send one of you to the city, \\nwith this money of yours, and let him see \\nwhich food is most suitable, and let him bring \\nyou some provision thereof. And let him be \\ngentle, and let no one become aware of you.”\\n20. “If they discover you, they will stone you, \\nor force you back into their religion; then you \\nwill never be saved.”\\n21. So it was, that We caused them to be dis\\ufffecovered, that they would know that the \\npromise of Allah is true, and that of the Hour \\nthere is no doubt. As they were disputing \\ntheir case among themselves, they said, \\n“Build over them a building.” Their Lord \\nknows best about them. Those who prevailed \\nover their case said, “We will set up over them \\na place of worship.”\\n22. They will say, “Three, and their fourth be\\ufffeing their dog.” And they will say, “Five, and \\ntheir sixth being their dog,” guessing at the \\nunknown. And they will say, “Seven, and \\ntheir eighth being their dog.” Say, “My Lord \\nknows best their number.” None knows them \\nexcept a few. So do not argue concerning \\nthem except with an obvious argument, and \\ndo not consult any of them about them.\\n107\\n18. THE CAVE (al-Kahf)\\n23. And never say about anything, “I will do \\nthat tomorrow.”\\n24. Without saying, “If Allah wills.” And re\\ufffemember your Lord if you forget, and say, \\n“Perhaps my Lord will guide me to nearer \\nthan this in integrity.”\\n25. And they stayed in their cave for three hun\\ufffedred years, adding nine.\\n26. Say, “Allah knows best how long they \\nstayed.” His is the mystery of the heavens and \\nthe earth. By Him you see and hear. They \\nhave no guardian apart from Him, and He \\nshares His Sovereignty with no one.\\n27. And recite what was revealed to you from \\nthe Book of your Lord. There is no changing \\nHis words, and you will find no refuge except \\nin Him.\\n28. And content yourself with those who pray \\nto their Lord morning and evening, desiring \\nHis Presence. And do not turn your eyes \\naway from them, desiring the glitter of this \\nworld. And do not obey him whose heart We \\nhave made heedless of Our remembrance—\\nso he follows his own desires—and his prior\\ufffeities are confused.\\n29. And say, “The truth is from your Lord. \\nWhoever wills—let him believe. And who\\ufffeever wills—let him disbelieve”. We have pre\\ufffepared for the unjust a Fire, whose curtains \\nwill hem them in. And when they cry for re\\ufffelief, they will be relieved with water like mol\\ufffeten brass, which scalds the faces. What a mis\\ufffeerable drink, and what a terrible place.\\n30. As for those who believe and lead a right\\ufffeeous life—We will not waste the reward of \\nthose who work righteousness.\\n31. These will have the Gardens of Eden, be\\ufffeneath which rivers flow. Reclining on com\\ufffefortable furnishings, they will be adorned \\nwith bracelets of gold, and will wear green \\ngarments of silk and brocade. What a won\\ufffederful reward, and what an excellent resting\\ufffeplace.\\n32. And cite for them the parable of two men. \\nTo one of them We gave two gardens of vine, \\nand We surrounded them with palm-trees, \\nand We placed between them crops.\\n33. Both gardens produced their harvest in \\nfull, and suffered no loss. And We made a \\nriver flow through them.\\n34. And thus he had abundant fruits. He said \\nto his friend, as he conversed with him, “I am \\nwealthier than you, and greater in man\\ufffepower.”\\n35. And he entered his garden, wronging him\\ufffeself. He said, “I do not think this will ever per\\ufffeish.”\\n36. “And I do not think the Hour is coming. \\nAnd even if I am returned to my Lord, I will \\nfind something better than this in return.”\\n37. His friend said to him, as he conversed \\nwith him, “Are you being ungrateful to Him \\nwho created you from dust, then from a \\nsperm-drop, then evolved you into a man?\\n38. But as for me, He is Allah, my Lord, and I \\nnever associate with my Lord anyone.\\n39. When you entered your garden, why did \\nyou not say, “As Allah wills; there is no power \\nexcept through Allah”? Although you see me \\ninferior to you in wealth and children.\\n40. Perhaps my Lord will give me something \\nbetter than your garden, and release upon it \\nthunderbolts from the sky, so it becomes bar\\uffferen waste.\\n41. Or its water will sink into the ground, and \\nyou will be unable to draw it.”\\n42. And ruin closed in on his crops, and so he \\nbegan wringing his hands over what he had \\ninvested in it, as it lays fallen upon its trellises. \\nAnd he was saying, “I wish I never associated \\nanyone with my Lord.”\\n43. He had no faction to help him besides Al\\ufffelah, and he was helpless.\\n44. That is because authority belongs to Allah, \\nthe True. He is Best in rewarding, and Best in \\nrequiting.\\n45. And cite for them the parable of the pre\\ufffesent life: it is like water that We send down \\nfrom the sky; the plants of the earth absorb it; \\n108\\n18. THE CAVE (al-Kahf)\\nbut then it becomes debris, scattered by the \\nwind. Allah has absolute power over every\\ufffething.\\n46. Wealth and children are the adornments of \\nthe present life. But the things that last, the \\nvirtuous deeds, are better with your Lord for \\nreward, and better for hope.\\n47. On the Day when We set the mountains in \\nmotion; and you see the earth emerging; and \\nWe gather them together, and leave none of \\nthem behind.\\n48. They will be presented before your Lord in \\na row. “You have come to Us as We created \\nyou the first time. Although you claimed We \\nwould not set a meeting for you.”\\n49. And the book will be placed, and you will \\nsee the sinners fearful of its contents. And \\nthey will say, “Woe to us! What is with this \\nbook that leaves nothing, small or big, but it \\nhas enumerated it?” They will find everything \\nthey had done present. Your Lord does not \\nwrong anyone. \\n50. We said to the angels, “Bow down to \\nAdam.” So they bowed down, except for Sa\\ufffetan. He was of the jinn, and he defied the \\ncommand of his Lord. Will you take him and \\nhis offspring as lords instead of Me, when \\nthey are an enemy to you? Evil is the ex\\ufffechange for the wrongdoers.\\n51. I did not call them to witness the creation \\nof the heavens and the earth, nor their own \\ncreation; and I do not take the misleaders for \\nassistants.\\n52. On the Day when He will say, “Call on My \\npartners whom you have claimed.” They will \\ncall on them, but they will not answer them. \\nAnd We will place between them a barrier.\\n53. And the sinners will see the Fire, and will \\nrealize that they will tumble into it. They will \\nfind no deliverance from it.\\n54. We have elaborated in this Quran for the \\npeople every kind of example, but the human \\nbeing is a most argumentative being.\\n55. What prevented people from accepting \\nfaith, when guidance has come to them, and \\nfrom seeking their Lord’s forgiveness? Unless \\nthey are waiting for the precedent of the an\\ufffecients to befall them, or to have the punish\\ufffement come upon them face to face.\\n56. We send the messengers only as deliverers \\nof good news and warners. Those who disbe\\ufffelieve argue with false argument, in order to \\ndefeat the truth thereby. They take My \\nVerses, and the warnings, for a joke.\\n57. Who does greater wrong than he, who, \\nwhen reminded of his Lord’s revelations,\\nturns away from them, and forgets what his \\nhands have put forward? We have placed \\ncoverings over their hearts, lest they under\\ufffestand it, and heaviness in their ears. And if \\nyou call them to guidance, they will not be \\nguided, ever.\\n58. Your Lord is the Forgiver, Possessor of \\nMercy. Were He to call them to account for \\nwhat they have earned, He would have has\\ufffetened the punishment for them. But they \\nhave an appointment from which they will \\nfind no escape.\\n59. And these towns—We destroyed them \\nwhen they committed injustices, and We set \\nfor their destruction an appointed time.\\n60. Recall when Moses said to his servant, “I \\nwill not give up until I reach the junction of \\nthe two rivers, even if it takes me years.”\\n61. Then, when they reached the junction be\\ufffetween them, they forgot about their fish. It \\nfound its way into the river, slipping away.\\n62. When they went further, he said to his \\nservant, “Bring us our lunch; we were ex\\ufffeposed in our travel to much fatigue.”\\n63. He said, “Do you remember when we \\nrested by the rock? I forgot about the fish. It \\nwas only the devil who made me forget it. \\nAnd so it found its way to the river, amaz\\ufffeingly.”\\n64. He said, “This is what we were seeking.” \\nAnd so they turned back retracing their steps.\\n65. Then they came upon a servant of Ours, \\nwhom We had blessed with mercy from Us, \\n109\\n18. THE CAVE (al-Kahf)\\nand had taught him knowledge from Our \\nOwn.\\n66. Moses said to him, “May I follow you, so \\nthat you may teach me some of the guidance \\nyou were taught?”\\n67. He said, “You will not be able to endure \\nwith me.\\n68. And how will you endure what you have no \\nknowledge of?”\\n69. He said, “You will find me, Allah willing, \\npatient; and I will not disobey you in any or\\ufffeder of yours.”\\n70. He said, “If you follow me, do not ask me \\nabout anything, until I myself make mention \\nof it to you.”\\n71. So they set out. Until, when they had \\nboarded the boat, he holed it. He said, “Did \\nyou hole it, to drown its passengers? You \\nhave done something awful.”\\n72. He said, “Did I not tell you that you will not \\nbe able to endure with me?”\\n73. He said, “Do not rebuke me for forgetting, \\nand do not make my course difficult for me.”\\n74. Then they set out. Until, when they en\\ufffecountered a boy, he killed him. He said, “Did \\nyou kill a pure soul, who killed no one? You \\nhave done something terrible.”\\n75. He said,“Did I not tell you that you will not \\nbe able to endure with me?”\\n76. He said, “If I ask you about anything after \\nthis, then do not keep company with me. You \\nhave received excuses from me.”\\n77. So they set out. Until, when they reached \\nthe people of a town, they asked them for \\nfood, but they refused to offer them hospital\\ufffeity. There they found a wall about to collapse, \\nand he repaired it. He said, “If you wanted, \\nyou could have obtained a payment for it.”\\n78. He said, “This is the parting between you \\nand me. I will tell you the interpretation of \\nwhat you were unable to endure.\\n79. As for the boat, it belonged to paupers \\nworking at sea. I wanted to damage it because \\nthere was a king coming after them seizing \\nevery boat by force.\\n80. As for the boy, his parents were believers, \\nand we feared he would overwhelm them \\nwith oppression and disbelief.\\n81. So we wanted their Lord to replace him \\nwith someone better in purity, and closer to \\nmercy.\\n82. And as for the wall, it belonged to two or\\ufffephaned boys in the town. Beneath it was a \\ntreasure that belonged to them. Their father \\nwas a righteous man. Your Lord wanted them \\nto reach their maturity, and then extract their \\ntreasure—as a mercy from your Lord. I did \\nnot do it of my own accord. This is the inter\\ufffepretation of what you were unable to en\\ufffedure.”\\n83. And they ask you about Zul-Qarnain. Say, \\n“I will tell you something about him.”\\n84. We established him on earth, and gave him \\nall kinds of means.\\n85. He pursued a certain course.\\n86. Until, when he reached the setting of the \\nsun, he found it setting in a murky spring, \\nand found a people in its vicinity. We said, “O \\nZul-Qarnain, you may either inflict a penalty, \\nor else treat them kindly.”\\n87. He said, “As for him who does wrong, we \\nwill penalize him, then he will be returned to \\nhis Lord, and He will punish him with an un\\ufffeheard-of torment.\\n88. “But as for him who believes and acts right\\ufffeeously, he will have the finest reward, and We \\nwill speak to him of Our command with \\nease.”\\n89. Then he pursued a course.\\n90. Until, when he reached the rising of the \\nsun, he found it rising on a people for whom \\nWe had provided no shelter from it.\\n91. And so it was. We had full knowledge of \\nwhat he had.\\n92. Then he pursued a course.\\n93. Until, when he reached the point separat\\ufffeing the two barriers, he found beside them a \\n110\\n19. MARY (Maryam)\\npeople who could barely understand what is \\nsaid.\\n94. They said, “O Zul-Qarnain, the Gog and \\nMagog are spreading chaos in the land. Can \\nwe pay you, to build between us and them a \\nwall?”\\n95. He said, “What my Lord has empowered \\nme with is better. But assist me with strength, \\nand I will build between you and them a \\ndam.”\\n96. “Bring me blocks of iron.” So that, when he \\nhad leveled up between the two cliffs, he said, \\n“Blow.” And having turned it into a fire, he \\nsaid, “Bring me tar to pour over it.”\\n97. So they were unable to climb it, and they \\ncould not penetrate it.\\n98. He said, “This is a mercy from my Lord. \\nBut when the promise of my Lord comes true, \\nHe will turn it into rubble, and the promise \\nof my Lord is always true.”\\n99. On that Day, We will leave them surging \\nupon one another. And the Trumpet will be \\nblown, and We will gather them together.\\n100. On that Day, We will present the disbe\\ufffelievers to Hell, all displayed.\\n101. Those whose eyes were screened to My \\nmessage, and were unable to hear.\\n102. Do those who disbelieve think that they \\ncan take My servants for masters instead of \\nMe? We have prepared Hell for the hospital\\ufffeity of the faithless.\\n103. Say, “Shall We inform you of the greatest \\nlosers in their works?”\\n104. “Those whose efforts in this world are \\nmisguided, while they assume that they are \\ndoing well.”\\n105. It is they who rejected the communica\\ufffetions of their Lord, and the encounter with \\nHim. So their works are in vain. And on the \\nDay of Resurrection, We will consider them \\nof no weight.\\n106. That is their requital—Hell—on account \\nof their disbelief, and their taking My revela\\ufffetions and My messengers in mockery.\\n107. As for those who believe and do righteous \\ndeeds, they will have the Gardens of Paradise \\nfor hospitality.\\n108. Abiding therein forever, without desiring \\nany change therefrom.\\n109. Say, “If the ocean were ink for the words \\nof my Lord, the ocean would run out, before \\nthe words of my Lord run out,” even if We \\nwere to bring the like of it in addition to it.\\n110. Say, “I am only a human being like you, \\nbeing inspired that your god is One God. \\nWhoever hopes to meet his Lord, let him \\nwork righteousness, and never associate any\\ufffeone with the service of his Lord.”\\n19. MARY\\n(Maryam)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Kaf, Ha, Ya, Ayn, Saad.\\n2. A mention of the mercy of your Lord to\\ufffewards His servant Zechariah.\\n3. When he called on his Lord, a call in seclu\\ufffesion.\\n4. He said, “My Lord, my bones have become \\nfeeble, and my hair is aflame with gray, and \\nnever, Lord, have I been disappointed in my \\nprayer to you.\\n5. “And I fear for my dependents after me, and \\nmy wife is barren. So grant me, from Your\\ufffeself, an heir.\\n6. To inherit me, and inherit from the House \\nof Jacob, and make him, my Lord, pleasing.”\\n7. “O Zechariah, We give you good news of a \\nson, whose name is John, a name We have \\nnever given before.”\\n8. He said, “My Lord, how can I have a son, \\nwhen my wife is barren, and I have become \\ndecrepit with old age?”\\n9. He said, “It will be so, your Lord says, ‘it is \\neasy for me, and I created you before, when \\nyou were nothing.’”\\n111\\n19. MARY (Maryam)\\n10. He said, “My Lord, give me a sign.” He said, \\n“Your sign is that you will not speak to the \\npeople for three nights straight.”\\n11. And he came out to his people, from the \\nsanctuary, and signaled to them to praise \\nmorning and evening.\\n12. “O John, hold on to the Scripture firmly,” \\nand We gave him wisdom in his youth.\\n13. And tenderness from Us, and innocence. \\nHe was devout.\\n14. And kind to his parents; and he was not a \\ndisobedient tyrant.\\n15. And peace be upon him the day he was \\nborn, and the day he dies, and the Day he is \\nraised alive.\\n16. And mention in the Scripture Mary, when \\nshe withdrew from her people to an eastern \\nlocation.\\n17. She screened herself away from them, and \\nWe sent to her Our spirit, and He appeared \\nto her as an immaculate human.\\n18. She said, “I take refuge from you in the \\nMost Merciful, should you be righteous.”\\n19. He said, “I am only the messenger of your \\nLord, to give you the gift of a pure son.”\\n20. She said, “How can I have a son, when no \\nman has touched me, and I was never un\\ufffechaste?”\\n21. He said, “Thus said your Lord, `It is easy \\nfor Me, and We will make him a sign for hu\\ufffemanity, and a mercy from Us. It is a matter \\nalready decided.'“\\n22. So she carried him, and secluded herself \\nwith him in a remote place.\\n23. The labor-pains came upon her, by the \\ntrunk of a palm-tree. She said, “I wish I had \\ndied before this, and been completely forgot\\ufffeten.”\\n24. Whereupon he called her from beneath \\nher: “Do not worry; your Lord has placed a \\nstream beneath you.\\n25. And shake the trunk of the palm-tree to\\ufffewards you, and it will drop ripe dates by you.”\\n26. “So eat, and drink, and be consoled. And if \\nyou see any human, say, ‘I have vowed a fast \\nto the Most Gracious, so I will not speak to \\nany human today.'“\\n27.Then she came to her people, carrying him. \\nThey said, “O Mary, you have done some\\ufffething terrible.\\n28. O sister of Aaron, your father was not an \\nevil man, and your mother was not a whore.”\\n29. So she pointed to him. They said, “How \\ncan we speak to an infant in the crib?”\\n30. He said, “I am the servant of Allah. He has \\ngiven me the Scripture, and made me a \\nprophet.\\n31. And has made me blessed wherever I may \\nbe; and has enjoined on me prayer and char\\ufffeity, so long as I live.\\n32. And kind to my mother, and He did not \\nmake me a disobedient rebel.\\n33. So Peace is upon me the day I was born, \\nand the day I die, and the Day I get resur\\uffferected alive.”\\n34. That is Jesus son of Mary—the Word of \\ntruth about which they doubt.\\n35. It is not for Allah to have a child—glory be \\nto Him. To have anything done, He says to it, \\n“Be,” and it becomes.\\n36. “Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so wor\\ufffeship Him. That is a straight path.”\\n37. But the various factions differed among \\nthemselves. So woe to those who disbelieve \\nfrom the scene of a tremendous Day.\\n38. Listen to them and watch for them the Day \\nthey come to Us. But the wrongdoers today \\nare completely lost.\\n39. And warn them of the Day of Regret, when \\nthe matter will be concluded. Yet they are \\nheedless, and they do not believe.\\n40. It is We who will inherit the earth and eve\\uffferyone on it, and to Us they will be returned.\\n41. And mention in the Scripture Abraham. \\nHe was a man of truth, a prophet.\\n112\\n19. MARY (Maryam)\\n42. He said to his father, “O my father, why do \\nyou worship what can neither hear, nor see, \\nnor benefit you in any way?\\n43. O my father, there has come to me \\nknowledge that never came to you. So follow \\nme, and I will guide you along a straight way.\\n44. O my father, do not worship the devil. The \\ndevil is disobedient to the Most Gracious.\\n45. O my father, I fear that a punishment from \\nthe Most Gracious will afflict you, and you \\nbecome an ally of the devil.”\\n46. He said, “Are you renouncing my gods, O \\nAbraham? If you do not desist, I will stone \\nyou. So leave me alone for a while.”\\n47. He said, “Peace be upon you. I will ask my \\nLord to forgive you; He has been Kind to me.\\n48. And I will withdraw from you, and from \\nwhat you pray to instead of Allah. And I will \\npray to my Lord, and I hope I will not be dis\\ufffeappointed in my prayer to my Lord.”\\n49. When he withdrew from them, and from \\nwhat they worship besides Allah, We granted \\nhim Isaac and Jacob. And each We made a \\nprophet.\\n50. And We gave them freely of Our mercy, \\nand gave them a noble reputation of truth.\\n51. And mention in the Scripture Moses. He \\nwas dedicated. He was a messenger and a \\nprophet.\\n52. And We called him from the right side of \\nthe Mount, and brought him near in com\\ufffemunion.\\n53. And We granted him, out of Our mercy, \\nhis brother Aaron, a prophet.\\n54. And mention in the Scripture Ishmael. He \\nwas true to his promise, and was a messenger, \\na prophet.\\n55. And he used to enjoin on his people prayer \\nand charity, and he was pleasing to his Lord.\\n56. And mention in the Scripture Enoch. He \\nwas a man of truth, a prophet.\\n57. And We raised him to a high position.\\n58. These are some of the prophets Allah has \\nblessed, from the descendants of Adam, and \\nfrom those We carried with Noah, and from \\nthe descendants of Abraham and Israel, and \\nfrom those We guided and selected. When\\ufffeever the revelations of the Most Gracious are \\nrecited to them, they would fall down, pros\\ufffetrating and weeping.\\n59. But they were succeeded by generations \\nwho lost the prayers and followed their appe\\ufffetites. They will meet perdition.\\n60. Except for those who repent, and believe, \\nand act righteously. These will enter Paradise, \\nand will not be wronged in the least.\\n61. The Gardens of Eden, promised by the \\nMost Merciful to His servants in the Unseen. \\nHis promise will certainly come true.\\n62. They will hear no nonsense therein, but \\nonly peace. And they will have their provision \\ntherein, morning and evening.\\n63. Such is Paradise which We will give as in\\ufffeheritance to those of Our servants who are \\ndevout.\\n64. “We do not descend except by the com\\ufffemand of your Lord. His is what is before us, \\nand what is behind us, and what is between \\nthem. Your Lord is never forgetful.”\\n65. Lord of the heavens and the earth and what \\nis between them. So worship Him, and perse\\ufffevere in His service. Do you know of anyone \\nequal to Him?\\n66. And the human being says, “When I am \\ndead, will I be brought back alive?”\\n67. Does the human being not remember that \\nWe created him before, when he was noth\\ufffeing?\\n68. By your Lord, We will round them up, and \\nthe devils, then We will bring them around \\nHell, on their knees.\\n69. Then, out of every sect, We will snatch \\nthose most defiant to the Most Merciful.\\n70. We are fully aware of those most deserving \\nto scorch in it.\\n113\\n20. TA-HA (Ta-Ha)\\n71. There is not one of you but will go down to \\nit. This has been an unavoidable decree of \\nyour Lord.\\n72. Then We will rescue those who were de\\ufffevout, and leave the wrongdoers in it, on their \\nknees.\\n73. When Our clear revelations are recited to \\nthem, those who disbelieve say to those who \\nbelieve, “Which of the two parties is better in \\nposition, and superior in influence?”\\n74. How many a generation have We de\\ufffestroyed before them, who surpassed them in \\nriches and splendor?\\n75. Say, “Whoever is in error, the Most Merci\\ufffeful will lead him on.” Until, when they see \\nwhat they were promised—either the punish\\ufffement, or the Hour. Then they will know who \\nwas in worse position and weaker in forces.\\n76. Allah increases in guidance those who ac\\ufffecept guidance. And the things that endure—\\nthe righteous deeds—have the best reward \\nwith your Lord, and the best outcome.\\n77. Have you seen him who denied Our reve\\ufffelations, and said, “I will be given wealth and \\nchildren”?\\n78. Did he look into the future, or did he re\\ufffeceive a promise from the Most Merciful?\\n79. No indeed! We will write what he says, and \\nwill keep extending the agony for him.\\n80. Then We will inherit from him what he \\nspeaks of, and he will come to Us alone.\\n81. And they took, besides Allah, other gods, \\nto be for them a source of strength.\\n82. By no means! They will reject their worship \\nof them, and become opponents to them.\\n83. Have you not considered how We dispatch\\nthe devils against the disbelievers, exciting \\nthem with incitement?\\n84. So do not hurry against them. We are \\ncounting for them a countdown.\\n85. On the Day when We will gather the right\\ufffeeous to the Most Merciful, as guests.\\n86. And herd the sinners into hell, like animals \\nto water.\\n87. They will have no power of intercession, \\nexcept for someone who has an agreement \\nwith the Most Merciful.\\n88. And they say, “The Most Merciful has be\\ufffegotten a son.”\\n89. You have come up with something mon\\ufffestrous.\\n90. At which the heavens almost rupture, and \\nthe earth splits, and the mountains fall and \\ncrumble.\\n91. Because they attribute a son to the Most \\nMerciful.\\n92. It is not fitting for the Most Merciful to \\nhave a son.\\n93. There is none in the heavens and the earth \\nbut will come to the Most Merciful as a serv\\ufffeant.\\n94. He has enumerated them, and counted \\nthem one by one. \\n95. And each one of them will come to Him on \\nthe Day of Resurrection alone.\\n96. Those who believe and do righteous deeds, \\nthe Most Merciful will give them love.\\n97. We made it easy in your tongue, in order \\nto deliver good news to the righteous, and to \\nwarn with it a hostile people.\\n98. How many a generation have We de\\ufffestroyed before them? Can you feel a single \\none of them, or hear from them the slightest \\nwhisper?\\n20. TA-HA\\n(Ta-Ha)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Ta, Ha.\\n2. We did not reveal the Quran to you to make \\nyou suffer.\\n3. But only as a reminder for him who fears.\\n4. A revelation from He who created the earth \\nand the high heavens.\\n114\\n20. TA-HA (Ta-Ha)\\n5. The Most Merciful; on the Throne He set\\ufffetled.\\n6. To Him belongs everything in the heavens \\nand the earth, and everything between them, \\nand everything beneath the soil.\\n7. If you speak aloud—He knows the secret, \\nand the most hidden.\\n8. Allah, there is no god but He, His are the \\nMost Beautiful Names. \\n9. Has the story of Moses reached you?\\n10. When he saw a fire, he said to his family, \\n“Stay; I have noticed a fire; Perhaps I can \\nbring you a torch therefrom, or find some \\nguidance by the fire.”\\n11. Then, when he reached it, he was called, “O \\nMoses.\\n12. I—I am your Lord. Take off your shoes. \\nYou are in the sacred valley of Tuwa.\\n13. I have chosen you, so listen to what is re\\ufffevealed.\\n14. I—I am Allah. There is no God but I. So \\nserve Me, and practice the prayer for My re\\ufffemembrance.\\n15. The Hour is coming—but I keep it almost \\nhidden—so that each soul will be paid for \\nwhat it endeavors.\\n16. And do not let him who denies it and fol\\ufffelows his desire turn you away from it, lest you \\nfall.\\n17. And what is that in your right-hand, O Mo\\ufffeses?”\\n18. He said, “This is my staff. I lean on it, and \\nherd my sheep with it, and I have other uses \\nfor it.”\\n19. He said, “Throw it, O Moses.”\\n20. So he threw it—thereupon it became a \\nmoving serpent.\\n21. He said, “Take hold of it, and do not fear. \\nWe will restore it to its original condition.\\n22. And press your hand to your side; it will \\ncome out white, without a blemish—another \\nsign.\\n23. That We may show you some of Our great\\ufffeest signs.\\n24. Go to Pharaoh; He has transgressed.”\\n25. He said, “My Lord, put my heart at peace \\nfor me.\\n26. And ease my task for me.\\n27. And untie the knot from my tongue.\\n28. So they can understand my speech.\\n29. And appoint an assistant for me, from my \\nfamily. \\n30. Aaron, my brother.\\n31. Strengthen me with him.\\n32. And have him share in my mission.\\n33. That we may glorify You much.\\n34. And remember You much.\\n35. You are always watching over us.”\\n36. He said, “You are granted your request, O \\nMoses.\\n37. We had favored you another time.\\n38. When We inspired your mother with the \\ninspiration.\\n39. `Put him in the chest; then cast him into \\nthe river. The river will wash him to shore, \\nwhere an enemy of Mine and an enemy of his \\nwill pick him up. And I have bestowed upon \\nyou love from Me, so that you may be reared \\nbefore My eye.\\n40. When your sister walked along, and said, \\n‘Shall I tell you about someone who will take \\ncare of him?' So We returned you to your \\nmother, that she may be comforted, and not \\nsorrow. And you killed a person, but We \\nsaved you from stress; and We tested you \\nthoroughly. And you stayed years among the \\npeople of Median. Then you came back, as \\nordained, O Moses.\\n41. And I made you for Myself.\\n42. Go, you and your brother, with My signs, \\nand do not neglect My remembrance.\\n43. Go to Pharaoh. He has tyrannized.\\n115\\n20. TA-HA (Ta-Ha)\\n44. But speak to him nicely. Perhaps he will re\\ufffemember, or have some fear.”\\n45. They said, “Lord, we fear he may persecute \\nus, or become violent.”\\n46. He said, “Do not fear, I am with you, I hear \\nand I see.\\n47. Approach him and say, `We are the mes\\ufffesengers of your Lord; so let the Children of \\nIsrael go with us, and do not torment them. \\nWe bring you a sign from your Lord, and \\npeace be upon him who follows guidance.\\n48. It was revealed to us that the punishment \\nfalls upon him who disbelieves and turns \\naway.'“\\n49. He said, “Who is your Lord, O Moses.”\\n50. He said, “Our Lord is He who gave every\\ufffething its existence, then guided it.”\\n51. He said, “What about the first genera\\ufffetions?”\\n52. He said, “Knowledge thereof is with my \\nLord, in a Book. My Lord never errs, nor does \\nHe forget.”\\n53. He who made the earth a habitat for you; \\nand traced in it routes for you; and sent down \\nwater from the sky, with which We produce \\npairs of diverse plants.\\n54. Eat and pasture your livestock. In that are \\nsigns for those with understanding.\\n55. From it We created you, and into it We will \\nreturn you, and from it We will bring you out \\nanother time.\\n56. We showed him Our signs, all of them, but \\nhe denied and refused.\\n57. He said, “Did you come to us to drive us \\nout of our land with your magic, O Moses?\\n58. We will produce for you magic like it; so \\nmake an appointment between us and you, \\nwhich we will not miss—neither us, nor \\nyou—in a central place.”\\n59. He said, “Your appointment is the day of \\nthe festival, so let the people be gathered to\\ufffegether at mid-morning.”\\n60. Pharaoh turned away, put together his \\nplan, and then came back.\\n61. Moses said to them, “Woe to you. Do not \\nfabricate lies against Allah, or He will destroy \\nyou with a punishment. He who invents lies \\nwill fail.”\\n62. They disagreed among themselves over \\ntheir affair, and conferred secretly.\\n63. They said, “These two are magicians who \\nwant to drive you out of your land with their \\nmagic, and to abolish your exemplary way of \\nlife.\\n64. So settle your plan, and come as one front. \\nToday, whoever gains the upper hand will \\nsucceed.”\\n65. They said, “O Moses, either you throw, or \\nwe will be the first to throw.”\\n66. He said, “You throw.” And suddenly, their \\nropes and sticks appeared to him, because of \\ntheir magic, to be crawling swiftly.\\n67. So Moses felt apprehensive within himself.\\n68. We said, “Do not be afraid, you are the up\\ufffepermost.\\n69. Now throw down what is in your right \\nhand—it will swallow what they have crafted. \\nWhat they have crafted is only a magician’s \\ntrickery. But the magician will not succeed, \\nno matter what he does.”\\n70. And the magicians fell down prostrate. \\nThey said, “We have believed in the Lord of \\nAaron and Moses.”\\n71. He said, “Did you believe in him before I \\nhave given you permission? He must be your \\nchief, who has taught you magic. I will cut off \\nyour hands and your feet on alternate sides, \\nand I will crucify you on the trunks of the \\npalm-trees. Then you will know which of us \\nis more severe in punishment, and more last\\ufffeing.”\\n72. They said, “We will not prefer you to the \\nproofs that have come to us, and Him who \\ncreated us. So issue whatever judgment you \\nwish to issue. You can only rule in this lowly \\nlife.\\n116\\n20. TA-HA (Ta-Ha)\\n73. We have believed in our Lord, so that He \\nmay forgive us our sins, and the magic you \\nhave compelled us to practice. Allah is Better, \\nand more Lasting.”\\n74. Whoever comes to his Lord guilty, for him \\nis Hell, where he neither dies nor lives.\\n75. But whoever comes to Him a believer, hav\\ufffeing worked righteousness—these will have \\nthe highest ranks.\\n76. The Gardens of Perpetuity, beneath which \\nrivers flow, dwelling therein forever. That is \\nthe reward for him who purifies himself.\\n77. And We inspired Moses: “Travel by night \\nwith My servants, and strike for them a dry \\npath across the sea, not fearing being over\\ufffetaken, nor worrying.”\\n78. Pharaoh pursued them with his troops, but \\nthe sea overwhelmed them, and completely \\nengulfed them.\\n79. Pharaoh misled his people, and did not \\nguide them.\\n80. O Children of Israel! We have delivered \\nyou from your enemy, and promised you by \\nthe right side of the Mount, and sent down to \\nyou manna and quails.\\n81. Eat of the good things We have provided \\nfor you, but do not be excessive therein, lest \\nMy wrath descends upon you. He upon \\nwhom My wrath descends has fallen.\\n82. And I am Forgiving towards him who re\\ufffepents, believes, acts righteously, and then re\\ufffemains guided.\\n83. “And what made you rush ahead of your \\npeople, O Moses?”\\n84. He said, “They are following in my foot\\ufffesteps; and I hurried on to You, my Lord, that \\nyou may be pleased.”\\n85. He said, “We have tested your people in \\nyour absence, and the Samarian misled \\nthem.”\\n86. So Moses returned to his people, angry and \\ndisappointed. He said, “O my people, did \\nyour Lord not promise you a good promise? \\nWas the time too long for you? Or did you \\nwant wrath from your Lord to descend upon \\nyou, so you broke your promise to me?”\\n87. They said, “We did not break our promise \\nto you by our choice, but we were made to \\ncarry loads of the people’s ornaments, and we \\ncast them in. That was what the Samarian \\nsuggested.”\\n88. So he produced for them a calf—a mere \\nbody which lowed. And they said, “This is \\nyour god, and the god of Moses, but he has \\nforgotten.”\\n89. Did they not see that it cannot return a \\nword to them, and has no power to harm \\nthem or benefit them?\\n90.Aaron had said to them before, “O my peo\\ufffeple, you are being tested by this. And your \\nLord is the Merciful, so follow me, and obey \\nmy command.”\\n91. They said, “We will not give up our devo\\ufffetion to it, until Moses returns to us.”\\n92. He said, “O Aaron, what prevented you, \\nwhen you saw them going astray.\\n93. From following me? Did you disobey my \\ncommand?”\\n94. He said, “Son of my mother, do not seize \\nme by my beard or my head. I feared you \\nwould say, `You have caused division among \\nthe Children of Israel, and did not regard my \\nword.'“\\n95. He said, “What do you have to say, O Sa\\ufffemarian?”\\n96. He said, “I saw what they did not see, so I \\ngrasped a handful from the Messenger’s \\ntraces, and I flung it away. Thus my soul \\nprompted me.”\\n97. He said, “Begone! Your lot in this life is to \\nsay, ‘No contact.’ And you have an appoint\\ufffement that you will not miss. Now look at your \\ngod that you remained devoted to—we will \\nburn it up, and then blow it away into the sea, \\nas powder.”\\n98. Surely your god is Allah, the One besides \\nwhom there is no other god. He compre\\ufffehends everything in knowledge.\\n117\\n20. TA-HA (Ta-Ha)\\n99. Thus We narrate to you reports of times \\ngone by; and We have given you a message \\nfrom Our Presence. \\n100. Whoever turns away from it will carry on \\nthe Day of Resurrection a burden.\\n101. Abiding therein forever. And wretched is \\ntheir burden on the Day of Resurrection.\\n102. On the Day when the Trumpet is blown—\\nWe will gather the sinners on that Day, blue.\\n103. Murmuring among themselves: “You have \\nlingered only for ten.”\\n104. We are fully aware of what they say, when \\nthe most exemplary of them in conduct will \\nsay, “You have lingered only a day.”\\n105. And they ask you about the mountains. \\nSay, “My Lord will crumble them utterly.”\\n106. And leave them desolate waste.\\n107. You will see in them neither crookedness, \\nnor deviation.”\\n108. On that Day, they will follow the caller, \\nwithout any deviation. Voices will be hushed \\nbefore the Merciful, and you will hear noth\\ufffeing but murmur. \\n109. On that Day, intercession will not avail, \\nexcept for him permitted by the Merciful, and \\nwhose words He has approved.\\n110. He knows what is before them and what is \\nbehind them, and they cannot comprehend \\nHim in their knowledge.\\n111. Faces will be humbled before the Living, \\nthe Eternal. Whoever carries injustice will \\ndespair.\\n112. But whoever has done righteous deeds, \\nwhile being a believer—will fear neither in\\ufffejustice, nor grievance.\\n113. Thus We have revealed it an Arabic \\nQuran, and We have diversified the warnings \\nin it, that perhaps they would become right\\ufffeeous, or it may produce a lesson for them.\\n114. Exalted is Allah, the True King. Do not be \\nhasty with the Quran before its inspiration to \\nyou is concluded, and say, “My Lord, increase \\nme in knowledge.”\\n115. And We covenanted with Adam before, \\nbut he forgot, and We found in him no re\\ufffesolve.\\n116. And when We said to the angels, “Bow \\ndown to Adam.” They bowed down, except \\nfor Satan; he refused.\\n117. We said, “O Adam, this is an enemy to you \\nand to your wife. So do not let him make you \\nleave the Garden, for then you will suffer.\\n118. In it you will never go hungry, nor be na\\ufffeked.\\n119. Nor will you be thirsty in it, nor will you \\nswelter.”\\n120. But Satan whispered to him. He said, “O \\nAdam, shall I show you the Tree of Immor\\ufffetality, and a kingdom that never decays?”\\n121. And so they ate from it; whereupon their \\nbodies became visible to them, and they \\nstarted covering themselves with the leaves of \\nthe Garden. Thus Adam disobeyed his Lord, \\nand fell.\\n122. But then his Lord recalled him, and par\\ufffedoned him, and guided him.\\n123. He said, “Go down from it, altogether; \\nsome of you enemies of some others. But \\nwhenever guidance comes to you from Me, \\nwhoever follows My guidance, will not go \\nastray, nor suffer.\\n124. But whoever turns away from My Re\\ufffeminder, for him is a confined life. And We \\nwill raise him on the Day of Resurrection \\nblind.”\\n125. He will say, “My Lord, why did You raise \\nme blind, though I was seeing?”\\n126. He will say, “Just as Our revelations came \\nto you, and you forgot them, today you will \\nbe forgotten.”\\n127. Thus We recompense him who trans\\ufffegresses and does not believe in the revelations \\nof his Lord. The punishment of the Hereafter \\nis more severe, and more lasting.\\n128. Is it not instructive to them, how many \\ngenerations before them We destroyed, in \\n118\\n21. THE PROPHETS (al-Anbiya)\\nwhose settlements they walk? Surely in that \\nare signs for people of understanding.\\n129. Were it not for a word that issued from \\nyour Lord, the inevitable would have hap\\ufffepened, but there is an appointed term.\\n130. So bear patiently what they say, and cele\\ufffebrate the praises of your Lord before the ris\\ufffeing of the sun, and before its setting. And \\nduring the hours of the night glorify Him, \\nand at the borders of the day, that you may be \\nsatisfied.\\n131. And do not extend your glance towards \\nwhat We have given some classes of them to \\nenjoy—the splendor of the life of this world—\\nthat We may test them thereby. Your Lord’s \\nprovision is better, and more lasting.\\n132. And exhort your people to pray, and pa\\ufffetiently adhere to it. We ask of you no suste\\ufffenance, but it is We who sustain you. The good \\nending is that for righteousness.\\n133. And they say, “Why does he not bring us \\na miracle from his Lord?” Were they not \\ngiven enough miracles in the former scrip\\ufffetures?\\n134. Had We destroyed them with a punish\\ufffement before him, they would have said, “Our \\nLord, if only You had sent us a messenger, we \\nwould have followed Your revelations before \\nwe were humiliated and disgraced.”\\n135. Say, “Everybody is waiting, so wait. You \\nwill know who the people of the straight path \\nare, and who is rightly-guided.\\n21. THE PROPHETS\\n(al-Anbiya)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Mankind’s reckoning has drawn near, but \\nthey turn away heedlessly.\\n2. No fresh reminder comes to them from \\ntheir Lord, but they listen to it playfully.\\n3. Their hearts distracted, the wrongdoers \\nconfer secretly, “Is this anything but a mortal \\nlike you? Will you take to sorcery, with open\\ufffeeyes?”\\n4. He said, “My Lord knows what is said in the \\nheaven and the earth; and He is the Hearer, \\nthe Knower.”\\n5. And they said, “A jumble of dreams,” and, \\n“He made it up,” and, “He is a poet,” “let him \\nbring us a sign, like those sent to the an\\ufffecients.”\\n6. None of the towns We destroyed before \\nthem had believed. Will they, then, believe?\\n7. We did not send before you except men, \\nwhom We inspired. Ask the people of \\nknowledge, if you do not know.\\n8. We did not make them mere bodies that ate \\nno food, nor were they immortal. \\n9. Then We fulfilled Our promise to them, \\nand We saved them together with whomever \\nWe willed, and We destroyed the extrava\\ufffegant.\\n10. We have sent down to you a Book, contain\\ufffeing your message. Do you not understand?\\n11. How many a guilty town have We crushed, \\nand established thereafter another people?\\n12. Then, when they sensed Our might, they \\nstarted running away from it.\\n13. Do not run, but come back to your luxu\\uffferies, and to your homes, that you may be \\nquestioned.\\n14. They said, “Woe to us; we were unfair.”\\n15. This continued to be their cry, until We \\nmade them silent ashes.\\n16. We did not create the sky and the earth and \\nwhat is between them for amusement.\\n17. If We wanted amusement, We could have \\nfound it within Us, were We to do so.\\n18. In fact, We hurl the truth against falsehood, \\nand it crushes it, so it vanishes. Woe unto \\nyou, for what you describe.\\n19. To Him belongs everyone in the heavens \\nand the earth. Those near Him are not too \\nproud to worship Him, nor do they waver.\\n119\\n21. THE PROPHETS (al-Anbiya)\\n20. They praise night and day, without ever tir\\ufffeing.\\n21. Or have they taken to themselves gods \\nfrom the earth who resurrect?\\n22. If there were in them gods other than Al\\ufffelah, they would have gone to ruin. So glory be \\nto Allah, Lord of the Throne, beyond what \\nthey allege.\\n23. He will not be questioned about what He \\ndoes, but they will be questioned.\\n24. Or have they taken, besides Him, other \\ngods? Say, “Bring your proof. This is a mes\\ufffesage for those with me, and a message of \\nthose before me.” But most of them do not \\nknow the truth, so they turn away.\\n25. We never sent a messenger before you \\nwithout inspiring him that: “There is no god \\nbut I, so worship Me.”\\n26. And they say, “The Most Merciful has \\ntaken to himself a son.” Be He glorified; they \\nare but honored servants.\\n27. They never speak before He has spoken, \\nand they only act on His command.\\n28. He knows what is before them, and what is \\nbehind them; and they do not intercede ex\\ufffecept for him whom He approves; and they \\ntremble in awe of Him.\\n29. And whoever of them says, “I am a god be\\ufffesides Him,” We will reward him with Hell. \\nThus We reward the wrongdoers.\\n30. Do the disbelievers not see that the heavens \\nand the earth were one mass, and We tore \\nthem apart? And We made from water every \\nliving thing. Will they not believe?\\n31. And We placed on earth stabilizers, lest it \\nsways with them, and We placed therein \\nsignposts and passages, that they may be \\nguided.\\n32. And We made the sky a protected ceiling; \\nyet they turn away from its wonders. \\n33. It is He who created the night and the day, \\nand the sun and the moon; each floating in an \\norbit.\\n34. We did not grant immortality to any hu\\ufffeman being before you. Should you die, are \\nthey then the immortal?\\n35. Every soul will taste death. We burden you \\nwith adversity and prosperity—a test. And to \\nUs you will be returned.\\n36. When those who disbelieve see you, they \\ntreat you only with ridicule: “Is this the one \\nwho mentions your gods?” And they reject \\nthe mention of the Merciful.\\n37. The human being was created of haste. I \\nwill show you My signs, so do not seek to rush \\nMe.\\n38. And they say, “When will this promise \\ncome true, if you are truthful?”\\n39. If those who disbelieve only knew, when \\nthey cannot keep the fire off their faces and \\noff their backs, and they will not be helped.\\n40. In fact, it will come upon them suddenly, \\nand bewilder them. They will not be able to \\nrepel it, and they will not be reprieved.\\n41. Messengers before you were also ridiculed, \\nbut those who jeered were surrounded by \\nwhat they had ridiculed.\\n42. Say, “Who guards you against the Merciful \\nby night and by day?” But they turn away \\nfrom the mention of their Lord.\\n43. Or do they have gods who can defend them \\nagainst Us? They cannot help themselves, nor \\nwill they be protected from Us.\\n44. We have given these enjoyments, and their \\nancestors, until time grew long upon them. \\nDo they not see how We gradually reduce the \\nland from its extremities? Are they then the \\nvictors?\\n45. Say, “I am warning you through inspira\\ufffetion.” But the deaf cannot hear the call when \\nthey are being warned.\\n46. And when a breath of your Lord’s punish\\ufffement touches them, they say, “Woe to us, we \\nwere truly wicked.”\\n47. We will set up the scales of justice for the \\nDay of Resurrection, so that no soul will suf\\ufffefer the least injustice. And even if it be the \\n120\\n21. THE PROPHETS (al-Anbiya)\\nweight of a mustard-seed, We will bring it up. \\nSufficient are We as Reckoners.\\n48. We gave Moses and Aaron the Criterion, \\nand illumination, and a reminder for the \\nrighteous.\\n49. Those who fear their Lord in private, and \\nare apprehensive of the Hour.\\n50. This too is a blessed message that We re\\ufffevealed. Are you going to deny it?\\n51. We gave Abraham his integrity formerly, \\nand We knew him well.\\n52. When he said to his father and his people, \\n“What are these statues to which you are de\\ufffevoted?”\\n53. They said, “We found our parents wor\\ufffeshiping them.”\\n54. He said, “You and your parents are in evi\\ufffedent error.”\\n55. They said, “Are you telling us the truth, or \\nare you just playing?”\\n56. He said, “Your Lord is the Lord of the \\nheavens and the earth, the One who created \\nthem, and I bear witness to that.\\n57. “By Allah, I will have a plan for your statues \\nafter you have gone away.”\\n58. So he reduced them into pieces, except for \\ntheir biggest, that they may return to it.\\n59. They said, “Who did this to our gods? He \\nis certainly one of the wrongdoers.”\\n60. They said, “We heard a youth mentioning \\nthem. He is called Abraham.”\\n61. They said, “Bring him before the eyes of the \\npeople, so that they may witness.”\\n62. They said, “Are you the one who did this to \\nour gods, O Abraham?”\\n63. He said, “But it was this biggest of them \\nthat did it. Ask them, if they can speak.”\\n64. Then they turned to one another, and said, \\n“You yourselves are the wrongdoers.”\\n65. But they reverted to their old ideas: “You \\ncertainly know that these do not speak.”\\n66. He said, “Do you worship, instead of Allah, \\nwhat can neither benefit you in anything, nor \\nharm you?\\n67. Fie on you, and on what you worship in\\ufffestead of Allah. Do you not understand?”\\n68. They said, “Burn him and support your \\ngods, if you are going to act.”\\n69. We said, “O fire, be coolness and safety \\nupon Abraham.”\\n70. They planned to harm him, but We made \\nthem the worst losers.\\n71. And We delivered him, and Lot, to the land \\nthat We blessed for all people.\\n72. And We granted him Isaac and Jacob as a \\ngift; and each We made righteous.\\n73. And We made them leaders, guiding by \\nOur command; and We inspired them to do \\ngood works, and to observe the prayer, and to \\ngive out charity. They were devoted servants \\nto Us.\\n74. And Lot—We gave him judgment and \\nknowledge, and We delivered him from the \\ntown that practiced the abominations. They \\nwere wicked and perverted people.\\n75. And We admitted him into Our mercy; for \\nHe was one of the righteous.\\n76. And Noah, when he called before. So We \\nanswered him, and delivered him and his \\nfamily from the great disaster.\\n77. And We supported him against the people \\nwho rejected Our signs. They were an evil \\npeople, so We drowned them all.\\n78. And David and Solomon, when they gave \\njudgment in the case of the field, when some \\npeople’s sheep wandered therein by night; \\nand We were witnesses to their judgment.\\n79. And so We made Solomon understand it, \\nand to each We gave wisdom and knowledge. \\nAnd We subjected the mountains along with \\nDavid to sing Our praises, and the birds as \\nwell—surely We did.\\n80. And We taught him the making of shields \\nfor you, to protect you from your violence. \\nAre you, then, appreciative?\\n121\\n21. THE PROPHETS (al-Anbiya)\\n81. And to Solomon the stormy wind, blowing \\nat His command towards the land that We \\nhave blessed. We are aware of everything.\\n82. And of the devils were some that dived for \\nhim, and performed other, lesser tasks. But \\nWe kept them restrained.\\n83. And Job, when he cried out to his Lord: \\n“Great harm has afflicted me, and you are the \\nMost Merciful of the merciful.”\\n84. So We answered him, lifted his suffering, \\nand restored his family to him, and their like \\nwith them—a mercy from Us, and a reminder \\nfor the worshipers.\\n85. And Ishmael, and Enoch, and Ezekiel; each \\nwas one of the steadfast.\\n86. And We admitted them into Our mercy. \\nThey were among the righteous.\\n87. And Jonah, when he stormed out in fury, \\nthinking We had no power over him. But \\nthen He cried out in the darkness, “There is \\nno god but You! Glory to You! I was one of \\nthe wrongdoers!”\\n88. So We answered him, and saved him from \\nthe affliction. Thus We save the faithful.\\n89. And Zechariah, when he called out to his \\nLord, “My Lord, do not leave me alone, even \\nthough you are the Best of heirs.”\\n90. So We answered him, and gave him John. \\nAnd We cured his wife for him. They used to \\nvie in doing righteous deeds, and used to call \\non Us in love and awe, and they used to hum\\ufffeble themselves to Us.\\n91. And she who guarded her virginity. We \\nbreathed into her of Our spirit, and made her \\nand her son a sign to the world.\\n92. This community of yours is one commu\\ufffenity, and I am your Lord, so worship Me.\\n93. But they splintered themselves into fac\\ufffetions. They will all return to Us.\\n94. Whoever does righteous deeds, and is a be\\ufffeliever, his effort will not be denied. We are \\nwriting it down for him. \\n95. There is a ban on the town that We had de\\ufffestroyed—that they will not return.\\n96. Until, when Gog and Magog are let loose, \\nand they swarm down from every mound.\\n97. The promise of truth has drawn near. The \\neyes of those who disbelieved will stare in \\nhorror: “Woe to us. We were oblivious to \\nthis. In fact, we were wrongdoers.”\\n98. You and what you worship besides Allah \\nare fuel for Hell. You will descend into it.\\n99. Had these been gods, they would not have \\ndescended into it. All will abide in it.\\n100. In it they will wail. In it they will not hear.\\n101. As for those who deserved goodness from \\nUs—these will be kept away from it.\\n102. They will not hear its hissing, and they will \\nforever abide in what their hearts desire.\\n103. The Supreme Fear will not worry them, \\nand the angels will receive them: “This is your \\nDay which you were promised.”\\n104. On the Day when We fold the heaven, like \\nthe folding of a book. Just as We began the \\nfirst creation, We will repeat it—a promise \\nbinding on Us. We will act.\\n105. We have written in the Psalms, after the \\nReminder, that the earth will be inherited by \\nMy righteous servants.\\n106. Indeed, in this is a message for people who \\nworship.\\n107. We did not send you except as mercy to \\nmankind.\\n108. Say, “It is revealed to me that your God is \\nOne God. Are you going to submit?”\\n109. But if they turn away, say, “I have in\\ufffeformed you sufficiently. Although I do not \\nknow whether what you are promised is near \\nor far.”\\n110. He knows what is said openly, and He \\nknows what you conceal.\\n111. “And I do not know whether it is perhaps \\na trial for you, and an enjoyment for a while.”\\n112. He said, “My Lord, judge with justice.” \\nAnd, “Our Lord is the Gracious, Whose help \\nis sought against what you allege.”\\n122\\n22. THE PILGRIMAGE (al-Hajj)\\n22. THE PILGRIMAGE\\n(al-Hajj)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. O people, be conscious of your Lord. The \\nquaking of the Hour is a tremendous thing.\\n2. On the Day when you will see it: every nurs\\ufffeing mother will discard her infant, and every \\npregnant woman will abort her load, and you \\nwill see the people drunk, even though they \\nare not drunk—but the punishment of Allah \\nis severe.\\n3. Among the people is he who argues about \\nAllah without knowledge, and follows every \\ndefiant devil.\\n4. It was decreed for him, that whoever follows \\nhim—he will misguide him, and lead him to \\nthe torment of the Blaze.\\n5. O people! If you are in doubt about the Res\\ufffeurrection—We created you from dust, then \\nfrom a small drop, then from a clinging clot, \\nthen from a lump of flesh, partly developed \\nand partly undeveloped. In order to clarify \\nthings for you. And We settle in the wombs \\nwhatever We will for a designated term, and \\nthen We bring you out as infants, until you \\nreach your full strength. And some of you will \\npass away, and some of you will be returned \\nto the vilest age, so that he may not know, af\\ufffeter having known. And you see the earth still; \\nbut when We send down water on it, it vi\\ufffebrates, and swells, and grows all kinds of \\nlovely pairs.\\n6. That is because Allah is the truth, and be\\ufffecause He gives life to the dead, and because \\nHe is Capable of everything.\\n7. And because the Hour is coming—there is \\nno doubt about it—and because Allah will \\nresurrect those in the graves.\\n8. And among the people is he who argues \\nabout Allah without knowledge, or guidance, \\nor an enlightening scripture.\\n9. Turning aside in contempt, to lead away \\nfrom the path of Allah. He will have humilia\\ufffetion in this world, and on the Day of Resur\\uffferection We will make him taste the agony of \\nburning.\\n10. That is for what your hands have advanced, \\nand because Allah is not unjust to the serv\\ufffeants.\\n11. And among the people is he who worships \\nAllah on edge. When something good comes \\nhis way, he is content with it. But when an or\\ufffedeal strikes him, he makes a turnaround. He \\nloses this world and the next. That is the ob\\ufffevious loss.\\n12. He invokes, instead of Allah, what can nei\\ufffether harm him nor benefit him. That is the far \\nstraying.\\n13. He invokes one whose harm is closer than \\nhis benefit. What a miserable master. What a \\nmiserable companion.\\n14. Allah will admit those who believe and do \\nrighteous deeds into Gardens beneath which \\nrivers flow. Allah does whatever He wills.\\n15. Whoever thinks that Allah will not help \\nhim in this life and in the Hereafter—let him \\nturn to heaven, then sever, and see if his cun\\ufffening eliminates what enrages him.\\n16. Thus We revealed it as clarifying signs, and \\nAllah guides whomever He wills.\\n17. Those who believe, and those who are Jew\\ufffeish, and the Sabeans, and the Christians, and \\nthe Zoroastrians, and the Polytheists—Allah \\nwill judge between them on the Day of Res\\ufffeurrection. Allah is witness to all things.\\n18. Do you not realize that to Allah prostrates \\neveryone in the heavens and everyone on \\nearth, and the sun, and the moon, and the \\nstars, and the mountains, and the trees, and \\nthe animals, and many of the people? But \\nmany are justly deserving of punishment. \\nWhomever Allah shames, there is none to \\nhonor him. Allah does whatever He wills.\\n19. Here are two adversaries feuding regarding \\ntheir Lord. As for those who disbelieve, gar\\ufffements of fire will be tailored for them, and \\n123\\n22. THE PILGRIMAGE (al-Hajj)\\nscalding water will be poured over their \\nheads.\\n20. Melting their insides and their skins.\\n21. And they will have maces of iron.\\n22. Whenever they try to escape the gloom, \\nthey will be driven back to it: “Taste the suf\\ufffefering of burning.”\\n23. But Allah will admit those who believe and \\ndo good deeds into Gardens beneath which \\nrivers flow. They will be decorated therein \\nwith bracelets of gold and pearls, and their \\ngarments therein will be of silk.\\n24. They were guided to purity of speech. They \\nwere guided to the path of the Most Praised.\\n25. As for those who disbelieve and repel from \\nAllah’s path and from the Sacred Mosque—\\nwhich We have designated for all mankind \\nequally, whether residing therein or passing \\nthrough—and seek to commit sacrilege \\ntherein—We will make him taste of a painful \\npunishment.\\n26. We showed Abraham the location of the \\nHouse: “Do not associate anything with Me; \\nand purify My House for those who circle \\naround, and those who stand to pray, and \\nthose who kneel and prostrate.”\\n27. And announce the pilgrimage to human\\ufffeity. They will come to you on foot, and on \\nevery transport. They will come from every \\ndistant point.\\n28. That they may witness the benefits for \\nthemselves, and celebrate the name of Allah \\nduring the appointed days, for providing \\nthem with the animal livestock. So eat from \\nit, and feed the unfortunate poor.\\n29. Then let them perform their acts of cleans\\ufffeing, and fulfill their vows, and circle around \\nthe Ancient House.\\n30. All that. Whoever venerates the sanctities \\nof Allah—it is good for him with his Lord. All \\nlivestock are permitted to you, except what is \\nrecited to you. So stay away from the abomi\\ufffenation of idols, and stay away from perjury.\\n31. Being true to Allah, without associating an\\ufffeything with Him. Whoever associates any\\ufffething with Allah—it is as though he has fallen \\nfrom the sky, and is snatched by the birds, or \\nis swept away by the wind to a distant abyss.\\n32. So it is. Whoever venerates the sacraments \\nof Allah—it is from the piety of the hearts.\\n33. In them are benefits for you until a certain \\ntime. Then their place is by the Ancient \\nHouse.\\n34. We have appointed a rite for every nation, \\nthat they may commemorate Allah’s name \\nover the livestock He has provided for them. \\nYour God is One God, so to Him submit, and \\nannounce good news to the humble.\\n35. Those whose hearts tremble when Allah is \\nmentioned, and those who endure what has \\nbefallen them, and those who perform the \\nprayer and spend from what We have pro\\ufffevided for them.\\n36. We have made the animal offerings em\\ufffeblems of Allah for you. In them is goodness \\nfor you. So pronounce Allah’s name upon \\nthem as they line up. Then, when they have \\nfallen on their sides, eat of them and feed the \\ncontented and the beggar. Thus We have sub\\ufffejected them to you, that you may be thankful.\\n37. Neither their flesh, nor their blood, ever \\nreaches Allah. What reaches Him is the right\\ufffeeousness from you. Thus He subdued them \\nto you, that you may glorify Allah for guiding \\nyou. And give good news to the charitable.\\n38. Allah defends those who believe. Allah \\ndoes not love any ungrateful traitor.\\n39. Permission is given to those who are \\nfought against, and Allah is Able to give them \\nvictory.\\n40. Those who were unjustly evicted from \\ntheir homes, merely for saying, “Our Lord is \\nAllah.” Were it not that Allah repels people \\nby means of others: monasteries, churches, \\nsynagogues, and mosques—where the name \\nof Allah is mentioned much—would have \\nbeen demolished. Allah supports whoever \\nsupports Him. Allah is Strong and Mighty.\\n124\\n22. THE PILGRIMAGE (al-Hajj)\\n41. Those who, when We empower them in the \\nland, observe the prayer, and give regular \\ncharity, and command what is right, and for\\ufffebid what is wrong. To Allah belongs the out\\ufffecome of events.\\n42. If they deny you—before them the people \\nof Noah, and Aad, and Thamood also denied.\\n43. And the people of Abraham, and the peo\\ufffeple of Lot.\\n44. And the inhabitants of Median. And Moses \\nwas denied. Then I reprieved those who dis\\ufffebelieved, but then I seized them. So how was \\nMy rejection?\\n45. How many a town have We destroyed \\nwhile it was doing wrong? They lie in ruins; \\nwith stilled wells, and lofty mansions.\\n46. Have they not journeyed in the land, and \\nhad minds to reason with, or ears to listen \\nwith? It is not the eyes that go blind, but it is \\nthe hearts, within the chests, that go blind.\\n47. And they ask you to hasten the punish\\ufffement. But Allah never breaks His promise. A \\nday with your Lord is like a thousand years of \\nyour count.\\n48. How many a town have I reprieved, alt\\ufffehough it was unjust? Then I seized it. To Me \\nis the destination.\\n49. Say, “O people, I am only a plain warner to \\nyou.”\\n50. Those who believe and work righteous\\ufffeness—for them is forgiveness and a generous \\nprovision.\\n51. But those who strive against Our revela\\ufffetions—these are the inmates of Hell.\\n52. We never sent a messenger before you, or \\na prophet, but when he had a desire Satan in\\ufffeterfered in his wishes. But Allah nullifies what \\nSatan interjects, and Allah affirms His revela\\ufffetions. Allah is Omniscient and Wise.\\n53. In order to make Satan’s suggestions a trial \\nfor those whose hearts are diseased, and those \\nwhose hearts are hardened. The wrongdoers \\nare in profound discord.\\n54. And so that those endowed with \\nknowledge may know that it is the truth from \\nyour Lord, and so believe in it, and their \\nhearts soften to it. Allah guides those who be\\ufffelieve to a straight path.\\n55. Those who disbelieve will continue to be \\nhesitant about it, until the Hour comes upon \\nthem suddenly, or there comes to them the \\ntorment of a desolate Day.\\n56. Sovereignty on that Day belongs to Allah; \\nHe will judge between them. Those who be\\ufffelieve and do good deeds will be in the Gar\\ufffedens of Bliss.\\n57. But those who disbelieve and reject Our \\nrevelations—these will have a humiliating \\npunishment.\\n58. Those who emigrate in Allah’s cause, then \\nget killed, or die, Allah will provide them with \\nfine provisions. Allah is the Best of Providers.\\n59. He will admit them an admittance that will \\nplease them. Allah is Knowing and Clement.\\n60. That is so! Whoever retaliates similarly to \\nthe affliction he was made to suffer, and then \\nhe is wronged again, Allah will definitely as\\ufffesist him. Allah is Pardoning and Forgiving.\\n61. That is because Allah merges the night into \\nthe day, and He merges the day into the night,\\nand because Allah is Hearing and Seeing.\\n62. That is because Allah is the Reality, and \\nwhat they invoke besides Him is vanity, and \\nbecause Allah is the Sublime, the Grand.\\n63. Do you not see that Allah sends down wa\\ufffeter from the sky, and the land becomes green? \\nAllah is Kind and Aware.\\n64. To Him belongs everything in the heavens \\nand everything on earth. Allah is the Rich, the \\nPraised.\\n65. Do you not see that Allah made everything \\non earth subservient to you? How the ships \\nsail at sea by His command? That He holds \\nup the sky lest it falls on earth—except by His \\npermission? Allah is Gracious towards the \\npeople, Most Merciful.\\n125\\n23. THE BELIEVERS (al-Mu’minun)\\n66. And it is He who gives you life, then makes \\nyou die, then revives you. The human being \\nis unappreciative. \\n67. For every congregation We have appointed \\nacts of devotion, which they observe. So do \\nnot let them dispute with you in this matter. \\nAnd invite to your Lord; you are upon a \\nstraight guidance.\\n68. But if they dispute with you, say, “Allah is \\nfully aware of what you do.”\\n69. Allah will judge between you on the Day of \\nResurrection regarding what you disagree \\nabout.\\n70. Do you not know that Allah knows every\\ufffething in the heavens and the earth? This is in \\na book. That is easy for Allah.\\n71. Yet they worship, besides Allah, things for \\nwhich He sent down no warrant, and what \\nthey have no knowledge of. There is no savior \\nfor the transgressors.\\n72. And when Our Clear Verses are recited to \\nthem, you will recognize disgust on the faces \\nof those who disbelieve. They nearly assault \\nthose who recite to them Our Verses. Say, \\n“Shall I inform you of something worse than \\nthat? The Fire! Allah has promised it to those \\nwho disbelieve. And what a wretched out\\ufffecome!”\\n73. O people! A parable is presented, so listen \\nto it: Those you invoke besides Allah will \\nnever create a fly, even if they banded to\\ufffegether for that purpose. And if the fly steals \\nanything from them, they cannot recover it \\nfrom it. Weak are the pursuer and the pur\\ufffesued.\\n74. They do not value Allah as He should be \\nvalued. Allah is Strong and Powerful.\\n75. Allah chooses messengers from among the \\nangels, and from among the people. Allah is \\nHearing and Seeing.\\n76. He knows what is before them, and what is \\nbehind them. To Allah all matters are re\\ufffeferred.\\n77. O you who believe! Kneel, and prostrate, \\nand worship your Lord, and do good deeds, \\nso that you may succeed.\\n78. And strive for Allah, with the striving due \\nto Him. He has chosen you, and has not bur\\ufffedened you in religion—the faith of your fa\\ufffether Abraham. It is he who named you Mus\\ufffelims before, and in this. So that the Messen\\ufffeger may be a witness over you, and you may \\nbe witnesses over the people. So pray regu\\ufffelarly, and give regular charity, and cleave to \\nAllah. He is your Protector. What an excel\\ufffelent Protector, and what an excellent Helper.\\n23. THE BELIEVERS\\n(al-Mu’minun)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Successful are the believers.\\n2. Those who are humble in their prayers.\\n3. Those who avoid nonsense.\\n4. Those who work for charity.\\n5. Those who safeguard their chastity.\\n6. Except from their spouses, or their depend\\ufffeents—for then they are free from blame.\\n7. But whoever seeks anything beyond that—\\nthese are the transgressors.\\n8. Those who are faithful to their trusts and \\npledges.\\n9. Those who safeguard their prayers.\\n10. These are the inheritors.\\n11. Who will inherit Paradise, wherein they \\nwill dwell forever.\\n12. We created man from an extract of clay.\\n13. Then We made him a seed, in a secure re\\ufffepository.\\n14. Then We developed the seed into a clot. \\nThen We developed the clot into a lump. \\nThen We developed the lump into bones. \\nThen We clothed the bones with flesh. Then \\nWe produced it into another creature. Most \\nBlessed is Allah, the Best of Creators.\\n126\\n23. THE BELIEVERS (al-Mu’minun)\\n15. Then, after that, you will die.\\n16. Then, on the Day of Resurrection, you will \\nbe resurrected.\\n17. We created above you seven pathways, and \\nWe are never heedless of the creation.\\n18. And We sent down water from the sky in \\nproper quantity, and settled it in the ground, \\nand We are Able to take it away.\\n19. With it We produce for you gardens of \\npalms and vines, yielding abundant fruit for \\nyou to eat.\\n20. And a tree springing out of Mount Sinai, \\nproducing oil, and seasoning for those who \\neat.\\n21. And there is a lesson for you in livestock: \\nWe give you to drink from what is in their \\nbellies, and you have many benefits in them, \\nand from them you eat.\\n22. And on them, and on the ships, you are \\ntransported.\\n23. We sent Noah to his people. He said, “O \\nmy people, worship Allah, you have no deity \\nother than Him. Will you not take heed?”\\n24. But the notables of his people, who disbe\\ufffelieved, said, “This is nothing but a human like \\nyou, who wants to gain superiority over you. \\nHad Allah willed, He would have sent down \\nangels. We never heard of this from our fore\\ufffefathers of old.\\n25. He is nothing but a man possessed. Just ig\\ufffenore him for a while.”\\n26. He said, “My Lord, help me, for they have \\nrejected me.” \\n27. So We inspired him: “Build the Ark under \\nOur observation and by Our inspiration. And \\nwhen Our decree comes to pass, and the oven \\nboils over, load into it two pairs of every kind, \\ntogether with your family, except those of \\nthem against whom the word has already \\nbeen pronounced. And do not speak to me \\nconcerning those who did wrong; for they are \\nto be drowned.”\\n28. Then, when you and those with you are set\\ufffetled in the Ark, say, “Praise be to Allah, who \\nhas saved us from the wrongdoing people.”\\n29. And say, “My Lord, land me with a blessed \\nlanding, as you are the best of transporters.”\\n30. Surely in that are signs. We are always test\\ufffeing.\\n31. Then, after them, We established another \\ngeneration.\\n32. And We sent among them a messenger \\nfrom themselves: “Serve Allah. You have no \\ngod other than Him. Will you not be cau\\ufffetious?”\\n33. But the dignitaries of his people, those who \\ndisbelieved and denied the meeting of the \\nHereafter, and We had indulged them in the \\npresent life, said, “This is nothing but a hu\\ufffeman like you; he eats what you eat, and he \\ndrinks what you drink.\\n34. If you obey a human being like yourselves, \\nthen you will be losers.\\n35. Does he promise you that when you have \\ndied and become dust and bones, you will be \\nbrought out?\\n36. Farfetched, farfetched is what you are \\npromised.\\n37. There is nothing but our life in this world. \\nWe die, and we live, and we are not resur\\uffferected.\\n38. He is nothing but a man, making up lies \\nabout Allah. We have no faith in him.”\\n39. He said, “My Lord, help me, for they have \\nrejected me.”\\n40. He said, “Soon they will be filled with re\\ufffegret.”\\n41. Then the Blast struck them, justifiably, and \\nWe turned them into scum. So away with the \\nwicked people.\\n42. Then, after them, We raised other genera\\ufffetions.\\n43. No nation can advance its time, nor can \\nthey postpone it.\\n127\\n23. THE BELIEVERS (al-Mu’minun)\\n44. Then We sent Our messengers in succes\\ufffesion. Every time a messenger came to his \\ncommunity, they called him a liar. So We \\nmade them follow one another, and made \\nthem history. So away with a people who do \\nnot believe.\\n45. Then We sent Moses and his brother Aa\\uffferon, with Our signs and a clear authority.\\n46. To Pharaoh and his nobles, but they turned \\narrogant. They were oppressive people.\\n47. They said, “Are we to believe in two mor\\ufffetals like us, and their people are our slaves?”\\n48. So they called them liars, and thus were \\namong those destroyed.\\n49. And We gave Moses the Scripture, that \\nthey may be guided.\\n50. And We made Mary’s son and his mother \\na sign, and We sheltered them on high \\nground with security and flowing springs.\\n51. O messengers, eat of the good things, and \\nact with integrity. I am aware of what you do.\\n52. This nation of yours is one nation, and I \\nam your Lord, so fear Me.\\n53. But they tore themselves into sects; each \\nparty happy with what they have.\\n54. So leave them in their bewilderment until \\na time.\\n55. Do they assume that, in furnishing them \\nwith wealth and children.\\n56. We race to give them the good things? In \\nfact, they have no idea.\\n57. Those who, from awe of their Lord, are \\nfearful.\\n58. And those who believe in their Lord’s \\nVerses.\\n59. And those who associate no partners with \\ntheir Lord.\\n60. And those who give what they give, while \\ntheir hearts quake, knowing that to their Lord \\nthey will return.\\n61. It is they who race towards goodness. It is \\nthey who will reach it first.\\n62. We never burden any soul beyond its ca\\ufffepacity. And with Us is a record that tells the \\ntruth, and they will not be wronged.\\n63. But their hearts are puzzled because of this; \\nand they have deeds that do not conform to \\nthis, which they continue to perpetrate.\\n64. Until, when We seize the decadent among \\nthem with torment, they begin to groan.\\n65. Do not groan today. You will receive no \\nhelp from Us.\\n66. My Verses were recited to you, but you \\nturned back on your heels.\\n67. Arrogant towards it—talked nonsense \\nabout it—disregarded it.\\n68. Have they not pondered the Word? Or has \\nthere come to them what came not to their \\nforefathers of old?\\n69. Or is it that they did not recognize their \\nmessenger, so they are denying him?\\n70. Or do they say, “He is possessed?” In fact, \\nhe brought them the truth, but most of them \\nhate the truth.\\n71. If the truth conformed to their desires, the \\nheavens, the earth, and everyone in them \\nwould have gone to ruin. In fact, We have \\ngiven them their message, but they keep \\navoiding their message.\\n72. Or are you asking them for a payment? The \\nrevenue from your Lord is better, and He is \\nthe Best of providers.\\n73. You are inviting them to a straight path.\\n74. But those who do not believe in the Here\\ufffeafter are swerving from the path.\\n75. Even if We had mercy on them, and re\\ufffelieved their problems, they would still blindly \\npersist in their defiance.\\n76. We have already gripped them with suffer\\ufffeing, but they did not surrender to their Lord, \\nnor did they humble themselves.\\n77. Until, when We have opened before them \\na gate of intense agony, at once they will des\\ufffepair.\\n128\\n23. THE BELIEVERS (al-Mu’minun)\\n78. It is He who produced for you the hearing, \\nand the eyesight, and the feelings. But little \\ngratitude you show.\\n79. And it is He who multiplied you on earth, \\nand to Him you will be gathered.\\n80. And it is He who gives life and brings \\ndeath, and to Him is the alternation of night \\nand day. Do you not understand?\\n81. But they say the like of what the ancients \\nsaid.\\n82. They say, “After we have died, and become \\ndust and bones, will we be resurrected?\\n83. We were promised this before—we and \\nour ancestors—these are nothing but legends \\nof the ancients.”\\n84. Say, “To whom does the earth belong, and \\neveryone in it, if you happen to know?” \\n85. They will say, “To Allah.” Say, “Will you \\nnot reflect?”\\n86. Say, “Who is the Lord of the seven heavens, \\nand Lord of the Splendid Throne?”\\n87. They will say, “To Allah.” Say, “Will you \\nnot become righteous?”\\n88. Say, “In whose hand is the dominion of all \\nthings, and He protects and cannot be pro\\ufffetected from, if you happen to know?”\\n89. They will say, “To Allah.” Say, “Then are \\nyou bewitched?”\\n90. In fact, We have given them the truth, and \\nthey are liars.\\n91. Allah has never begotten a son, nor is there \\nany god besides Him. Otherwise, each god \\nwould have taken away what it has created, \\nand some of them would have gained su\\ufffepremacy over others. Glory be to Allah, far \\nbeyond what they describe.\\n92. The Knower of the hidden and the mani\\ufffefest. He is exalted, far above what they asso\\ufffeciate.\\n93. Say, “My Lord, if You would show me what \\nthey are promised.\\n94. My Lord, do not place me among the \\nwicked people.”\\n95. We are surely Able to show you what We \\npromise them.\\n96. Repel evil by what is better. We are aware \\nof what they describe.\\n97. And say, “My Lord, I seek refuge with You \\nfrom the urgings of the devils.\\n98. And I seek refuge with You, my Lord, lest \\nthey become present.”\\n99. Until, when death comes to one of them, \\nhe says, “My Lord, send me back.\\n100. That I may do right in what I have ne\\ufffeglected.” By no means! It is just a word that \\nhe utters. And behind them is a barrier, until \\nthe Day they are resurrected.\\n101. When the Horn is blown, no relations be\\ufffetween them will exist on that Day, and they \\nwill not ask after one another.\\n102. Those whose scales are heavy—those are \\nthe successful.\\n103. But those whose scales are light—those are \\nthey who have lost their souls; in Hell they \\nwill dwell forever.\\n104. The Fire lashes their faces, and therein \\nthey grimace.\\n105. “Were not My revelations recited to you, \\nand you kept on rejecting them?”\\n106. They will say, “Our Lord, our wretched\\ufffeness prevailed over us, and we were a people \\nastray.\\n107. Our Lord! Bring us out of this. If we ever \\nreturned, we would truly be evil.”\\n108. He will say, “Be despised therein, and do \\nnot speak to Me.\\n109. There was a group of My servants who \\nwould say, `Our Lord, we have believed, so \\nforgive us, and have mercy on us; You are the \\nBest of the merciful.'\\n110. But you made them a target of ridicule, \\nuntil they made you forget My remembrance; \\nand you used to laugh at them.\\n111. Today, I have rewarded them for their en\\ufffedurance. They are the ones who are the tri\\ufffeumphant.”\\n129\\n24. THE LIGHT (an-Nur)\\n112. He will say, “How many years did you re\\ufffemain on earth?”\\n113. They will say, “We remained a day, or part \\nof a day; but ask those who keep count.”\\n114. He will say, “You remained only for a little \\nwhile, if you only knew.\\n115. Did you think that We created you in vain, \\nand that to Us you will not be returned?”\\n116. So Exalted is Allah, the Ruler, the Real. \\nThere is no god except He, the Lord of the \\nNoble Throne.\\n117. Whoever invokes another god besides Al\\ufffelah—he has no proof thereof—his reckoning \\nrests with his Lord. The disbelievers will not \\nsucceed.\\n118. And say, “My Lord, forgive and have \\nmercy, for You are the Best of the merciful.”\\n24. THE LIGHT\\n(an-Nur)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. A chapter that We have revealed, and made \\nobligatory, and revealed in it clear Verses, \\nthat you may take heed.\\n2. The adulteress and the adulterer—whip \\neach one of them a hundred lashes, and let no \\npity towards them overcome you regarding \\nAllah’s Law, if you believe in Allah and the \\nLast Day. And let a group of believers witness \\ntheir punishment.\\n3. The adulterer shall marry none but an adul\\ufffeteress or an idolatress; and the adulteress \\nshall marry none but an adulterer or an idol\\ufffeater. That has been prohibited for the believ\\ufffeers.\\n4. Those who accuse chaste women, then can\\ufffenot bring four witnesses, whip them eighty \\nlashes, and do not ever accept their testi\\ufffemony. For these are the immoral.\\n5. Except for those who repent afterwards, and \\nreform; for Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.\\n6. As for those who accuse their own spouses, \\nbut have no witnesses except themselves, the \\ntestimony of one of them is equivalent to four \\ntestimonies, if he swears by Allah that he is \\ntruthful.\\n7. And the fifth time, that Allah’s curse be \\nupon him, if he is a liar.\\n8. But punishment shall be averted from her, \\nif she swears four times by Allah, that he is a \\nliar.\\n9. And the fifth time, that Allah’s wrath be \\nupon her, if he is truthful.\\n10. Were it not for Allah’s grace upon you, and \\nHis mercy, and that Allah is Conciliatory and \\nWise.\\n11. Those who perpetrated the slander are a \\nband of you. Do not consider it bad for you, \\nbut it is good for you. Each person among \\nthem bears his share in the sin. As for him \\nwho played the major role—for him is a ter\\uffferible punishment.\\n12. Why, when you heard about it, the believ\\ufffeing men and women did not think well of one \\nanother, and say, “This is an obvious lie”?\\n13. Why did they not bring four witnesses to \\ntestify to it? If they fail to bring the witnesses, \\nthen in Allah’s sight, they are liars.\\n14. Were it not for Allah’s favor upon you, and \\nHis mercy, in this world and the Hereafter, \\nyou would have suffered a great punishment \\nfor what you have ventured into.\\n15. When you rumored it with your tongues, \\nand spoke with your mouths what you had no \\nknowledge of, and you considered it trivial; \\nbut according to Allah, it is serious.\\n16. When you heard it, you should have said, \\n“It is not for us to repeat this. By Your glory, \\nthis is a serious slander.”\\n17. Allah cautions you never to return to the \\nlike of it, if you are believers.\\n18. Allah explains the Verses to you. Allah is \\nKnowing and Wise.\\n19. Those who love to see immorality spread \\namong the believers—for them is a painful \\n130\\n24. THE LIGHT (an-Nur)\\npunishment, in this life and in the Hereafter. \\nAllah knows, and you do not know.\\n20. Were it not for Allah’s grace upon you, and \\nHis mercy, and that Allah is Clement and \\nMerciful.\\n21. O you who believe! Do not follow Satan’s \\nfootsteps. Whoever follows Satan’s foot\\ufffesteps—he advocates obscenity and immoral\\ufffeity. Were it not for Allah’s grace towards you, \\nand His mercy, not one of you would have \\nbeen pure, ever. But Allah purifies whomever \\nHe wills. Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.\\n22. Those of you who have affluence and \\nmeans should not refuse to give to the rela\\ufffetives, and the needy, and the emigrants for \\nthe sake of Allah. And let them pardon, and \\nlet them overlook. Do you not love for Allah \\nto pardon you? Allah is All-Forgiving, Most \\nMerciful.\\n23. Those who slander honorable, innocent, \\nbelieving women are cursed in this life and in \\nthe Hereafter. They will have a terrible pun\\ufffeishment.\\n24. On the Day when their tongues, and their \\nhands, and their feet will testify against them \\nregarding what they used to do.\\n25. On that Day, Allah will pay them their ac\\ufffecount in full, and they will know that Allah is \\nthe Evident Reality.\\n26. Bad women are for bad men, and bad men \\nare for bad women, and good women are for \\ngood men, and good men are for good \\nwomen. Those are acquitted of what they say. \\nThere is forgiveness for them, and a generous \\nprovision.\\n27. O you who believe! Do not enter homes \\nother than your own, until you have asked \\npermission and greeted their occupants. That \\nis better for you, that you may be aware.\\n28. And if you find no one in them, do not en\\ufffeter them until you are given permission. And \\nif it is said to you, “Turn back,” then turn \\nback. That is more proper for you. Allah is \\naware of what you do.\\n29. There is no blame on you for entering un\\ufffeinhabited houses, in which are belongings of \\nyours. Allah knows what you reveal and what \\nyou conceal.\\n30. Tell the believing men to restrain their \\nlooks, and to guard their privates. That is \\npurer for them. Allah is cognizant of what \\nthey do.\\n31. And tell the believing women to restrain \\ntheir looks, and to guard their privates, and \\nnot display their beauty except what is appar\\ufffeent thereof, and to draw their coverings over \\ntheir breasts, and not expose their beauty ex\\ufffecept to their husbands, their fathers, their \\nhusbands' fathers, their sons, their husbands' \\nsons, their brothers, their brothers' sons, their \\nsisters' sons, their women, what their right \\nhands possess, their male attendants who \\nhave no sexual desires, or children who are \\nnot yet aware of the nakedness of women. \\nAnd they should not strike their feet to draw \\nattention to their hidden beauty. And repent \\nto Allah, all of you believers, so that you may \\nsucceed.\\n32. And wed the singles among you, and those \\nwho are fit among your servants and maids. \\nIf they are poor, Allah will enrich them from \\nHis bounty. Allah is All-Encompassing, All\\ufffeKnowing.\\n33. And let those who do not find the means to \\nmarry abstain, until Allah enriches them \\nfrom His bounty. If any of your servants wish \\nto be freed, grant them their wish, if you rec\\ufffeognize some good in them. And give them of \\nAllah’s wealth which he has given you. And \\ndo not compel your girls to prostitution, \\nseeking the materials of this life, if they desire \\nto remain chaste. Should anyone compel \\nthem—after their compulsion, Allah is For\\ufffegiving and Merciful.\\n34. We have sent down to you clarifying reve\\ufffelations, and examples of those who passed on \\nbefore you, and advice for the righteous.\\n35. Allah is the Light of the heavens and the \\nearth. The allegory of His light is that of a pil\\ufffelar on which is a lamp. The lamp is within a \\nglass. The glass is like a brilliant planet, fueled \\n131\\n24. THE LIGHT (an-Nur)\\nby a blessed tree, an olive tree, neither eastern \\nnor western. Its oil would almost illuminate, \\neven if no fire has touched it. Light upon \\nLight. Allah guides to His light whomever He \\nwills. Allah thus cites the parables for the peo\\ufffeple. Allah is cognizant of everything.\\n36. In houses which Allah has permitted to be \\nraised, and His name is celebrated therein. \\nHe is glorified therein, morning and evening.\\n37. By men who neither trading nor commerce \\ndistracts them from Allah’s remembrance, \\nand from performing the prayers, and from \\ngiving alms. They fear a Day when hearts and \\nsights are overturned.\\n38. Allah will reward them according to the \\nbest of what they did, and He will increase \\nthem from His bounty. Allah provides for \\nwhomever He wills without reckoning.\\n39. As for those who disbelieve, their works are \\nlike a mirage in a desert. The thirsty assumes \\nit is to be water. Until, when he has reached \\nit, he finds it to be nothing, but there he finds \\nAllah, Who settles his account in full. Allah is \\nswift in reckoning.\\n40. Or like utter darkness in a vast ocean, cov\\ufffeered by waves, above which are waves, above \\nwhich is fog. Darkness upon darkness. If he \\nbrings out his hand, he will hardly see it. He \\nto whom Allah has not granted a light has no \\nlight.\\n41. Do you not realize that Allah is glorified by \\nwhatever is in the heavens and the earth, and \\neven by the birds in formation? Each knows \\nits prayer and its manner of praise. Allah \\nknows well what they do.\\n42. To Allah belongs the dominion of the \\nheavens and the earth, and to Allah is the ul\\ufffetimate return.\\n43. Have you not seen how Allah propels the \\nclouds, then brings them together, then piles \\nthem into a heap, and you see rain drops \\nemerging from its midst? How He brings \\ndown loads of hail from the sky, striking with \\nit whomever He wills, and diverting it from \\nwhomever He wills? The flash of its lighten\\ufffeing almost snatches the sight away.\\n44. Allah alternates the night and the day. In \\nthat is a lesson for those who have insight.\\n45. Allah created every living creature from \\nwater. Some of them crawl on their bellies, \\nand some walk on two feet, and others walk \\non four. Allah creates whatever He wills. Al\\ufffelah is Capable of everything.\\n46. We sent down enlightening revelations, \\nand Allah guides whomever He wills to a \\nstraight path.\\n47. And they say, “We have believed in Allah \\nand the Messenger, and we obey,” but some \\nof them turn away afterwards. These are not \\nbelievers.\\n48. And when they are called to Allah and His \\nMessenger, in order to judge between them, \\nsome of them refuse.\\n49. But if justice is on their side, they accept it \\nwillingly.\\n50. Is there sickness in their hearts? Or are they \\nsuspicious? Or do they fear that Allah may do \\nthem injustice? Or His Messenger? In fact, \\nthey themselves are the unjust.\\n51. The response of the believers, when they \\nare called to Allah and His Messenger in or\\ufffeder to judge between them, is to say, “We \\nhear and we obey.” These are the successful.\\n52. Whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, \\nand fears Allah, and is conscious of Him—\\nthese are the winners.\\n53. And they swear by Allah with their solemn \\noaths, that if you commanded them, they \\nwould mobilize. Say, “Do not swear. Obedi\\ufffeence will be recognized. Allah is experienced \\nwith what you do.”\\n54. Say, “Obey Allah and obey the Messenger.” \\nBut if they turn away, then he is responsible \\nfor his obligations, and you are responsible \\nfor your obligations. And if you obey him, \\nyou will be guided. It is only incumbent on \\nthe Messenger to deliver the Clarifying Mes\\ufffesage.\\n55. Allah has promised those of you who be\\ufffelieve and do righteous deeds, that He will \\nmake them successors on earth, as He made \\n132\\n25. THE CRITERION (al-Furqan)\\nthose before them successors, and He will es\\ufffetablish for them their religion—which He has \\napproved for them—and He will substitute \\nsecurity in place of their fear. They worship \\nMe, never associating anything with Me. But \\nwhoever disbelieves after that—these are the \\nsinners.\\n56. Pray regularly, and give regular charity, \\nand obey the Messenger, so that you may re\\ufffeceive mercy.\\n57. Never think that those who disbelieve can \\nescape on earth. Their place is the Fire; a mis\\ufffeerable destination.\\n58. O you who believe! Permission must be re\\ufffequested by your servants and those of you \\nwho have not reached puberty. On three oc\\ufffecasions: before the Dawn Prayer, and at noon \\nwhen you change your clothes, and after the \\nEvening Prayer. These are three occasions of \\nprivacy for you. At other times, it is not \\nwrong for you or them to intermingle with \\none another. Allah thus clarifies the revela\\ufffetions for you. Allah is Knowledgeable and \\nWise.\\n59. When the children among you reach pu\\ufffeberty, they must ask permission, as those be\\ufffefore them asked permission. Allah thus clari\\ufffefies His revelations for you. Allah is Knowl\\ufffeedgeable and Wise.\\n60. Women past the age of childbearing, who \\nhave no desire for marriage, commit no \\nwrong by taking off their outer clothing, pro\\ufffevided they do not flaunt their finery. But to \\nmaintain modesty is better for them. Allah is \\nHearing and Knowing.\\n61. There is no blame on the blind, nor any \\nblame on the lame, nor any blame on the sick, \\nnor on yourselves for eating at your homes, \\nor your fathers’ homes, or your mothers’ \\nhomes, or your brothers’ homes, or your sis\\ufffeters’ homes, or the homes of your paternal \\nuncles, or the homes of your paternal aunts, \\nor the homes of your maternal uncles, or the \\nhomes of your maternal aunts, or those \\nwhose keys you own, or the homes of your \\nfriends. You commit no wrong by eating to\\ufffegether or separately. But when you enter any \\nhome, greet one another with a greeting from \\nAllah, blessed and good. Allah thus explains \\nthe revelations for you, so that you may un\\ufffederstand.\\n62. The believers are those who believe in Al\\ufffelah and His Messenger, and when they are \\nwith him for a matter of common interest, \\nthey do not leave until they have asked him \\nfor permission. Those who ask your permis\\ufffesion are those who believe in Allah and His \\nMessenger. So when they ask your permis\\ufffesion to attend to some affair of theirs, give \\npermission to any of them you wish, and ask \\nAllah’s forgiveness for them. Allah is Forgiv\\ufffeing and Merciful.\\n63. Do not address the Messenger in the same \\nmanner you address one another. Allah \\nknows those of you who slip away using \\nflimsy excuses. So let those who oppose his \\norders beware, lest an ordeal strikes them, or \\na painful punishment befalls them.\\n64. Surely, to Allah belongs everything in the \\nheavens and the earth. He knows what you \\nare about. And on the Day they are returned \\nto Him, He will inform them of what they \\ndid. Allah has full knowledge of all things.\\n25. THE CRITERION\\n(al-Furqan)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Blessed is He who sent down the Criterion \\nupon His servant, to be a warning to human\\ufffeity.\\n2. He to whom belongs the kingdom of the \\nheavens and the earth, who took to Himself \\nno son, who never had a partner in His king\\ufffeship; who created everything and determined \\nits measure.\\n3. And yet, instead of Him, they produce for \\nthemselves gods that create nothing, but are \\nthemselves created; that have no power to \\nharm or benefit themselves; and no power \\nover life, death, or resurrection.\\n133\\n25. THE CRITERION (al-Furqan)\\n4. Those who disbelieve say, “This is nothing \\nbut a lie that he made up, and others have \\nhelped him at it.” They have committed an \\ninjustice and a perjury.\\n5. And they say, “Tales of the ancients; he \\nwrote them down; they are dictated to him \\nmorning and evening.”\\n6. Say, “It was revealed by He who knows the \\nSecret in the heavens and the earth. He is al\\ufffeways Forgiving and Merciful.”\\n7. And they say, “What sort of messenger is \\nthis, who eats food, and walks in the market\\ufffeplaces? If only an angel was sent down with \\nhim, to be alongside him a warner.”\\n8. Or, “If only a treasure was dropped on \\nhim.” Or, “If only he had a garden from \\nwhich he eats.” The evildoers also say, “You \\nare following but a man under spell.”\\n9. Look how they invent examples for you. \\nThey have gone astray, and cannot find a \\nway.\\n10. Blessed is He who, if He wills, can provide \\nyou with better than that—gardens beneath \\nwhich rivers flow—and He will give you pal\\ufffeaces.\\n11. In fact, they have denied the Hour, and We \\nhave prepared for those who deny the Hour a \\nBlaze.\\n12. When it sees them from a distant place, \\nthey will hear it raging and roaring.\\n13. And when they are thrown into it, into a \\ntight place, shackled, they will plead there for \\ndeath.\\n14. “Do not plead for one death today, but \\nplead for a great many deaths.”\\n15. Say, “Is this better, or the Garden of Eter\\ufffenity promised to the righteous? It is for them \\na reward and a destination.\\n16. They will have therein whatever they de\\ufffesire, forever. That is upon your Lord a bind\\ufffeing promise.\\n17. On the Day when He gathers them, and \\nwhat they worshiped besides Allah, He will \\nsay, “Was it you who misled these servants of \\nMine, or was it they who lost the way?”\\n18. They will say, “Glory be to You. It was not \\nfor us to take any lords besides You. But you \\ngave them enjoyments, and their ancestors, \\nuntil they forgot the Message, and became ru\\ufffeined people.”\\n19. They have denied you because of what you \\nsay; so you can neither avert, nor help. Who\\ufffeever among you commits injustice, We will \\nmake him taste a grievous punishment.\\n20. We never sent any messengers before you, \\nbut they ate food and walked in the market\\ufffeplaces. And We made some of you tempters \\nfor one another—will you be patient? Your \\nLord is always Observing.\\n21. Those who do not expect to meet Us say, \\n“If only the angels were sent down to us, or \\nwe could see our Lord.” They have grown ar\\uffferogant within themselves, and have become \\nexcessively defiant.\\n22. On the Day when they see the angels—\\nthere will be no good news for sinners on that \\nDay; and they will say, “A protective refuge.”\\n23. We will proceed to the works they did, and \\nwill turn them into scattered dust.\\n24. The companions of Paradise on that Day \\nwill be better lodged, and more fairly accom\\ufffemodated.\\n25. The Day when the sky is cleft with clouds, \\nand the angels are sent down in streams.\\n26. On that Day, true sovereignty will belong \\nto the Merciful, and it will be a difficult Day \\nfor the disbelievers.\\n27. On that Day, the wrongdoer will bite his \\nhands, and say, “If only I had followed the \\nway with the Messenger.\\n28. Oh, woe to me; I wish I never took so-and\\ufffeso for a friend.\\n29. He led me away from the Message after it \\nhad come to me; for Satan has always been a \\nbetrayer of man.”\\n30. And the Messenger will say, “My Lord, my \\npeople have abandoned this Quran.”\\n134\\n25. THE CRITERION (al-Furqan)\\n31. Likewise, to every prophet We assign ene\\ufffemies from among the wicked. But your Lord \\nsuffices as a Guide and Savior.\\n32. Those who disbelieve say, “Why was the \\nQuran not revealed to him at once?” Thus in \\norder to strengthen your heart thereby, and \\nWe revealed it in stages.\\n33. Whatever argument they come to you \\nwith, We provide you with the truth, and a \\nbetter exposition.\\n34. Those who are herded into Hell on their \\nfaces—those are in a worse position, and fur\\ufffether astray from the way.\\n35. We gave Moses the Scripture, and ap\\ufffepointed his brother Aaron as his assistant.\\n36. We said, “Go to the people who rejected \\nOur signs,” and We destroyed them com\\ufffepletely.\\n37. And the people of Noah: when they re\\ufffejected the messengers, We drowned them, \\nand made them a lesson for mankind. We \\nhave prepared for the wrongdoers a painful \\nretribution.\\n38. And Aad, and Thamood, and the inhabit\\ufffeants of Arras, and many generations in be\\ufffetween.\\n39. To each We presented the parables; and \\neach We devastated utterly.\\n40. And they came upon the city that was \\ndrenched by the terrible rain. Did they not \\nsee it? But they do not expect resurrection.\\n41. And when they see you, they take you for \\nnothing but mockery: “Is this the one Allah \\nsent as a messenger?”\\n42. “He nearly led us away from our gods, had \\nwe not patiently adhered to them.” But they \\nwill know, when they witness the torment, \\nwho is further away from the way.\\n43. Have you seen him who chose his desire as \\nhis god? Would you be an agent for him?\\n44. Or do you assume that most of them hear \\nor understand? They are just like cattle, but \\neven more errant in their way.\\n45. Do you not see how your Lord extends the \\nshadow? Had He willed, He could have made \\nit still. And We made the sun a pointer to it.\\n46. Then We withdraw it towards Us gradu\\ufffeally.\\n47. And it is He who made the night a covering \\nfor you, and sleep for rest; and He made the \\nday a revival.\\n48. And it is He who sends the winds, bringing \\nadvance news of His mercy; and We send \\ndown from the sky pure water.\\n49. To revive dead lands thereby, and to pro\\ufffevide drink for the multitude of animals and \\nhumans We created.\\n50. We have circulated it among them, that \\nthey may reflect, but most people persist in \\nthanklessness.\\n51. Had We willed, We could have sent to \\nevery town a warner.\\n52. So do not obey the disbelievers, but strive \\nagainst them with it, a mighty struggle.\\n53. And it is He who merged the two seas; this \\none fresh and sweet, and that one salty and \\nbitter; and He placed between them a barrier, \\nand an impassable boundary.\\n54. And it is He who, from fluid, created the \\nhuman being. Then He made relationships \\nthrough marriage and mating. Your Lord is \\nOmnipotent.\\n55. And yet, instead of Allah, they serve what \\nneither profits them nor harms them. The \\ndisbeliever has always turned his back on his \\nLord.\\n56. We sent you only as a herald of good news \\nand a warner. \\n57. Say, “I ask of you no payment for this—\\nonly that whoever wills may take a path to his \\nLord.”\\n58. And put your trust in the Living, the One \\nwho never dies; and celebrate His praise. He \\nsuffices as the All-Informed Knower of the \\nfaults of His creatures.\\n59. He who created the heavens and the earth \\nand everything between them in six days, \\n135\\n26. THE POETS (ash-Shu’ara’)\\nthen settled on the Throne. The Most Merci\\ufffeful. Ask about Him a well-informed.\\n60. And when it is said to them, “Bow down to \\nthe Merciful,” they say, “And what is the \\nMerciful? Are we to bow down to whatever \\nyou command us?” And it increases their \\naversion.\\n61. Blessed is He who placed constellations in \\nthe sky, and placed in it a lamp, and an illu\\ufffeminating moon.\\n62. And it is He who made the night and the \\nday alternate—for whoever desires to reflect, \\nor desires to show gratitude.\\n63. The servants of the Merciful are those who \\nwalk the earth in humility, and when the ig\\ufffenorant address them, they say, “Peace.”\\n64. And those who pass the night prostrating \\nthemselves to their Lord and standing up.\\n65. And those who say, ‘‘Our Lord, avert from \\nus the suffering of Hell, for its suffering is \\ncontinuous.\\n66. It is indeed a miserable residence and des\\ufffetination.”\\n67. And those who, when they spend, are nei\\ufffether wasteful nor stingy, but choose a middle \\ncourse between that.\\n68. And those who do not implore besides Al\\ufffelah any other god, and do not kill the soul \\nwhich Allah has made sacred—except in the \\npursuit of justice—and do not commit adul\\ufffetery. Whoever does that will face penalties.\\n69. The punishment will be doubled for him \\non the Day of Resurrection, and he will dwell \\ntherein in humiliation forever.\\n70. Except for those who repent, and believe, \\nand do good deeds. These—Allah will replace \\ntheir bad deeds with good deeds. Allah is ever \\nForgiving and Merciful.\\n71. Whoever repents and acts righteously—\\nhas inclined towards Allah with repentance.\\n72. And those who do not bear false witness; \\nand when they come across indecencies, they \\npass by with dignity.\\n73. And those who, when reminded of the rev\\ufffeelations of their Lord, do not fall before them \\ndeaf and blind.\\n74. And those who say, “Our Lord, grant us de\\ufffelight in our spouses and our children, and \\nmake us a good example for the righteous.”\\n75. Those will be awarded the Chamber for \\ntheir patience, and will be greeted therein \\nwith greetings and peace.\\n76. Abiding therein forever—it is an excellent \\nresidence and destination.\\n77. Say, “What are you to my Lord without \\nyour prayers? You have denied the truth, and \\nthe inevitable will happen.”\\n26. THE POETS\\n(ash-Shu’ara’)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Ta, Seen, Meem.\\n2. These are the Verses of the Clarifying Book.\\n3. Perhaps you will destroy yourself with grief, \\nbecause they do not become believers.\\n4. If We will, We can send down upon them a \\nsign from heaven, at which their necks will \\nstay bent in humility.\\n5. No fresh reminder comes to them from the \\nMost Merciful, but they turn their backs at it.\\n6. They have denied the truth, but soon will \\ncome to them the news of what they ridi\\ufffeculed.\\n7. Have they not seen the earth, and how \\nmany beautiful pairs We produced therein?\\n8. Surely in this is a sign, but most of them are \\nnot believers.\\n9. Most surely, your Lord is the Almighty, the \\nMerciful.\\n10. Your Lord called to Moses, “Go to the ty\\uffferannical people.\\n11. The people of Pharaoh. Will they not fear?”\\n136\\n26. THE POETS (ash-Shu’ara’)\\n12. He said, “My Lord, I fear they will reject \\nme.\\n13. And I become stressed, and my tongue is \\nnot fluent, so send Aaron too.\\n14. And they have a charge against me, so I fear \\nthey will kill me.”\\n15. He said, “No. Go, both of you, with Our \\nproofs. We will be with you, listening.\\n16. Go to Pharaoh, and say, ‘We are the Mes\\ufffesengers of the Lord of the Worlds.\\n17. Let the Children of Israel go with us.'“\\n18. He said, “Did we not raise you among us as \\na child, and you stayed among us for many of \\nyour years?\\n19. And you committed that deed you com\\ufffemitted, and you were ungrateful.”\\n20. He said, “I did it then, when I was of those \\nastray.\\n21. And I fled from you when I feared you; but \\nmy Lord gave me wisdom, and made me one \\nof the messengers.\\n22. Is that the favor you taunt me with, alt\\ufffehough you have enslaved the Children of Is\\uffferael?”\\n23. Pharaoh said, “And what is the Lord of the \\nWorlds?”\\n24. He said, “The Lord of the heavens and the \\nearth, and everything between them, if you \\nare aware.”\\n25. He said to those around him, “Do you not \\nhear?”\\n26. He said, “Your Lord and the Lord of your \\nancestors of old.”\\n27. He said, “This messenger of yours, who is \\nsent to you, is crazy.”\\n28. He said, “Lord of the East and the West, \\nand everything between them, if you under\\ufffestand.”\\n29. He said, “If you accept any god other than \\nme, I will make you a prisoner.”\\n30. He said, “What if I bring you something \\nconvincing?”\\n31. He said, “Bring it, if you are being truthful.”\\n32. So he cast his staff; and it was a serpent, \\nplain to see.\\n33. And he pulled his hand; and it was white, \\nfor all to see.\\n34. He said to the dignitaries around him, \\n“This is a skilled magician.\\n35. He intends to drive you out of your land \\nwith his magic, so what do you recommend?”\\n36. They said, “Delay him and his brother, and \\nsend recruiters to the cities.\\n37. To bring you every experienced magician.”\\n38. So the magicians were gathered for the ap\\ufffepointment on a specified day.\\n39. And it was said to the people, “Are you all \\ngathered?\\n40. That we may follow the magicians, if they \\nare the winners.”\\n41. When the magicians arrived, they said to \\nPharaoh, “Is there a reward for us, if we are \\nthe winners?”\\n42. He said, “Yes, and you will be among those \\nfavored.”\\n43. Moses said to them, “Present what you in\\ufffetend to present.”\\n44. So they threw their ropes and their sticks, \\nand said, “By the majesty of Pharaoh, we will \\nbe the winners.”\\n45. Then Moses threw his staff, and behold, it \\nbegan swallowing their trickery.\\n46. And the magicians fell down prostrating.\\n47. They said, “We have believed in the Lord \\nof the Worlds.\\n48. The Lord of Moses and Aaron.”\\n49. He said, “Did you believe in Him before I \\nhave given you permission? He must be your \\nchief, who taught you magic. You will soon \\nknow. I will cut off your hands and feet on \\nopposite sides, and I will crucify you all.”\\n50. They said, “No problem. To our Lord we \\nwill return.\\n137\\n26. THE POETS (ash-Shu’ara’)\\n51. We are eager for our Lord to forgive us our \\nsins, since we are the first of the believers.”\\n52. And We inspired Moses: “Travel with My \\nservants by night. You will be followed.”\\n53. Pharaoh sent heralds to the cities.\\n54. “These are a small gang.\\n55. And they are enraging us.\\n56. But we are a vigilant multitude.”\\n57. So We drove them out of gardens and \\nsprings.\\n58. And treasures and noble dwellings.\\n59. So it was. And We made the Children of \\nIsrael inherit them.\\n60. And they pursued them at sunrise.\\n61. When the two groups sighted each other, \\nthe followers of Moses said, “We are being \\novertaken.”\\n62. He said, “No; my Lord is with me, He will \\nguide me.”\\n63. We inspired Moses: “Strike the sea with \\nyour staff.” Whereupon it parted, and each \\npart was like a huge hill.\\n64. And there We brought the others near.\\n65. And We saved Moses and those with him, \\nall together.\\n66. Then We drowned the others.\\n67. In that there is a sign, but most of them are \\nnot believers.\\n68. Surely, your Lord is the Almighty, the Mer\\ufffeciful.\\n69. And relate to them the story of Abraham.\\n70. When he said to his father and his people, \\n“What do you worship?”\\n71. They said, “We worship idols, and we re\\ufffemain devoted to them.”\\n72. He said, “Do they hear you when you pray?\\n73. Or do they benefit you, or harm you?”\\n74. They said, “But we found our ancestors do\\ufffeing so.” \\n75. He said, “Have you considered what you \\nworship.\\n76. You and your ancient ancestors?\\n77. They are enemies to me, but not so the \\nLord of the Worlds.\\n78. He who created me, and guides me.\\n79. He who feeds me, and waters me.\\n80. And when I get sick, He heals me.\\n81. He who makes me die, and then revives me.\\n82. He who, I hope, will forgive my sins on the \\nDay of the Reckoning.”\\n83. “My Lord! Grant me wisdom, and include \\nme with the righteous.\\n84. And give me a reputation of truth among \\nthe others.\\n85. And make me of the inheritors of the Gar\\ufffeden of Bliss.\\n86. And forgive my father—he was one of the \\nmisguided.\\n87. And do not disgrace me on the Day they \\nare resurrected.\\n88. The Day when neither wealth nor children \\nwill help.\\n89. Except for him who comes to Allah with a \\nsound heart.”\\n90. And Paradise will be brought near for the \\nrighteous.\\n91. And the Blaze will be displayed to the devi\\ufffeators.\\n92. And it will be said to them, “Where are \\nthose you used to worship?”\\n93. Besides Allah? Can they help you, or help \\nthemselves?”\\n94. Then they will be toppled into it, together \\nwith the seducers.\\n95. And the soldiers of Satan, all of them. \\n96. They will say, as they feud in it.\\n97. “By Allah, We were in evident error.\\n98. For equating you with the Lord of the \\nWorlds.\\n138\\n26. THE POETS (ash-Shu’ara’)\\n99. No one misled us except the sinners.\\n100. Now we have no intercessors.\\n101. And no sincere friend.\\n102. If only we could have another chance, we \\nwould be among the faithful.”\\n103. Surely in this is a sign, but most of them \\nare not believers.\\n104. Your Lord is the Almighty, the Merciful.\\n105. The people of Noah disbelieved the mes\\ufffesengers.\\n106. Their brother Noah said to them, “Do you \\nnot fear?\\n107. I am to you a faithful messenger.\\n108. So fear Allah, and obey me.\\n109. I ask of you no payment for this. My pay\\ufffement is only from the Lord of the Worlds.\\n110. So fear Allah, and obey me.”\\n111. They said, “Shall we believe in you, when \\nit is the lowliest who follow you?”\\n112. He said, “What do I know about what they \\ndo?\\n113. Their account rests only with my Lord, if \\nyou have sense.\\n114. And I am not about to drive away the be\\ufffelievers.\\n115. I am only a clear warner.”\\n116. They said, “If you do not refrain, O Noah, \\nyou will be stoned.”\\n117. He said, “My Lord, my people have denied \\nme.\\n118. So judge between me and them decisively, \\nand deliver me and the believers who are with \\nme.\\n119. So We delivered him and those with him \\nin the laden Ark.\\n120. Then We drowned the rest.\\n121. In that is a sign, but most of them are not \\nbelievers.\\n122. Your Lord is the Almighty, the Merciful.\\n123. Aad disbelieved the messengers.\\n124. When their brother Hud said to them, “Do \\nyou not fear?\\n125. I am to you a faithful messenger.\\n126. So fear Allah, and obey me.\\n127. I ask of you no payment for this. My pay\\ufffement is only from the Lord of the Worlds.\\n128. Do you build a monument on every height \\nfor vanity's sake?\\n129. And you set up fortresses, hoping to live \\nforever?\\n130. And when you strike, you strike merci\\ufffelessly?\\n131. So fear Allah, and obey me.\\n132. And reverence Him, who supplied you \\nwith everything you know. \\n133. He supplied you with livestock and chil\\ufffedren.\\n134. And gardens and springs.\\n135. I fear for you the punishment of an awe\\ufffesome Day.”\\n136. They said, “It is the same for us, whether \\nyou lecture us, or do not lecture.\\n137. This is nothing but morals of the ancients.\\n138. And we will not be punished.”\\n139. So they denied him, and We destroyed \\nthem. Surely in this is a sign, but most of \\nthem are not believers.\\n140. Your Lord is the Almighty, the Merciful.\\n141. Thamood disbelieved the messengers.\\n142. When their brother Saleh said to them, \\n“Do you not fear?\\n143. I am to you a faithful messenger.\\n144. So fear Allah, and obey me.\\n145. I ask of you no payment for it. My pay\\ufffement is only from the Lord of the Worlds.\\n146. Will you be left secure in what is here?\\n147. In gardens and springs?\\n148. And fields, and palm-trees whose fruits \\nare delicious?\\n139\\n26. THE POETS (ash-Shu’ara’)\\n149. And you skillfully carve houses in the \\nmountains?\\n150. So fear Allah, and obey me.\\n151. And do not obey the command of the ex\\ufffetravagant.\\n152. Who spread turmoil on earth, and do not \\nreform.”\\n153. They said, “You are surely one of the be\\ufffewitched.\\n154. You are nothing but a man like us. So \\nbring us a sign, if you are truthful.\\n155. He said, “This is a she-camel; she has her \\nturn of drinking, and you have your turn of \\ndrinking—on a specified day.\\n156. And do not touch her with harm, lest the \\npunishment of a great day seizes you.”\\n157. But they slaughtered her, and became full \\nof remorse.\\n158. So the punishment overtook them. Surely \\nin this is a sign, but most of them are not be\\ufffelievers.\\n159. Your Lord is the Almighty, the Merciful.\\n160. The people of Lot disbelieved the messen\\ufffegers.\\n161. When their brother Lot said to them, “Do \\nyou not fear?\\n162. I am to you a faithful messenger.\\n163. So fear Allah, and obey me.\\n164. I ask of you no payment for it. My pay\\ufffement is only from the Lord of the Worlds.\\n165. Do you approach the males of the world?\\n166. And forsake the wives your Lord created \\nfor you? Indeed, you are intrusive people.”\\n167. They said, “Unless you refrain, O Lot, you \\nwill be expelled.”\\n168. He said, “I certainly deplore your con\\ufffeduct.”\\n169. “My Lord, save me and my family from \\nwhat they do.”\\n170. So We saved him and his family, alto\\ufffegether.\\n171. Except for an old woman among those \\nwho tarried.\\n172. Then We destroyed the others.\\n173. And We rained down on them a rain. \\nDreadful is the rain of those forewarned.\\n174. Surely in this is a sign, but most of them \\nare not believers.\\n175. Your Lord is the Almighty, the Merciful.\\n176. The People of the Woods disbelieved the \\nmessengers.\\n177. When Shuaib said to them, “Do you not \\nfear?\\n178. I am to you a trustworthy messenger.\\n179. So fear Allah, and obey me.\\n180. I ask of you no payment for it. My pay\\ufffement is only from the Lord of the Worlds.\\n181. Give full measure, and do not cheat.\\n182. And weigh with accurate scales.\\n183. And do not defraud people of their be\\ufffelongings, and do not work corruption in the \\nland.\\n184. And fear Him who created you and the \\nmasses of old.”\\n185. They said, “You are one of those be\\ufffewitched.\\n186. And you are nothing but a man like us; \\nand we think that you are a liar.\\n187. So bring down on us pieces from the sky, \\nif you are truthful.”\\n188. He said, “My Lord is Well Aware of what \\nyou do.”\\n189. But they denied him. So the punishment \\nof the day of gloom gripped them. It was the \\npunishment of a great day.\\n190. Surely in this is a sign, but most of them \\nare not believers.\\n191. Your Lord is the Almighty, the Merciful.\\n192. It is a revelation from the Lord of the \\nWorlds.\\n193. The Honest Spirit came down with it.\\n140\\n27. THE ANT (an-Naml)\\n194. Upon your heart, that you may be one of \\nthe warners.\\n195. In a clear Arabic tongue.\\n196. And it is in the scriptures of the ancients.\\n197. Is it not a sign for them that the scholars \\nof the Children of Israel recognized it?\\n198. Had We revealed it to one of the foreign\\ufffeers.\\n199. And he had recited it to them, they still \\nwould not have believed in it.\\n200. Thus We make it pass through the hearts \\nof the guilty.\\n201. They will not believe in it until they wit\\ufffeness the painful punishment.\\n202. It will come to them suddenly, while they \\nare unaware.\\n203. Then they will say, “Are we given any res\\ufffepite?”\\n204. Do they seek to hasten Our punishment?\\n205. Have you considered: if We let them enjoy \\nthemselves for some years.\\n206. Then there comes to them what they were \\npromised.\\n207. Of what avail to them will be their past en\\ufffejoyments? \\n208. Never did We destroy a town, but it had \\nwarners.\\n209. As a reminder—We are never unjust.\\n210. It was not the devils that revealed it.\\n211. It is not in their interests, nor in their \\npower.\\n212. They are barred from hearing.\\n213. So do not pray to another god with Allah, \\nelse you will be of those tormented.\\n214. And warn your close relatives.\\n215. And lower your wing to those of the be\\ufffelievers who follow you.\\n216. And if they disobey you, say, “I am inno\\ufffecent of what you do.”\\n217. And put your trust in the Almighty, the \\nMerciful.\\n218. He Who sees you when you rise.\\n219. And your devotions amidst the wor\\ufffeshipers.\\n220. He is indeed the Hearer, the Aware.\\n221. Shall I inform you upon whom the devils \\ndescend?\\n222. They descend upon every sinful liar.\\n223. They give ear, and most of them are liars.\\n224. And as for the poets—the deviators follow \\nthem.\\n225. Do you not see how they ramble in every \\nstyle?\\n226. And how they say what they do not do?\\n227. Except for those who believe, and do good \\ndeeds, and remember Allah frequently, and \\ndefend themselves after they are wronged. As \\nfor those who do wrong, they will know by \\nwhat overturning they will be overturned.\\n27. THE ANT\\n(an-Naml)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Ta, Seen. These are the Signs of the Quran—\\na book that makes things clear.\\n2. Guidance and good news for the believers.\\n3. Those who observe the prayers, and give \\ncharity regularly, and are certain of the Here\\ufffeafter.\\n4. As for those who do not believe in the Here\\ufffeafter: We made their deeds appear good to \\nthem, so they wander aimlessly.\\n5. It is they who will receive the grievous pun\\ufffeishment—and in the Hereafter they will be \\nthe greatest losers.\\n6. You are receiving the Quran from an All\\ufffeWise, All-Knowing.\\n7. When Moses said to his family, “I have \\nglimpsed a fire. I will bring you some news \\nfrom it; or bring you a firebrand, that you \\nmay warm yourselves.”\\n141\\n27. THE ANT (an-Naml)\\n8. Then, when he reached it, he was called: \\n“Blessed is He who is within the fire, and He \\nwho is around it, and glorified be Allah, Lord \\nof the Worlds.\\n9. O Moses, it is I, Allah, the Almighty, the \\nWise.\\n10. Throw down your staff.” But when he saw \\nit quivering, as though it were a demon, he \\nturned around not looking back. “O Moses, \\ndo not fear; the messengers do not fear in My \\npresence.\\n11. But whoever has done wrong, and then \\nsubstituted goodness in place of evil. I am \\nForgiving and Merciful.\\n12. Put your hand inside your pocket, and it \\nwill come out white, without blemish—\\namong nine miracles to Pharaoh and his peo\\ufffeple, for they are immoral people.”\\n13. Yet when Our enlightening signs came to \\nthem, they said, “This is obvious witchcraft.”\\n14. And they rejected them, although their \\nsouls were certain of them, out of wickedness \\nand pride. So see how the outcome was for \\nthe mischief-makers.\\n15. And We gave David and Solomon \\nknowledge. They said, “Praise Allah, who has \\nfavored us over many of His believing serv\\ufffeants.”\\n16. And Solomon succeeded David. He said, \\n“O people, we were taught the language of \\nbirds, and we were given from everything. \\nThis is indeed a real blessing.”\\n17. To the service of Solomon were mobilized \\nhis troops of sprites, and men, and birds—all \\nheld in strict order.\\n18. Until, when they came upon the Valley of \\nAnts, an ant said, “O ants! Go into your nests, \\nlest Solomon and his troops crush you with\\ufffeout noticing.”\\n19. He smiled and laughed at her words, and \\nsaid, “My Lord, direct me to be thankful for \\nthe blessings you have bestowed upon me \\nand upon my parents, and to do good works \\nthat please You. And admit me, by Your \\ngrace, into the company of Your virtuous \\nservants.”\\n20. Then he inspected the birds, and said, \\n“Why do I not see the hoopoe? Or is he \\namong the absentees?\\n21. I will punish him most severely, or slay \\nhim, unless he gives me a valid excuse.”\\n22. But he did not stay for long. He said, “I \\nhave learnt something you did not know. I \\nhave come to you from Sheba, with reliable \\ninformation.\\n23. I found a woman ruling over them, and she \\nwas given of everything, and she has a mag\\ufffenificent throne.\\n24. I found her and her people worshiping the \\nsun, instead of Allah. Satan made their con\\ufffeduct appear good to them, and diverted them \\nfrom the path, so they are not guided.\\n25. If only they would worship Allah, who \\nbrings to light the mysteries of the heavens \\nand the earth, and knows what you conceal \\nand what you reveal.\\n26. Allah—There is no god but He, the Lord \\nof the Sublime Throne.”\\n27. He said, “We will see, whether you have \\nspoken the truth, or whether you are a liar.\\n28. Go with this letter of mine, and deliver it to \\nthem; then withdraw from them, and see how \\nthey respond.”\\n29. She said, “O Counselors, a gracious letter \\nwas delivered to me.\\n30. It is from Solomon, and it is, ‘In the Name \\nof Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful.\\n31. Do not defy me, and come to me submis\\ufffesively.’”\\n32. She said, “O counselors, advise me in this \\nmatter of mine. I never make a decision un\\ufffeless you are present.”\\n33. They said, “We are a people of might and \\ngreat courage, but the decision is yours, so \\nconsider what you wish to command.”\\n34. She said, “When kings enter a city, they \\ndevastate it, and subjugate its dignified peo\\ufffeple. Thus they always do.\\n142\\n27. THE ANT (an-Naml)\\n35. I am sending them a gift, and will see what \\nthe envoys bring back.”\\n36. When he came to Solomon, he said, “Are \\nyou supplying me with money? What Allah \\nhas given me is better than what He has given \\nyou. It is you who delight in your gift.\\n37. Go back to them. We will come upon them \\nwith troops they cannot resist; and we will ex\\ufffepel them from there, disgraced and humili\\ufffeated.”\\n38. He said, “O notables, which one of you will \\nbring me her throne before they come to me \\nin submission?”\\n39. An imp of the sprites said, “I will bring it to \\nyou before you rise from your seat. I am \\nstrong and reliable enough to do it.”\\n40. He who had knowledge from the Book \\nsaid, “I will bring it to you before your glance \\nreturns to you.” And when he saw it settled \\nbefore him, he said, “This is from the grace of \\nmy Lord, to test me, whether I am grateful or \\nungrateful. He who is grateful, his gratitude \\nis to his own credit; but he who is ungrate\\ufffeful—my Lord is Independent and Generous.”\\n41. He said, “Disguise her throne for her, and \\nwe shall see whether she will be guided, or re\\ufffemains one of the misguided.”\\n42. When she arrived, it was said, “Is your \\nthrone like this?” She said, “As if this is it.” \\n“We were given knowledge before her, and \\nwe were submissive.”\\n43. But she was prevented by what she wor\\ufffeshiped besides Allah; she belonged to a disbe\\ufffelieving people.\\n44. It was said to her, “Go inside the palace.” \\nAnd when she saw it, she thought it was a \\ndeep pond, and she bared her legs. He said, \\n“It is a palace paved with glass.” She said, “My \\nLord, I have done wrong to myself, and I have \\nsubmitted with Solomon, to Allah, Lord of \\nthe Worlds.”\\n45. And We sent to Thamood their brother \\nSaleh: “Worship Allah.” But they became two \\ndisputing factions.\\n46. He said, “O my people, why are you quick \\nto do evil rather than good? If only you would \\nseek Allah’s forgiveness, so that you may be \\nshown mercy.”\\n47. They said, “We consider you an ill omen, \\nand those with you.” He said, “Your omen is \\nwith Allah. In fact, you are a people being \\ntested.”\\n48. In the city was a gang of nine who made \\nmischief in the land and did no good.\\n49. They said, “Swear by Allah to one another \\nthat we will attack him and his family by \\nnight, and then tell his guardian, 'We did not \\nwitness the murder of his family, and we are \\nbeing truthful.'“\\n50. They planned a plan, and We planned a \\nplan, but they did not notice.\\n51. So note the outcome of their planning; We \\ndestroyed them and their people, altogether.\\n52. Here are their homes, in ruins, on account \\nof their iniquities. Surely in this is a sign for \\npeople who know.\\n53. And We saved those who believed and \\nwere pious.\\n54. And Lot, when he said to his people, “Do \\nyou commit lewdness with open eyes?\\n55. Do you lust after men instead of women? \\nYou are truly ignorant people.”\\n56. But the only response of his people was to \\nsay, “Expel the family of Lot from your town. \\nThey are purist people.”\\n57. So We saved him and his family, except for \\nhis wife, whom We destined to be among the \\nlaggards.\\n58. And We rained upon them a rain. Misera\\ufffeble was the rain of those forewarned.\\n59. Say, “Praise Allah, and peace be upon His \\nservants whom He has selected. Is Allah bet\\ufffeter, or what they associate?”\\n60. Or, who created the heavens and the earth, \\nand rains down water from the sky for you? \\nWith it We produce gardens full of beauty, \\nwhose trees you could not have produced. Is \\n143\\n27. THE ANT (an-Naml)\\nthere another god with Allah? But they are a \\npeople who equate.\\n61. Or, who made the earth habitable, and \\nmade rivers flow through it, and set moun\\ufffetains on it, and placed a partition between the \\ntwo seas? Is there another god with Allah? \\nBut most of them do not know.\\n62. Or, who answers the one in need when he \\nprays to Him, and relieves adversity, and \\nmakes you successors on earth? Is there an\\ufffeother god with Allah? How hardly you pay at\\ufffetention.\\n63. Or, who guides you through the darkness \\nof land and sea, and who sends the winds as \\nheralds of His mercy? Is there another god \\nwith Allah? Most exalted is Allah, above what \\nthey associate.\\n64. Or, who originates the creation and then \\nrepeats it, and who gives you livelihood from \\nthe sky and the earth? Is there another god \\nwith Allah? Say, “Produce your evidence, if \\nyou are truthful.”\\n65. Say, “No one in the heavens or on earth \\nknows the future except Allah; and they do \\nnot perceive when they will be resurrected.”\\n66. In fact, their knowledge of the Hereafter is \\nconfused. In fact, they are in doubt about it. \\nIn fact, they are blind to it.\\n67. Those who disbelieve say, “When we have \\nbecome dust, and our ancestors, shall we be \\nbrought out?\\n68. We were promised that before, we and our \\nancestors—these are nothing but legends of \\nthe ancients.”\\n69. Say, travel through the earth, and observe \\nthe fate of the guilty.”\\n70. But do not grieve over them, and do not be \\ntroubled by what they plot.\\n71. And they say, “When is this promise, if you \\nare truthful?”\\n72. Say, “Perhaps some of what you are impa\\ufffetient for has drawn near.”\\n73. Your Lord is gracious towards humanity, \\nbut most of them are not thankful.\\n74. And your Lord knows what their hearts \\nconceal, and what they reveal.\\n75. There is no mystery in the heaven and the \\nearth, but it is in a Clear Book.\\n76. This Quran relates to the Children of Israel \\nmost of what they differ about.\\n77. And it is guidance and mercy for the be\\ufffelievers.\\n78. Your Lord will judge between them by His \\nwisdom. He is the Almighty, the All-Know\\ufffeing.\\n79. So rely on Allah. You are upon the clear \\ntruth.\\n80. You cannot make the dead hear, nor can \\nyou make the deaf hear the call if they turn \\ntheir backs and flee.\\n81. Nor can you guide the blind out of their \\nstraying. You can make no one listen, except \\nthose who believe in Our verses; for they are \\nMuslims.\\n82. And when the Word has fallen on them, \\nWe will bring out for them from the earth a \\ncreature which will say to them that the peo\\ufffeple are uncertain of Our revelations.\\n83. On the Day when We gather from every \\ncommunity a group of those who rejected \\nOur revelations; and they will be restrained.\\n84. Until, when they arrive, He will say, “Did \\nyou reject My revelations without compre\\ufffehending them? Or what is it you were doing?”\\n85. The Word will come down upon them for \\ntheir wrongdoing, and they will not speak.\\n86. Do they not see that We made the night for \\nthem to rest therein, and the day for visibil\\ufffeity? Surely in that are signs for people who \\nbelieve.\\n87. On the Day when the Trumpet is blown, \\neveryone in the heavens and the earth will be \\nhorrified, except whomever Allah wills; and \\neveryone will come before Him in humility.\\n88. And you see the mountains, and imagine \\nthem fixed, yet they pass, as the passing of the \\n144\\n28. HISTORY (al-Qasas)\\nclouds—the making of Allah, who has per\\ufffefected everything. He is fully Informed of \\nwhat you do.\\n89. Whoever brings a virtue will receive better \\nthan it—and they will be safe from the hor\\uffferors of that Day.\\n90. But whoever brings evil—their faces will be \\ntumbled into the Fire. Will you be rewarded \\nexcept for what you used to do?\\n91. “I was commanded to worship the Lord of \\nthis town, who has sanctified it, and to \\nWhom everything belongs; and I was com\\ufffemanded to be of those who submit.\\n92. And to recite the Quran.” Whoever is \\nguided—is guided to his own advantage. And \\nwhoever goes astray, then say, “I am one of \\nthe warners.”\\n93. And say, “Praise belongs to Allah; He will \\nshow you His signs, and you will recognize \\nthem. Your Lord is not heedless of what you \\ndo.”\\n28. HISTORY\\n(al-Qasas)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Ta, Seen, Meem.\\n2. These are the Verses of the Clear Book.\\n3. We narrate to you from the history of Mo\\ufffeses and Pharaoh—in truth—for people who \\nbelieve.\\n4. Pharaoh exalted himself in the land, and di\\ufffevided its people into factions. He persecuted \\na group of them, slaughtering their sons, \\nwhile sparing their daughters. He was truly a \\ncorrupter.\\n5. But We desired to favor those who were op\\ufffepressed in the land, and to make them lead\\ufffeers, and to make them the inheritors.\\n6. And to establish them in the land; and to \\nshow Pharaoh, Hamaan, and their troops, the \\nvery thing they feared.\\n7. We inspired the mother of Moses: “Nurse \\nhim; then, when you fear for him, cast him \\ninto the river, and do not fear, nor grieve; We \\nwill return him to you, and make him one of \\nthe messengers.”\\n8. Pharaoh’s household picked him up, to be \\nan opponent and a sorrow for them. Pharaoh, \\nHamaan, and their troops were sinners.\\n9. Pharaoh’s wife said, “An eye's delight for me \\nand for you. Do not kill him; perhaps he will \\nbe useful to us, or we may adopt him as a \\nson.” But they did not foresee.\\n10. The heart of Moses’ mother became vacant. \\nShe was about to disclose him, had We not \\nsteadied her heart, that she may remain a be\\ufffeliever.\\n11. She said to his sister, “Trail him.” So she \\nwatched him from afar, and they were una\\ufffeware.\\n12. We forbade him breastfeeding at first. So \\nshe said, “Shall I tell you about a family that \\ncan raise him for you, and will look after \\nhim?”\\n13. Thus We returned him to his mother, that \\nshe may be comforted, and not grieve, and \\nknow that Allah’s promise is true. But most \\nof them do not know.\\n14. And when he reached his maturity, and be\\ufffecame established, We gave him wisdom and \\nknowledge. Thus do We reward the virtuous.\\n15. Once he entered the city, unnoticed by its \\npeople. He found in it two men fighting—one \\nof his own sect, and one from his enemies. \\nThe one of his sect solicited his assistance \\nagainst the one from his enemies; so Moses \\npunched him, and put an end to him. He said, \\n“This is of Satan's doing; he is an enemy that \\nopenly misleads.”\\n16. He said, “My Lord, I have wronged myself, \\nso forgive me.” So He forgave him. He is the \\nForgiver, the Merciful.\\n17. He said, “My Lord, in as much as you have \\nfavored me, I will never be a supporter of the \\ncriminals.”\\n145\\n28. HISTORY (al-Qasas)\\n18. The next morning, he went about in the \\ncity, fearful and vigilant, when the man who \\nhad sought his assistance the day before was \\nshouting out to him. Moses said to him, “You \\nare clearly a troublemaker.”\\n19. As he was about to strike the one who was \\ntheir enemy, he said, “O Moses, do you in\\ufffetend to kill me, as you killed someone yester\\ufffeday? You only want to be a bully in the land, \\nand do not want to be a peacemaker.”\\n20. And a man came from the farthest part of \\nthe city running. He said, “O Moses, the au\\ufffethorities are considering killing you, so leave; \\nI am giving you good advice.”\\n21. So he left, fearful and vigilant. He said, “My \\nLord, deliver me from the wrongdoing peo\\ufffeple.”\\n22. As he headed towards Median, he said, \\n“Perhaps my Lord will guide me to the right \\nway.”\\n23. And when he arrived at the waters of Me\\ufffedian, he found there a crowd of people draw\\ufffeing water, and he noticed two women waiting \\non the side. He said, “What is the matter with \\nyou?” They said, “We cannot draw water un\\ufffetil the shepherds depart, and our father is a \\nvery old man.”\\n24. So he drew water for them, and then with\\ufffedrew to the shade, and said, “My Lord, I am \\nin dire need of whatever good you might send \\ndown to me.”\\n25. Then, one of the two women approached \\nhim, walking bashfully. She said, “My father \\nis calling you, to reward you for drawing wa\\ufffeter for us.” And when he came to him, and \\ntold him the story, he said, “Do not fear, you \\nhave escaped from the wrongdoing people.”\\n26. One of the two women said, “Father, hire \\nhim; the best employee for you is the strong \\nand trustworthy.”\\n27. He said, “I want to marry you to one of \\nthese two daughters of mine, provided you \\nwork for me for eight years. But if you com\\ufffeplete ten, that is up to you. I do not intend to \\nimpose any hardship on you. You will find \\nme, Allah willing, one of the righteous.”\\n28. He said, “Let this be an agreement between \\nyou and me. Whichever of the two terms I \\nfulfill, there shall be no reprisal against me; \\nand Allah is witness over what we say.”\\n29. When Moses had completed the term, and \\ndeparted with his family, he noticed a fire by \\nthe side of the Mount. He said to his family, \\n“Stay here, I have glimpsed a fire. Perhaps I \\ncan bring you some information from there, \\nor an ember from the fire, that you may warm \\nyourselves.”\\n30. When he reached it, he was called from the \\nright side of the valley, at the Blessed Spot, \\nfrom the bush: “O Moses, it is I, Allah, the \\nLord of the Worlds.\\n31. Throw down your staff.” And when he saw \\nit wiggling, as if it were possessed, he turned \\nhis back to flee, and did not look back. “O \\nMoses, come forward, and do not fear, you \\nare perfectly safe.\\n32. Put your hand inside your pocket, and it \\nwill come out white, without blemish. And \\npress your arm to your side, against fear. \\nThese are two proofs from your Lord, to \\nPharaoh and his dignitaries. They are truly \\nsinful people.”\\n33. He said, “My Lord, I have killed one of \\nthem, and I fear they will kill me.\\n34. And my brother Aaron, he is more elo\\ufffequent than me, so send him with me, to help \\nme, and to confirm my words, for I fear they \\nwill reject me.”\\n35. He said, “We will strengthen your arm with \\nyour brother, and We will give you authority, \\nso they will not touch you. By virtue of Our \\nsigns, you and those who follow you will be \\nthe triumphant.”\\n36. But when Moses came to them with Our \\nsigns, clear and manifest, they said, “This is \\nnothing but fabricated magic, and We never \\nheard of this from our ancestors of old.”\\n37. Moses said, “My Lord is well aware of him \\nwho brings guidance from Him, and him \\nwho will have the sequel of the abode. The \\nwrongdoers will not succeed.”\\n146\\n28. HISTORY (al-Qasas)\\n38. Pharaoh said, “O nobles, I know of no god \\nfor you other than me. So fire-up the bricks \\nfor me O Hamaan, and build me a tower, that \\nI may ascend to the God of Moses, though I \\nthink he is a liar.”\\n39. He and his troops acted arrogantly in the \\nland, with no justification. They thought they \\nwould not be returned to Us.\\n40. So We seized him, and his troops, and We \\nthrew them into the sea. Observe, therefore, \\nwhat was the end of the oppressors.\\n41. And We made them leaders calling to the \\nFire. And on Resurrection Day, they will not \\nbe saved.\\n42. And We pursued them in this world with a \\ncurse. And on Resurrection Day, they will be \\namong the despised.\\n43. We gave Moses the Scripture after We had \\nannihilated the previous generations; as an il\\ufffelumination for mankind, and guidance, and \\nmercy, so that they may remember.\\n44. You were not on the Western Side when \\nWe decreed the command to Moses, nor \\nwere you among the witnesses.\\n45. But We established many generations, and \\ntime took its toll on them. Nor were you \\namong the people of Median, reciting Our \\nrevelations to them. But We kept sending \\nmessengers.\\n46. Nor were you by the side of the Mount \\nwhen We proclaimed. Rather, it was a mercy \\nfrom your Lord, that you may warn people \\nwho received no warner before you, so that \\nthey may take heed.\\n47. Otherwise, if a calamity befell them as a re\\ufffesult of what their hands have perpetrated, \\nthey would say, “Our Lord, if only You had \\nsent us a messenger, we would have followed \\nYour revelations, and been among the believ\\ufffeers.”\\n48. But when the truth came to them from Us, \\nthey said, “If only he was given the like of \\nwhat was given to Moses.” Did they not dis\\ufffebelieve in what was given to Moses in the \\npast? They said, “Two works of magic back\\ufffeing one another.” And they said, “We are dis\\ufffebelieving in both.”\\n49. Say, “Then bring a scripture from Allah, \\nmore conductive to guidance than both, and \\nI will follow it, if you are truthful.”\\n50. But if they fail to respond to you, know that \\nthey follow their fancies. And who is more \\nlost than him who follows his fancy without \\nguidance from Allah? Allah does not guide \\nthe unjust people.\\n51. We have delivered the Word to them, that \\nthey may remember.\\n52. Those to whom We gave the Scripture be\\ufffefore it believe in it.\\n53. When it is recited to them, they say, “We \\nhave believed in it; it is the truth from our \\nLord; we were Muslims prior to it.”\\n54. These will be given their reward twice, be\\ufffecause they persevered; and they counter evil \\nwith good; and from Our provisions to them, \\nthey give.\\n55. And when they hear vain talk, they avoid \\nit, and say, “We have our deeds, and you have \\nyour deeds; peace be upon you; we do not de\\ufffesire the ignorant.”\\n56. You cannot guide whom you love, but Al\\ufffelah guides whom He wills, and He knows best \\nthose who are guided.\\n57. And they say, “If we follow the guidance \\nwith you, we will be snatched from our land.” \\nDid We not establish for them a Safe Sanctu\\ufffeary, to which are brought all kinds of fruits, \\nas provision from Ourselves? But most of \\nthem do not know.\\n58. And how many a city did We destroy for \\nturning unappreciative of its livelihood? Here \\nare their homes, uninhabited after them, ex\\ufffecept for a few. And We became the Inheri\\ufffetors.\\n59. Your Lord never destroys cities without \\nfirst sending a messenger in their midst, re\\ufffeciting to them Our revelations. And We \\nnever destroy the cities, unless their people \\nare wrongdoers.\\n147\\n28. HISTORY (al-Qasas)\\n60. Whatever thing you are given is but the \\nmaterial of this world, and its glitter. But \\nwhat is with Allah is better, and longer last\\ufffeing. Do you not comprehend?\\n61. Can someone to whom We have made a \\nfine promise—which he will attain—be equal \\nto someone to whom We have given enjoy\\ufffements in this world, but who will be, on Res\\ufffeurrection Day, among the arraigned?\\n62. On the Day when He will call to them, and \\nsay, “Where are My associates whom you \\nused to claim?”\\n63. Those against whom the sentence is justi\\ufffefied will say, “Our Lord, these are they whom \\nwe misled. We misled them, as we were mis\\ufffeled. We beg Your forgiveness; it was not us \\nthey used to worship.”\\n64. And it will be said, “Call on your partners.” \\nAnd they will call on them, but they will not \\nrespond to them. And they will see the suffer\\ufffeing. If only they were guided.\\n65. On the Day when He will call to them, and \\nsay, “What did you answer the Messengers?”\\n66. They will be blinded by the facts on that \\nDay, and they will not question each other.\\n67. But he who repents, and believes, and does \\nrighteous deeds, may well be among the win\\ufffeners.\\n68. Your Lord creates whatever He wills, and \\nHe chooses. The choice is not theirs. Glory be \\nto Allah, and exalted be He above the associ\\ufffeations they make.\\n69. And your Lord knows what their hearts \\nconceal, and what they reveal.\\n70. And He is Allah. There is no god but He. \\nTo Him belongs all praise in this life, and in \\nthe next. And His is the decision, and to Him \\nyou will be returned.\\n71. Say, “Have you considered? Had Allah \\nmade the night perpetual over you until the \\nDay of Resurrection, which god other than \\nAllah will bring you illumination? Do you \\nnot hear?”\\n72. Say, “Have you considered? Had Allah \\nmade the day perpetual over you until the \\nDay of Resurrection, which god other than \\nAllah will bring you night to rest in? Do you \\nnot see?”\\n73. It is out of His mercy that He made for you \\nthe night and the day, that you may rest in it, \\nand seek some of His bounty; and that you \\nmay give thanks.\\n74. On the Day when He will call to them, and \\nsay, “Where are My associates whom you \\nused to claim?”\\n75. And We will draw out from every commu\\ufffenity a witness, and say, “Produce your evi\\ufffedence.” Then they will realize that the truth is \\nAllah’s, and those they used to invent have \\nforsaken them.\\n76. Quaroon belonged to the clan of Moses, \\nbut he oppressed them. We had given him \\ntreasures, the keys of which would weigh \\ndown a group of strong men. His people said \\nto him, “Do not exult; Allah does not love the \\nexultant.\\n77. But seek, with what Allah has given you, \\nthe Home of the Hereafter, and do not ne\\ufffeglect your share of this world. And be chari\\ufffetable, as Allah has been charitable to you. \\nAnd do not seek corruption in the land. Allah \\ndoes not like the seekers of corruption.”\\n78. He said, “I was given all this on account of \\nknowledge I possess.” Did he not know that \\nAllah destroyed many generations before \\nhim, who were stronger than he, and pos\\ufffesessed greater riches? But the guilty will not \\nbe asked about their sins.\\n79. And he went out before his people in his \\nsplendor. Those who desired the worldly life \\nsaid, “If only we possessed the likes of what \\nQuaroon was given. He is indeed very fortu\\ufffenate.”\\n80. But those who were given knowledge said, \\n“Woe to you! The reward of Allah is better for \\nthose who believe and do righteous deeds.” \\nYet none attains it except the steadfast.\\n81. So We caused the earth to cave in on him\\nand his mansion. He had no company to save \\nhim from Allah, and he could not defend \\nhimself.\\n148\\n29. THE SPIDER (al-’Ankabut)\\n82. Those who had wished they were in his po\\ufffesition the day before were saying, “Indeed, it \\nis Allah who spreads the bounty to whomever \\nHe wills of His servants, and restricts it. Had \\nAllah not been gracious to us, He would have \\ncaved in on us. No wonder the ungrateful \\nnever prosper.”\\n83. That Home of the Hereafter—We assign it \\nfor those who seek no superiority on earth, \\nnor corruption. And the outcome is for the \\ncautious.\\n84. Whoever brings a virtue will receive better \\nthan it. But whoever brings evil—the evildo\\ufffeers will be rewarded only according to what \\nthey used to do.\\n85. He Who ordained the Quran for you will \\nreturn you Home. Say, “My Lord knows best \\nwho comes with guidance, and who is in \\nmanifest error.”\\n86. You did not expect the Scripture to be \\ntransmitted to you, except as mercy from \\nyour Lord. Therefore, do not be a supporter \\nof the disbelievers.\\n87. And do not let them divert you from Al\\ufffelah’s revelations after they have been revealed \\nto you. And pray to your Lord, and never be \\nof the polytheists.\\n88. And do not invoke with Allah any other \\ngod. There is no god but He. All things per\\ufffeish, except His presence. His is the judgment, \\nand to Him you will be returned.\\n29. THE SPIDER\\n(al-’Ankabut)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Alif, Lam, Meem.\\n2. Have the people supposed that they will be \\nleft alone to say, “We believe,” without being \\nput to the test?\\n3. We have tested those before them. Allah \\nwill surely know the truthful, and He will \\nsurely know the liars.\\n4. Or do those who commit sins think they can \\nfool Us? Terrible is their opinion!\\n5. Whoever looks forward to the meeting with \\nAllah—the appointed time of Allah is com\\ufffeing. He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.\\n6. Whoever strives, strives only for himself. \\nAllah is Independent of the beings.\\n7. Those who believe and do righteous \\ndeeds—We will remit their sins, and We will \\nreward them according to the best of what \\nthey used to do.\\n8. We have advised the human being to be \\ngood to his parents. But if they urge you to \\nassociate with Me something you have no \\nknowledge of, do not obey them. To Me is \\nyour return; and I will inform you of what \\nyou used to do.\\n9. Those who believe and do good works—We\\nwill admit them into the company of the \\nrighteous.\\n10. Among the people is he who says, “We \\nhave believed in Allah.” Yet when he is \\nharmed on Allah’s account, he equates the \\npeople's persecution with Allah’s retribution. \\nAnd if help comes from your Lord, he says, \\n“We were actually with you.” Is not Allah \\naware of what is inside the hearts of the peo\\ufffeple?\\n11. Allah certainly knows those who believe, \\nand He certainly knows the hypocrites.\\n12. Those who disbelieve say to those who be\\ufffelieve, “Follow our way, and we will carry your \\nsins.” In no way can they carry any of their \\nsins. They are liars.\\n13. They will carry their own loads, and other \\nloads with their own. And they will be ques\\ufffetioned on the Day of Resurrection concern\\ufffeing what they used to fabricate.\\n14. We sent Noah to his people, and He stayed \\namong them for a thousand years minus fifty \\nyears. Then the Deluge swept them; for they \\nwere wrongdoers.\\n15. But We saved him, together with the com\\ufffepany of the Ark, and We made it a sign for all \\npeoples.\\n149\\n29. THE SPIDER (al-’Ankabut)\\n16. And Abraham, when he said to his people, \\n“Worship Allah, and fear Him. That is better \\nfor you, if you only knew.\\n17. You worship idols besides Allah, and you \\nfabricate falsehoods. Those you worship, in\\ufffestead of Allah, cannot provide you with live\\ufffelihood. So seek your livelihood from Allah, \\nand worship Him, and thank Him. To Him \\nyou will be returned.”\\n18. If you disbelieve, communities before you \\nhave also disbelieved. The Messenger is only \\nresponsible for clear transmission.\\n19. Have they not seen how Allah originates \\nthe creation, and then reproduces it? This is \\neasy for Allah.\\n20. Say, “Roam the earth, and observe how He \\noriginated the creation.” Then Allah will \\nbring about the next existence. Allah has \\npower over all things.” \\n21. He punishes whom He wills, and He grants \\nmercy to whom He wills, and to Him you will \\nbe restored.\\n22. You cannot escape, on earth or in the \\nheaven; and you have no protector and no \\nsavior besides Allah.\\n23. Those who disbelieved in Allah’s signs and \\nHis encounter—these have despaired of My \\nmercy. For them is a painful torment.\\n24. But the only response from his people was \\ntheir saying, “Kill him, or burn him.” But Al\\ufffelah saved him from the fire. Surely in that are \\nsigns for people who believe.\\n25. And he said, “You have chosen idols in\\ufffestead of Allah, out of affection for one an\\ufffeother in the worldly life. But then, on the Day \\nof Resurrection, you will disown one another, \\nand curse one another. Your destiny is Hell, \\nand you will have no saviors.”\\n26. Then Lot believed in him, and said, “I am \\nemigrating to my Lord. He is the Noble, the \\nWise.”\\n27. And We granted him Isaac and Jacob, and \\nconferred on his descendants the \\nProphethood and the Book, and gave him his \\nreward in this life; and in the Hereafter he will \\nbe among the upright.\\n28. And Lot, when he said to his people, “You \\nare committing an obscenity not perpetrated \\nbefore you by anyone in the whole world.\\n29. You approach men, and cut off the way, \\nand commit lewdness in your gatherings.” \\nBut the only response from his people was to \\nsay, “Bring upon us Allah’s punishment, if \\nyou are truthful.”\\n30. He said, “My Lord, help me against the \\npeople of corruption.”\\n31. And when Our envoys brought Abraham \\nthe good news, they said, “We are going to \\ndestroy the people of this town; its people are \\nwrongdoers.”\\n32. He said, “Yet Lot is in it.” They said, “We \\nare well aware of who is in it. We will save \\nhim, and his family, except for his wife, who \\nwill remain behind.”\\n33. Then, when Our envoys came to Lot, they \\nwere mistreated, and he was troubled and \\ndistressed on their account. They said, “Do \\nnot fear, nor grieve. We will save you and \\nyour family, except for your wife, who will re\\ufffemain behind.”\\n34. “We will bring down upon the people of \\nthis town a scourge from heaven, because of \\ntheir wickedness.”\\n35. And We left behind a clear trace of it, for \\npeople who understand.\\n36. And to Median, their brother Shuaib. He \\nsaid, “O my people, worship Allah and antic\\ufffeipate the Last Day, and do not spread corrup\\ufffetion in the land.”\\n37. But they rejected him, so the tremor over\\ufffetook them, and they were left motionless in \\ntheir homes.\\n38. And Aad and Thamood. It has become \\nclear to you from their dwellings. Satan em\\ufffebellished for them their deeds, barring them \\nfrom the path, even though they could see.\\n150\\n29. THE SPIDER (al-’Ankabut)\\n39. And Quaroon, and Pharaoh, and Ha\\ufffemaan—Moses went to them with clear argu\\ufffements, but they acted arrogantly in the land. \\nAnd they could not get ahead.\\n40. Each We seized by his sin. Against some \\nWe sent a sandstorm. Some were struck by \\nthe Blast. Some We caused the ground to cave \\nin beneath them. And some We drowned. It \\nwas not Allah who wronged them, but it was \\nthey who wronged their own selves.\\n41. The likeness of those who take to them\\ufffeselves protectors other than Allah is that of \\nthe spider. It builds a house. But the most \\nfragile of houses is the spider’s house. If they \\nonly knew.\\n42. Allah knows what they invoke besides \\nHim. He is the Almighty, the Wise.\\n43. These examples—We put them forward to \\nthe people; but none grasps them except the \\nlearned.\\n44. Allah created the heavens and the earth \\nwith truth. Surely in that is a sign for the be\\ufffelievers.\\n45. Recite what is revealed to you of the Scrip\\ufffeture, and perform the prayer. The prayer pre\\ufffevents indecencies and evils. And the remem\\ufffebrance of Allah is greater. And Allah knows \\nwhat you do.\\n46. And do not argue with the People of the \\nScripture except in the best manner possible, \\nexcept those who do wrong among them. \\nAnd say, “We believe in what was revealed to \\nus, and in what was revealed to you; and our \\nGod and your God is One; and to Him we are \\nsubmissive.”\\n47. Likewise, We revealed to you the Scripture. \\nThose to whom We gave the Scripture believe \\nin it, and some of these believe in it. None re\\ufffenounce Our communications except the dis\\ufffebelievers.\\n48. You did not read any scripture before this, \\nnor did you write it down with your right \\nhand; otherwise the falsifiers would have \\ndoubted.\\n49. In fact, it is clear signs in the hearts of those \\ngiven knowledge. No one renounce Our signs \\nexcept the unjust.\\n50. And they said, “If only a miracle from his \\nLord was sent down to him.” Say, “Miracles \\nare only with Allah, and I am only a clear \\nwarner.”\\n51. Does it not suffice them that We revealed \\nto you the Scripture, which is recited to them? \\nIn that is mercy and a reminder for people \\nwho believe. \\n52. Say, “Allah suffices as witness between you \\nand me. He knows everything in the heavens \\nand the Earth. Those who believe in vanity \\nand reject Allah—it is they who are the los\\ufffeers.”\\n53. And they urge you to hasten the punish\\ufffement. Were it not for a specified time, the \\npunishment would have come to them. But it \\nwill come upon them suddenly, while they \\nare unaware.\\n54. They urge you to hasten the punishment. \\nBut Hell will engulf the disbelievers.\\n55. On the Day when the punishment will en\\ufffevelop them, from above them, and from be\\ufffeneath their feet, He will say, “Taste what you \\nused to do!”\\n56. O My servants who have believed: My \\nearth is vast, so worship Me alone.\\n57. Every soul will taste death. Then to Us you \\nwill be returned.\\n58. Those who believe and work righteous\\ufffeness—We will settle them in Paradise, in \\nmansions under which rivers flow, dwelling \\ntherein forever. Excellent is the compensa\\ufffetion for the workers.\\n59. Those who endure patiently, and in their \\nLord they trust.\\n60. How many a creature there is that does not \\ncarry its provision? Allah provides for them, \\nand for you. He is the Hearer, the Knowl\\ufffeedgeable.\\n61. And if you asked them, “Who created the \\nheavens and the earth and regulated the sun \\n151\\n30. THE ROMANS (ar-Rum)\\nand the moon?” They would say, “Allah.” \\nWhy then do they deviate?\\n62. Allah expands the provision for whomever \\nHe wills of His servants, and restricts it. Allah \\nis Cognizant of all things.\\n63. And if you asked them, “Who sends water \\ndown from the sky, with which He revives the \\nearth after it had died?” They would say, “Al\\ufffelah.” Say, “Praise be to Allah.” But most of \\nthem do not understand.\\n64. The life of this world is nothing but diver\\ufffesion and play, and the Home of the Hereafter \\nis the Life, if they only knew.\\n65. When they embark on a vessel, they pray \\nto Allah, devoting their faith to Him; but \\nonce He has delivered them safely to land, \\nthey attribute partners to Him.\\n66. To be ungrateful for what We have given \\nthem, and to enjoy themselves. They will \\nsurely come to know.\\n67. Do they not see that We established a Se\\ufffecure Sanctuary, while all around them the \\npeople are being carried away? Do they be\\ufffelieve in falsehood, and reject the blessings of \\nAllah?\\n68. And who does greater wrong than he who \\nfabricates lies and attributes them to Allah, or \\ncalls the truth a lie when it has come to him? \\nIs there not in Hell a dwelling for the blas\\ufffephemers?\\n69. As for those who strive for Us—We will \\nguide them in Our ways. Allah is with the do\\ufffeers of good.\\n30. THE ROMANS\\n(ar-Rum)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Alif, Lam, Meem.\\n2. The Romans have been defeated.\\n3. In a nearby territory. But following their de\\ufffefeat, they will be victorious.\\n4. In a few years. The matter is up to Allah, in \\nthe past, and in the future. On that day, the \\nbelievers will rejoice.\\n5. In Allah’s support. He supports whomever \\nHe wills. He is the Almighty, the Merciful.\\n6. The promise of Allah—Allah never breaks \\nHis promise, but most people do not know.\\n7. They know an outer aspect of the worldly \\nlife, but they are heedless of the Hereafter.\\n8. Do they not reflect within themselves? Al\\ufffelah did not create the heavens and the earth, \\nand what is between them, except with rea\\ufffeson, and for a specific duration. But most \\npeople, regarding meeting their Lord, are dis\\ufffebelievers.\\n9. Have they not travelled the earth and seen \\nhow those before them ended up? They were \\nmore powerful than them, and they culti\\ufffevated the land and developed it more than \\nthey developed it, and their messengers came \\nto them with clear signs. Allah would never \\nwrong them, but they used to wrong them\\ufffeselves.\\n10. Then, evil was the end of those who com\\ufffemitted evil. That is because they rejected Al\\ufffelah’s revelations, and used to ridicule them.\\n11. Allah originates creation, and then repeats \\nit. Then to Him you will be returned.\\n12. On the Day when the Hour takes place, the \\nguilty will despair.\\n13. They will have no intercessors from among \\ntheir idols, and they will disown their part\\ufffeners.\\n14. On the Day when the Hour takes place—\\non that Day they will separate.\\n15. As for those who believed and did good \\ndeeds—they will be delighted in meadows.\\n16. But as for those who disbelieved, and re\\ufffejected Our signs and the encounter of the \\nHereafter—those will be hauled into the tor\\ufffement.\\n17. So glorify Allah when you retire at night, \\nand when you rise in the morning.\\n152\\n30. THE ROMANS (ar-Rum)\\n18. His is the praise in the heavens and on \\nearth, and in the evening, and when you \\nreach midday.\\n19. He brings the living out of the dead, and He \\nbrings the dead out of the living, and He re\\ufffevives the land after it had died. Likewise you \\nwill be resurrected.\\n20. And of His signs is that He created you \\nfrom dust; and behold, you become humans \\nspreading out.\\n21. And of His signs is that He created for you \\nmates from among yourselves, so that you \\nmay find tranquility in them; and He planted \\nlove and compassion between you. In this are \\nsigns for people who reflect.\\n22. And of His signs is the creation of the heav\\ufffeens and the earth, and the diversity of your \\nlanguages and colors. In this are signs for \\nthose who know.\\n23. And of His signs are your sleep by night \\nand day, and your pursuit of His bounty. In \\nthis are signs for people who listen.\\n24. And of His signs is that He shows you the \\nlightning, causing fear and hope. And He \\nbrings down water from the sky, and with it \\nHe revives the earth after it was dead. In this \\nare signs for people who understand.\\n25. And of His signs is that the heaven and the \\nearth stand at His disposal. And then, when \\nHe calls you out of the earth, you will emerge \\nat once.\\n26. To Him belongs everyone in the heavens \\nand the earth. All are submissive to Him.\\n27. It is He who initiates creation, and then re\\ufffepeats it, something easy for Him. His is the \\nhighest attribute, in the heavens and the \\nearth. He is the Almighty, the Wise.\\n28. He illustrates an example for you, from \\nyour own selves: do you make your servants \\nfull partners in the wealth We have given \\nyou? Do you revere them as you revere one \\nanother? We thus explain the revelations for \\na people who understand.\\n29. Yet the wrongdoers follow their desires \\nwithout knowledge. But who can guide \\nwhom Allah leaves astray? They will have no \\nhelpers.\\n30. So devote yourself to the religion of mono\\ufffetheism—the natural instinct Allah has in\\ufffestilled in mankind. There is no altering Al\\ufffelah’s creation. This is the true religion, but \\nmost people do not know.\\n31. Turning towards Him—and be conscious \\nof Him, and perform the prayer, and do not \\nbe of the idolaters.\\n32. Of those who divided their religion, and \\nbecame sects; each faction pleased with what \\nthey have.\\n33. When affliction touches the people, they \\ncall on their Lord, turning to Him in repent\\ufffeance. But then, when He gives them a taste of \\nHis mercy, some of them attribute partners to \\ntheir Lord.\\n34. To show ingratitude for what We have \\ngiven them. Indulge yourselves—you will \\nsurely know.\\n35. Have We sent down to them any authority, \\nwhich speaks in support of their idols?\\n36. When We give people a taste of mercy, they \\nrejoice in it. But when adversity befalls them, \\nbecause of what their hands have perpetrated, \\nthey begin to despair.\\n37. Do they not see that Allah expands the pro\\ufffevision for whomever He wills, or restricts it? \\nSurely in this are signs for people who be\\ufffelieve.\\n38. So give the relative his rights, and the des\\ufffetitute, and the wayfarer. That is best for those \\nwho seek Allah’s presence. Those are the \\nprosperous.\\n39. The usury you practice, seeking thereby to \\nmultiply people’s wealth, will not multiply \\nwith Allah. But what you give in charity, de\\ufffesiring Allah’s approval—these are the multi\\ufffepliers.\\n40. Allah is He who created you, then provides \\nfor you, then makes you die, then brings you \\nback to life. Can any of your idols do any of \\nthat? Glorified is He, and Exalted above what \\nthey associate.\\n153\\n31. LUQMAN (Luqman)\\n41. Corruption has appeared on land and sea, \\nbecause of what people’s hands have earned, \\nin order to make them taste some of what \\nthey have done, so that they might return.\\n42. Say, “Roam the earth, and observe the fate \\nof those who came before. Most of them were \\nidolaters.”\\n43. So devote yourself to the upright religion, \\nbefore there comes from Allah a Day that \\ncannot be averted. On that Day, they will be \\nshocked.\\n44. Whoever disbelieves, upon him falls his \\ndisbelief. And whoever acts righteously—\\nthey are preparing for themselves.\\n45. So that He may reward those who have be\\ufffelieved and done the righteous deeds out of \\nHis bounty. Indeed, He does not love the un\\ufffegrateful.\\n46. And of His signs is that He sends the winds \\nbearing good news, to give you a taste of His \\nmercy, and so that the ships may sail by His \\ncommand, and so that you may seek of His \\nbounty, and so that you may give thanks.\\n47. Before you, We sent messengers to their \\npeople. They came to them with clear proofs. \\nThen We took revenge on those who sinned. \\nIt is incumbent on Us to help the believers.\\n48. Allah is He who sends the winds. They stir \\nup clouds. Then He spreads them in the sky \\nas He wills. And He breaks them apart. Then \\nyou see rain drops issuing from their midst. \\nThen, when He makes it fall upon whom He \\nwills of His servants, behold, they rejoice.\\n49. Although they were before this—before it \\nwas sent down upon them—in despair.\\n50. So observe the effects of Allah’s mercy—\\nhow He revives the earth after it was dead. In\\ufffedeed, He is the Reviver of the dead. He is Ca\\ufffepable of everything.\\n51. But if We send a wind, and they see it turn\\ufffeing things yellow, they would continue there\\ufffeafter to disbelieve.\\n52. You cannot make the dead hear, nor can \\nyou make the deaf hear the call when they \\nturn away.\\n53. Nor can you guide the blind out of their er\\uffferor. You can make hear only those who be\\ufffelieve in Our signs, and so have submitted.\\n54. Allah is He Who created you weak, then af\\ufffeter weakness gave you strength, then after \\nstrength gave you weakness and gray hair. He \\ncreates whatever He wills. He is the Omnisci\\ufffeent, the Omnipotent.\\n55. On the Day when the Hour takes place, the \\nsinners will swear they had stayed but an \\nhour. Thus they were deluded.\\n56. But those endowed with knowledge and \\nfaith will say, “You remained in Allah’s Book \\nuntil the Day of Resurrection. This is the Day \\nof Resurrection, but you did not know.”\\n57. On that Day, the sinners’ excuses will not \\nbenefit them, nor will they be excused.\\n58. We have cited in this Quran for the people \\nevery sort of parable. But even if you bring \\nthem a miracle, those who disbelieve will say, \\n“You are nothing but fakers.”\\n59. Allah thus seals the hearts of those who do \\nnot know.\\n60. So be patient. The promise of Allah is true. \\nAnd do not let those who lack certainty belit\\ufffetle you.\\n31. LUQMAN\\n(Luqman)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Alif, Lam, Meem.\\n2. These are the Verses of the Wise Book.\\n3. A guide and a mercy for the righteous.\\n4. Those who observe the prayer, and pay the \\nobligatory charity, and are certain of the \\nHereafter. \\n5. These are upon guidance from their Lord. \\nThese are the successful.\\n6. Among the people is he who trades in dis\\ufffetracting tales; intending, without knowledge, \\nto lead away from Allah’s way, and to make a \\n154\\n31. LUQMAN (Luqman)\\nmockery of it. These will have a humiliating \\npunishment.\\n7. And when Our Verses are recited to him, he \\nturns away in pride, as though he did not hear \\nthem, as though there is deafness in his ears. \\nSo inform him of a painful punishment.\\n8. As for those who believe and do good \\ndeeds—for them are the Gardens of Bliss.\\n9. Dwelling therein forever. The promise of \\nAllah is true. He is the Mighty, the Wise.\\n10. He created the heavens without pillars that \\nyou can see, and placed stabilizers on earth \\nlest it shifts with you, and scattered through\\ufffeout it all kinds of creatures. And from the sky \\nWe sent down water, and caused to grow \\ntherein of every noble pair.\\n11. Such is Allah’s creation. Now show me \\nwhat those besides Him have created. In fact, \\nthe wicked are in obvious error.\\n12. We endowed Luqman with wisdom: “Give \\nthanks to Allah.” Whoever is appreciative—\\nis appreciative for the benefit of his own soul. \\nAnd whoever is unappreciative—Allah is \\nSufficient and Praiseworthy.\\n13. When Luqman said to his son, as he ad\\ufffevised him, “O my son, do not associate any\\ufffething with Allah, for idolatry is a terrible \\nwrong.”\\n14. We have entrusted the human being with \\nthe care of his parents. His mother carried \\nhim through hardship upon hardship, wean\\ufffeing him in two years. So give thanks to Me, \\nand to your parents. To Me is the destination.\\n15. But if they strive to have you associate with \\nMe something of which you have no\\nknowledge, do not obey them. But keep them \\ncompany in this life, in kindness, and follow \\nthe path of him who turns to Me. Then to Me \\nis your return; and I will inform you of what \\nyou used to do.\\n16. “O my son, even if it were the weight of a \\nmustard-seed, in a rock, or in the heavens, or \\non earth, Allah will bring it to light. Allah is \\nKind and Expert.\\n17. O my son, observe the prayer, advocate \\nrighteousness, forbid evil, and be patient over \\nwhat has befallen you. These are of the most \\nhonorable traits.\\n18. And do not treat people with arrogance, \\nnor walk proudly on earth. Allah does not \\nlove the arrogant showoffs.\\n19. And moderate your stride, and lower your \\nvoice. The most repulsive of voices is the \\ndonkey’s voice.”\\n20. Do you not see how Allah placed at your \\nservice everything in the heavens and the \\nearth? How He showered you with His bless\\ufffeings, both outward and inward? Yet among \\nthe people is he who argues about Allah with\\ufffeout knowledge, without guidance, and with\\ufffeout an enlightening Scripture.\\n21. And when it is said to them, “Follow what \\nAllah has revealed,” they say, “Rather, we fol\\ufffelow what we found our parents devoted to.” \\nEven if Satan is calling them to the suffering \\nof the Blaze? \\n22. Whoever submits himself wholly to Allah, \\nand is a doer of good, has grasped the most \\ntrustworthy handle. With Allah rests the out\\ufffecome of all events.\\n23. Whoever disbelieves—let not his disbelief \\nsadden you. To Us is their return. Then We \\nwill inform them of what they did. Allah \\nknows what lies within the hearts.\\n24. We give them a little comfort; then We \\ncompel them to a harsh torment.\\n25. And if you ask them, “Who created the \\nheavens and the earth?” They will say, “Al\\ufffelah.” Say, “Praise be to Allah.” But most of \\nthem do not know.\\n26. To Allah belongs everything in the heavens \\nand the earth. Allah is the Rich, the Praised.\\n27. If all the trees on earth were pens, filled by \\nthe ocean, with seven more oceans besides, \\nthe Words of Allah would not run out. Allah \\nis Majestic and Wise.\\n28. Your creation and your resurrection are \\nonly as a single soul. Allah is Hearing and \\nSeeing.\\n155\\n32. PROSTRATION (as-Sajdah)\\n29. Have you not seen how Allah merges the \\nnight into the day, and merges the day into \\nthe night? That He subjected the sun and the \\nmoon, each running for a stated term? And \\nthat Allah is Cognizant of everything you do?\\n30. That is because Allah is the Reality, and \\nwhat they worship besides Him is falsehood, \\nand because Allah is the Exalted, the Su\\ufffepreme.\\n31. Have you not seen how the ships sail \\nthrough the sea, by the grace of Allah, to \\nshow you of His wonders? In that are signs \\nfor every persevering, thankful person.\\n32. When waves, like canopies, cover them, \\nthey call upon Allah, devoting their religion \\nto Him. But when He has delivered them to \\ndry land, some of them waver. No one re\\ufffenounces Our revelations except the treacher\\ufffeous blasphemer.\\n33. O people! Be conscious of your Lord, and \\ndread a Day when no parent can avail his \\nchild, nor can a child avail his parent, in any\\ufffething. The promise of Allah is true. There\\ufffefore, do not let this life deceive you, nor let \\nillusions deceive you regarding Allah.\\n34. With Allah rests the knowledge of the \\nHour. He sends down the rain, and He knows \\nwhat the wombs contain. No soul knows \\nwhat it will reap tomorrow, and no soul \\nknows in what land it will die. Allah is All\\ufffeKnowing, Well-Informed.\\n32. PROSTRATION\\n(as-Sajdah)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Alif, Lam, Meem.\\n2. The revelation of the Book, without a doubt, \\nis from the Lord of the Universe.\\n3. Yet they say, “He made it up.” In fact, it is \\nthe Truth from your Lord, to warn a people \\nwho received no warner before you, that they \\nmay be guided.\\n4. Allah is He who created the heavens and the \\nearth and everything between them in six \\ndays, and then established Himself on the \\nThrone. Apart from Him, you have no mas\\ufffeter and no intercessor. Will you not reflect?\\n5. He regulates all affairs, from the heavens, to \\nthe earth. Then it ascends to Him on a Day \\nthe length of which is a thousand years by \\nyour count.\\n6. That is the Knower of the Invisible and the \\nVisible, the Powerful, the Merciful.\\n7. He who perfected everything He created, \\nand originated the creation of man from clay.\\n8. Then made his reproduction from an ex\\ufffetract of an insignificant fluid.\\n9. Then He proportioned him, and breathed \\ninto him of His Spirit. Then He gave you the \\nhearing, and the eyesight, and the brains—\\nbut rarely do you give thanks.\\n10. And they say, “When we are lost into the \\nearth, shall we be in a new creation?” In fact, \\nthey deny the meeting with their Lord.\\n11. Say, “The angel of death put in charge of \\nyou will reclaim you. Then to your Lord you \\nwill be returned.”\\n12. If only you could see the guilty, bowing \\ntheir heads before their Lord: “Our Lord, we \\nhave seen and we have heard, so send us back, \\nand we will act righteously; we are now con\\ufffevinced.”\\n13. Had We willed, We could have given every \\nsoul its guidance, but the declaration from \\nMe will come true: “I will fill Hell with jinn \\nand humans, altogether.”\\n14. So taste, because you forgot the meeting of \\nthis Day of yours; We have forgotten you; so \\ntaste the eternal torment for what you used to \\ndo.\\n15. They believe in Our communications, \\nthose who, when reminded of them, fall \\ndown prostrate, and glorify their Lord with \\npraise, and are not proud.\\n16. Their sides shun their beds, as they pray to \\ntheir Lord, out of reverence and hope; and \\nfrom Our provisions to them, they give.\\n156\\n33. THE CONFEDERATES (al-Ahzab)\\n17. No soul knows what eye’s delight awaits \\nthem—a reward for what they used to do.\\n18. Is someone who is faithful like someone \\nwho is a sinner? They are not equal.\\n19. As for those who believe and do righteous \\ndeeds, for them are the Gardens of Shelter—\\nhospitality for what they used to do.\\n20. But as for those who transgressed, their \\nshelter is the Fire. Every time they try to get \\nout of it, they will be brought back into it, and \\nit will be said to them, “Taste the suffering of \\nthe Fire which you used to deny.”\\n21. We will make them taste the lesser tor\\ufffement, prior to the greater torment, so that \\nthey may return.\\n22. Who is more wrong than he, who, when \\nreminded of his Lord’s revelations, turns \\naway from them? We will certainly wreak \\nvengeance upon the criminals.\\n23. We gave Moses the Book; so do not be in \\ndoubt regarding His encounter; and We \\nmade it a guidance for the Children of Israel.\\n24. And We appointed leaders from among \\nthem, guiding by Our command, as long as \\nthey persevered and were certain of Our \\ncommunications.\\n25. Your Lord will judge between them on the \\nDay of Resurrection regarding everything \\nthey had disputed.\\n26. Is it not a lesson for them, how many gen\\ufffeerations We have destroyed before them, in \\nwhose habitations they walk? Surely in that \\nare signs. Do they not hear?\\n27. Do they not see how We conduct the water \\nto a dry land, and with it We produce vegeta\\ufffetion, from which their livestock eat, and \\nthemselves? Do they not see?\\n28. And they say, “When is this victory, if you \\nare truthful?”\\n29. Say, “On the day of victory, the faith of \\nthose who disbelieved will be of no avail to \\nthem, and they will not be granted respite.”\\n30. So turn away from them, and wait. They \\ntoo are waiting.\\n33. THE CONFEDERATES\\n(al-Ahzab)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. O Prophet! Fear Allah, and do not obey the \\nunbelievers and the hypocrites. Allah is \\nKnowledgeable and Wise.\\n2. And follow what is revealed to you from \\nyour Lord. Allah is fully aware of what you \\ndo.\\n3. And put your trust in Allah. Allah is enough \\nas a trustee.\\n4. Allah did not place two hearts inside any \\nman's body. Nor did He make your wives \\nwhom you equate with your mothers, your \\nactual mothers. Nor did He make your \\nadopted sons, your actual sons. These are \\nyour words coming out of your mouths. Al\\ufffelah speaks the truth, and guides to the path.\\n5. Call them after their fathers; that is more \\nequitable with Allah. But if you do not know \\ntheir fathers, then your brethren in faith and \\nyour friends. There is no blame on you if you \\nerr therein, barring what your hearts pre\\ufffemeditates. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.\\n6. The Prophet is more caring of the believers \\nthan they are of themselves, and his wives are \\nmothers to them. And blood-relatives are \\ncloser to one another in Allah’s Book than the \\nbelievers or the emigrants, though you \\nshould do good to your friends. That is in\\ufffescribed in the Book.\\n7. Recall that We received a pledge from the \\nprophets, and from you, and from Noah, and \\nAbraham, and Moses, and Jesus son of Mary. \\nWe received from them a solemn pledge.\\n8. That He may ask the sincere about their sin\\ufffecerity. He has prepared for the disbelievers a \\npainful punishment.\\n9. O you who believe! Remember Allah’s \\nblessings upon you, when forces came against \\nyou, and We sent against them a wind, and \\n157\\n33. THE CONFEDERATES (al-Ahzab)\\nforces you did not see. Allah is Observant of \\nwhat you do.\\n10. When they came upon you, from above \\nyou, and from beneath you; and the eyes be\\ufffecame dazed, and the hearts reached the \\nthroats, and you harbored doubts about Al\\ufffelah.\\n11. There and then the believers were tested, \\nand were shaken most severely.\\n12. When the hypocrites and those in whose \\nhearts is sickness said, “Allah and His Mes\\ufffesenger promised us nothing but illusion.”\\n13. And when a group of them said, “O people \\nof Yathrib, you cannot make a stand, so re\\ufffetreat.” And a faction of them asked the \\nProphet to excuse them, saying, “Our homes \\nare exposed,” although they were not ex\\ufffeposed. They only wanted to flee.\\n14. Had it been invaded from its sides, and \\nthey were asked to dissent, they would have \\ndone so with little hesitation.\\n15. Although they had made a pledged to Al\\ufffelah, in the past, that they will not turn their \\nbacks. A pledge to Allah is a responsibility.\\n16. Say, “Flight will not benefit you, if you flee \\nfrom death or killing, even then you will be \\ngiven only brief enjoyment.”\\n17. Say, “Who is it who will shield you from \\nAllah, if He intends adversity for you, or in\\ufffetends mercy for you?” Besides Allah, they will \\nfind for themselves neither friend nor helper.\\n18. Allah already knows the hinderers among \\nyou, and those who say to their brethren, \\n“Come and join us.” Rarely do they mobilize \\nfor battle.\\n19. Being stingy towards you. And when fear \\napproaches, you see them staring at you—\\ntheir eyes rolling—like someone fainting at \\ndeath. Then, when panic is over, they whip \\nyou with sharp tongues. They resent you any \\ngood. These have never believed, so Allah has \\nnullified their works; a matter easy for Allah.\\n20. They assumed that the confederates had \\nnot withdrawn. But were the confederates to \\nadvance, they would wish they were in the de\\ufffesert with the Bedouins, inquiring about your \\nnews. And if they were among you, they \\nwould have done little fighting.\\n21. You have an excellent example in the Mes\\ufffesenger of Allah; for anyone who seeks Allah \\nand the Last Day, and remembers Allah fre\\ufffequently.\\n22. And when the believers saw the confeder\\ufffeates, they said, “This is what Allah and His \\nmessenger have promised us; and Allah and \\nHis messenger have told the truth.” And it \\nonly increased them in faith and submission.\\n23. Of the believers are men who are true to \\nwhat they pledged to Allah. Some of them \\nhave fulfilled their vows; and some are still \\nwaiting, and never wavering.\\n24. That Allah may reward the truthful for \\ntheir truthfulness; and punish the hypocrites, \\nif He wills, or pardon them. Allah is Forgiv\\ufffeing and Merciful.\\n25. Allah repelled the disbelievers in their rage; \\nthey gained no advantage. Allah thus spared \\nthe believers combat. Allah is Strong and \\nMighty.\\n26. And He brought down from their strong\\ufffeholds those of the People of the Book who \\nbacked them, and He threw terror into their \\nhearts. Some of them you killed, and others \\nyou took captive.\\n27. And He made you inherit their land, and \\ntheir homes, and their possessions, and a re\\ufffegion you have never stepped on. Allah has \\npower over all things.\\n28. O Prophet! Say to your wives, “If you desire \\nthe life of this world and its finery, then let me \\ncompensate you, and release you kindly.\\n29. But if you desire Allah, His Messenger, and \\nthe Home of the Hereafter, then Allah has \\nprepared for the righteous among you a mag\\ufffenificent compensation.”\\n30. O wives of the Prophet! Whoever of you \\ncommits a proven indecency, the punish\\ufffement for her will be doubled. And that would \\nbe easy for Allah.\\n158\\n33. THE CONFEDERATES (al-Ahzab)\\n31. But whoever of you remains obedient to \\nAllah and His Messenger, and acts right\\ufffeeously, We will give her a double reward; and \\nWe have prepared for her a generous provi\\ufffesion.\\n32. O wives of the Prophet! You are not like \\nany other women, if you observe piety. So do \\nnot speak too softly, lest the sick at heart lusts \\nafter you, but speak in an appropriate man\\ufffener.\\n33. And settle in your homes; and do not dis\\ufffeplay yourselves, as in the former days of igno\\uffferance. And perform the prayer, and give reg\\ufffeular charity, and obey Allah and His Messen\\ufffeger. Allah desires to remove all impurity from \\nyou, O People of the Household, and to pu\\uffferify you thoroughly.\\n34. And remember what is recited in your \\nhomes of Allah's revelations and wisdom. Al\\ufffelah is Kind and Informed.\\n35. Muslim men and Muslim women, believ\\ufffeing men and believing women, obedient men \\nand obedient women, truthful men and \\ntruthful women, patient men and patient \\nwomen, humble men and humble women, \\ncharitable men and charitable women, fast\\ufffeing men and fasting women, men who guard \\ntheir chastity and women who guard, men \\nwho remember Allah frequently and women \\nwho remember—Allah has prepared for \\nthem a pardon, and an immense reward.\\n36. It is not for any believer, man or woman, \\nwhen Allah and His Messenger have decided \\na matter, to have liberty of choice in their de\\ufffecision. Whoever disobeys Allah and His Mes\\ufffesenger has gone far astray.\\n37. When you said to him whom Allah had \\nblessed, and you had favored, “Keep your \\nwife to yourself, and fear Allah.” But you hid \\nwithin yourself what Allah was to reveal. And \\nyou feared the people, but it was Allah you \\nwere supposed to fear. Then, when Zaid \\nended his relationship with her, We gave her \\nto you in marriage, that there may be no re\\ufffestriction for believers regarding the wives of \\ntheir adopted sons, when their relationship \\nhas ended. The command of Allah was ful\\ufffefilled.\\n38. There is no blame on the Prophet regard\\ufffeing what Allah has ordained for him. Such is \\nthe pattern of Allah among those who passed \\nbefore. The command of Allah is an absolute \\ndecree.\\n39. Those who deliver the messages of Allah, \\nand fear Him, and never fear anyone except \\nAllah. Allah is sufficient as a reckoner.\\n40. Muhammad is not the father of any of your \\nmen; but he is the Messenger of Allah, and \\nthe seal of the prophets. Allah is Cognizant of \\neverything.\\n41. O you who believe, remember Allah with \\nfrequent remembrance.\\n42. And glorify Him morning and evening.\\n43. It is He who reaches out to you, and His \\nangels, to bring you out of darkness into the \\nlight. And He is Ever-Merciful towards the \\nbelievers.\\n44. Their greeting on the Day they meet Him \\nis, “Peace,” and He has prepared for them a \\ngenerous reward.\\n45. O prophet! We have sent you as a witness, \\nand a bearer of good news, and a warner.\\n46. And a caller towards Allah by His leave, \\nand an illuminating beacon.\\n47. And give the believers the good news that \\nfor them is a great reward. \\n48. And do not obey the blasphemers and the \\nhypocrites, and ignore their insults, and rely \\non Allah. Allah is a sufficient protector.\\n49. O you who believe! When you marry be\\ufffelieving women, but then divorce them before \\nyou have touched them, there is no waiting \\nperiod for you to observe in respect to them; \\nbut compensate them, and release them in a\\ngraceful manner.\\n50. O Prophet! We have permitted to you your \\nwives to whom you have given their dowries, \\nand those you already have, as granted to you \\nby Allah, and the daughters of your paternal \\nuncle, and the daughters of your paternal \\n159\\n33. THE CONFEDERATES (al-Ahzab)\\naunts, and the daughters of your maternal \\nuncle, and the daughters of your maternal \\naunts who emigrated with you, and a believ\\ufffeing woman who has offered herself to the \\nProphet, if the Prophet desires to marry her, \\nexclusively for you, and not for the believers. \\nWe know what We have ordained for them \\nregarding their wives and those their right\\ufffehands possess. This is to spare you any diffi\\ufffeculty. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.\\n51. You may defer any of them you wish, and \\nreceive any of them you wish. Should you de\\ufffesire any of those you had deferred, there is no \\nblame on you. This is more proper, so that \\nthey will be comforted, and not be grieved, \\nand be content with what you have given \\neach one of them. Allah knows what is within \\nyour hearts. Allah is Omniscient and Clem\\ufffeent.\\n52. Beyond that, no other women are permis\\ufffesible for you, nor can you exchange them for \\nother wives, even if you admire their beauty, \\nexcept those you already have. Allah is \\nWatchful over all things.\\n53. O you who believe! Do not enter the homes \\nof the Prophet, unless you are given permis\\ufffesion to come for a meal; and do not wait for \\nits preparation. And when you are invited, go \\nin. And when you have eaten, disperse, with\\ufffeout lingering for conversation. This irritates \\nthe Prophet, and he shies away from you, but \\nAllah does not shy away from the truth. And \\nwhen you ask his wives for something, ask \\nthem from behind a screen; that is purer for \\nyour hearts and their hearts. You must never \\noffend the Messenger of Allah, nor must you \\never marry his wives after him, for that would \\nbe an enormity with Allah.\\n54. Whether you declare a thing, or hide it, Al\\ufffelah is Aware of all things.\\n55. There is no blame on them concerning \\ntheir fathers, or their sons, or their brothers, \\nor their brothers’ sons, or their sisters’ sons, \\nor their women, or their female servants. But \\nthey should remain conscious of Allah. Allah \\nis Witness over all things.\\n56. Allah and His angels give blessings to the \\nProphet. O you who believe, call for blessings \\non him, and greet him with a prayer of peace.\\n57. Those who insult Allah and His Messen\\ufffeger, Allah has cursed them in this life and in \\nthe Hereafter, and has prepared for them a \\ndemeaning punishment.\\n58. Those who harm believing men and believ\\ufffeing women, for acts they did not commit, \\nbear the burden of perjury and a flagrant sin.\\n59. O Prophet! Tell your wives, and your \\ndaughters, and the women of the believers, to \\nlengthen their garments. That is more \\nproper, so they will be recognized and not \\nharassed. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.\\n60. If the hypocrites, and those with sickness \\nin their hearts, and the rumormongers in the \\nCity, do not desist, We will incite you against \\nthem; then they will not be your neighbors \\nthere except for a short while. \\n61. They are cursed; wherever they are found, \\nthey should be captured and killed outright.\\n62. Such has been Allah’s precedent with those \\nwho passed away before. You will find no \\nchange in Allah’s system.\\n63. The people ask you about the Hour. Say, \\n“The knowledge thereof rests with Allah. But \\nwhat do you know? Perhaps the hour is near.”\\n64. Allah has cursed the disbelievers, and has \\nprepared for them a Blaze. \\n65. Dwelling therein forever, not finding a \\nprotector or a savior.\\n66. The Day when their faces are flipped into \\nthe Fire, they will say, “If only we had obeyed \\nAllah and obeyed the Messenger.”\\n67. And they will say, “Lord, we have obeyed \\nour superiors and our dignitaries, but they \\nled us away from the way.\\n68. Lord, give them double the punishment, \\nand curse them with a great curse.”\\n69. O you who believe! Do not be like those \\nwho abused Moses; but Allah cleared him of \\nwhat they said. He was distinguished with Al\\ufffelah.\\n160\\n34. SHEBA (Saba’)\\n70. O you who believe! Be conscious of Allah, \\nand speak in a straightforward manner. \\n71. He will rectify your conduct for you, and \\nwill forgive you your sins. Whoever obeys Al\\ufffelah and His Messenger has won a great vic\\ufffetory.\\n72. We offered the Trust to the heavens, and \\nthe earth, and the mountains; but they re\\ufffefused to bear it, and were apprehensive of it; \\nbut the human being accepted it. He was un\\ufffefair and ignorant.\\n73. Allah will punish the hypocrites, men and \\nwomen, and the idolaters, men and women. \\nAnd Allah will redeem the believers, men and \\nwomen. Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Mer\\ufffeciful.\\n34. SHEBA\\n(Saba’)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Praise be to Allah, to Whom belongs every\\ufffething in the heavens and the earth; and praise \\nbe to Him in the Hereafter. He is the Wise, \\nthe Expert.\\n2. He knows what penetrates into the earth, \\nand what comes out of it, and what descends \\nfrom the sky, and what ascends to it. He is the \\nMerciful, the Forgiving.\\n3. Those who disbelieve say, “The Hour will \\nnot come upon us.” Say, “Yes indeed, by my \\nLord, it will come upon you. He is the \\nKnower of the unseen.” Not an atom's weight \\nin the heavens and the earth, or anything \\nsmaller or larger, escapes His knowledge. All \\nare in a Clear Record.\\n4. That He may recompense those who believe \\nand do good works. Those will have for\\ufffegiveness, and a generous provision.\\n5. As for those who strive against Our revela\\ufffetions, seeking to undermine them—for them \\nis a punishment of a painful plague.\\n6. Those who received knowledge know that \\nwhat is revealed to you from your Lord is the \\ntruth; and it guides to the path of the Majes\\ufffetic, the Praiseworthy.\\n7. Those who disbelieved said, “Shall we point \\nout to you a man, who will tell you that, once \\ntorn into shreds, you will be in a new crea\\ufffetion?\\n8. Did he invent a lie about Allah, or is there \\nmadness in him?” Indeed, those who do not \\nbelieve in the Hereafter are in torment, and \\nfar astray.\\n9. Do they not reflect upon what lies before \\nthem and behind them, of the heaven and the \\nearth? If We will, We can make the earth cave \\nin beneath them, or make pieces of the sky \\nfall down on them. In that is a sign for every \\ndevout servant.\\n10. We bestowed upon David favor from Us: \\n“O mountains, and birds: echo with him.” \\nAnd We softened iron for him.\\n11. “Make coats of armor, and measure the \\nlinks well; and work righteousness. I am Ob\\ufffeservant of everything you do.”\\n12. And for Solomon the wind—its outward \\njourney was one month, and its return jour\\ufffeney was one month. And We made a spring \\nof tar flow for him. And there were sprites \\nthat worked under him, by the leave of his \\nLord. But whoever of them swerved from \\nOur command, We make him taste of the \\npunishment of the Inferno.\\n13. They made for him whatever he wished: \\nsanctuaries, statues, bowls like pools, and \\nheavy cauldrons. “O House of David, work \\nwith appreciation,” but a few of My servants \\nare appreciative.\\n14. Then, when We decreed death for him, \\nnothing indicated his death to them except an \\nearthworm eating at his staff. Then, when he \\nfell down, it became clear to the sprites that, \\nhad they known the unseen, they would not \\nhave remained in the demeaning torment.\\n15. In Sheba’s homeland there used to be a \\nwonder: two gardens, on the right, and on the \\nleft. “Eat of your Lord’s provision, and give \\nthanks to Him.” A good land, and a forgiving \\nLord.\\n161\\n34. SHEBA (Saba’)\\n16. But they turned away, so We unleashed \\nagainst them the flood of the dam; and We \\nsubstituted their two gardens with two gar\\ufffedens of bitter fruits, thorny shrubs, and mea\\ufffeger harvest.\\n17. We thus penalized them for their ingrati\\ufffetude. Would We penalize any but the un\\ufffegrateful?\\n18. Between them and the towns We had \\nblessed, We placed prominent towns, and \\nWe made the travel between them easy. \\n“Travel between them by night and day, in \\nsafety.”\\n19. But they said, “Our Lord, lengthen the dis\\ufffetances of our journeys.” They wronged them\\ufffeselves; so We made them history, and We \\nscattered them in every direction. In this are \\nlessons for every steadfast and appreciative \\nperson.\\n20. Satan was correct in his assessment of \\nthem. They followed him, except for a group \\nof believers.\\n21. He had no authority over them; except that \\nWe willed to distinguish him who believes in \\nthe Hereafter, from him who is doubtful \\nabout it. Your Lord is Guardian over all \\nthings.\\n22. Say, “Call upon those whom you claim be\\ufffesides Allah. They possess not an atom's \\nweight in the heavens or the earth, and they \\npossess no share of either, and He has no \\nbackers from among them.”\\n23. Intercession with Him is of no value, ex\\ufffecept for someone He has permitted. Until, \\nwhen fear has subsided from their hearts, \\nthey will say, “What did your Lord say?” They \\nwill say, “The truth, and He is the High, the \\nGreat.”\\n24. Say, “Who provides for you from the heav\\ufffeens and the earth?” Say, “Allah. And Either \\nyou, or we, are rightly guided, or in evident \\nerror.”\\n25. Say, “You will not be asked about our mis\\ufffedeeds, nor will we be asked about what you \\ndo.”\\n26. Say, “Our Lord will bring us together; then \\nHe will judge between us equitably. He is the \\nAll-Knowing Judge.”\\n27. Say, “Show me those you have attached to \\nHim as associates. No indeed! But He is Al\\ufffelah, the Powerful, the Wise.”\\n28. We sent you only universally to all people, \\na herald and warner, but most people do not \\nknow.\\n29. And they say, “When is this promise due, \\nif you are truthful?”\\n30. Say, “You are promised a Day, which you \\ncannot postpone by one hour, nor bring for\\ufffeward.”\\n31. Those who disbelieve say, “We will never \\nbelieve in this Quran, nor in what came be\\ufffefore it.” If you could only see the wrongdoers, \\ncaptive before their Lord, throwing back alle\\ufffegations at one another. Those who were op\\ufffepressed will say to those who were arrogant, \\n“Were it not for you, we would have been be\\ufffelievers.”\\n32. Those who were arrogant will say to those \\nwho were oppressed, “Was it us who turned \\nyou away from guidance when it came to \\nyou? No indeed, you yourselves were sinful.”\\n33. And those who were oppressed will say to \\nthose who were arrogant, “It was your \\nscheming by night and day; as you instructed \\nus to reject Allah, and to set up rivals to Him.” \\nThey will hide their remorse when they see \\nthe retribution. We will put yokes around the \\nnecks of those who disbelieved. Will they be \\nrepaid for anything other than what they \\nused to do?\\n34. We sent no warner to any town, without its \\naffluent saying, “We reject what you are sent \\nwith.”\\n35. And they say, “We have more wealth and \\nmore children, and we will not be punished.”\\n36. Say, “My Lord spreads out His bounty to \\nwhomever He wills, or restricts it; but most \\npeople do not know.”\\n37. It is neither your wealth nor your children \\nthat bring you closer to Us, but it is he who \\n162\\n35. ORIGINATOR (Fatir)\\nbelieves and does good deeds. These will have \\na double reward for what they did; and they \\nwill reside in the Chambers, in peace and se\\ufffecurity.\\n38. But those who work against Our revela\\ufffetions, seeking to undermine them—those will \\nbe summoned to the punishment.\\n39. Say, “My Lord extends the provision to \\nwhomever He wills of His servants, or with\\ufffeholds it. Anything you spend, He will replace \\nit. He is the Best of providers.”\\n40. On the Day when He gathers them all to\\ufffegether, then say to the angels, “Was it you \\nthese used to worship?”\\n41. They will say, “Be You glorified; You are \\nour Master, not them. In fact, they used to \\nworship the jinn, and most of them had faith \\nin them.”\\n42. “Today, none of you has the power to \\nprofit or harm the other.” And We will say to \\nthose who did wrong, “Taste the agony of the \\nFire which you used to deny.”\\n43. And when Our enlightening Verses are re\\ufffecited to them, they say, “This is nothing but a \\nman who wants to divert you from what your \\nancestors used to worship.” And they say, \\n“This is nothing but a fabricated lie.” And \\nwhen the Truth comes to them, the blas\\ufffephemers say of the Truth, “This is nothing \\nbut plain magic.”\\n44. But We gave them no book to study, and \\nWe did not send them any warner before you.\\n45. Those before them also denied the Truth, \\nyet they have not attained one-tenth of what \\nWe had given them. They rejected My mes\\ufffesengers, so how was My disapproval?\\n46. Say, “I offer you a single advice: devote \\nyourselves to Allah, in pairs, or individually; \\nand reflect. There is no madness in your \\nfriend. He is just a warner to you, before the \\nadvent of a severe punishment.”\\n47. Say, “Whatever compensation I have asked \\nof you, is yours. My compensation comes \\nonly from Allah, and He is Witness over all \\nthings.”\\n48. Say, “My Lord projects the truth. He is the \\nKnower of the Unseen.”\\n49. Say, “The Truth has come; while falsehood \\ncan neither originate, nor regenerate.”\\n50. Say, “If I err, I err only to my own loss; but \\nif I am guided, it is by what my Lord inspires \\nme. He is Hearing and Near.”\\n51. If you could only see when they are terri\\ufffefied, and there is no escape, and they are \\nseized from a nearby place. \\n52. And they say, “We have believed in it.” But \\nhow can they attain it from a distant place?\\n53. They have rejected it in the past, and made \\nallegations from a far-off place.\\n54. A barrier will be placed between them and \\nwhat they desire, as was done formerly with \\ntheir counterparts. They were in disturbing \\ndoubt.\\n35. ORIGINATOR\\n(Fatir)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Praise be to Allah, Originator of the heavens \\nand the earth, Maker of the angels messen\\ufffegers with wings—double, triple, and quadru\\ufffeple. He adds to creation as He wills. Allah is \\nAble to do all things.\\n2. Whatever mercy Allah unfolds for the peo\\ufffeple, none can withhold it. And if He with\\ufffeholds it, none can release it thereafter. He is \\nthe Exalted in Power, Full of Wisdom.\\n3. O people! Remember Allah’s blessings \\nupon you. Is there a creator other than Allah \\nwho provides for you from the heaven and \\nthe earth? There is no god but He. So how are \\nyou misled?\\n4. If they reject you, messengers before you \\nwere also rejected. To Allah all matters are re\\ufffeturned. \\n5. O people! The promise of Allah is true; so \\nlet not the lowly life seduce you, and let not \\nthe Tempter tempt you away from Allah.\\n163\\n35. ORIGINATOR (Fatir)\\n6. Satan is an enemy to you, so treat him as an \\nenemy. He only invites his gang to be among \\nthe inmates of the Inferno.\\n7. Those who disbelieve will suffer a harsh \\npunishment, but those who believe and do \\nrighteous deeds will have forgiveness and a \\ngreat reward.\\n8. What of him whose evil deed was made at\\ufffetractive to him, and so he regards it as good? \\nAllah leads astray whomever He wills, and He \\nguides whomever He wills. Therefore, do not \\nwaste yourself sorrowing over them. Allah \\nknows exactly what they do.\\n9. Allah is He who sends the winds, which ag\\ufffeitate clouds, which We drive to a dead land, \\nand thereby revive the ground after it had \\ndied. Likewise is the Resurrection.\\n10. Whoever desires honor—all honor belongs \\nto Allah. To Him ascends speech that is pure, \\nand He elevates righteous conduct. As for \\nthose who plot evil, a terrible punishment \\nawaits them, and the planning of these will \\nfail.\\n11. Allah created you from dust, then from a \\nsmall drop; then He made you pairs. No fe\\ufffemale conceives, or delivers, except with His \\nknowledge. No living thing advances in years, \\nor its life is shortened, except it be in a Rec\\ufffeord. That is surely easy for Allah.\\n12. The two seas are not the same. One is fresh, \\nsweet, good to drink, while the other is salty \\nand bitter. Yet from each you eat tender meat, \\nand extract jewelry which you wear. And you \\nsee the ships plowing through them, so that \\nyou may seek of His bounty, so that you may \\ngive thanks.\\n13. He merges the night into the day, and He \\nmerges the day into the night; and He regu\\ufffelates the sun and the moon, each running for \\na stated term. Such is Allah, your Lord; His is \\nthe sovereignty. As for those you call upon \\nbesides Him, they do not possess a speck.\\n14. If you pray to them, they cannot hear your \\nprayer. And even if they heard, they would \\nnot answer you. And on the Day of Resurrec\\ufffetion, they will reject your partnership. None \\ninforms you like an Expert.\\n15. O people! It is you who are the poor, in \\nneed of Allah; while Allah is the Rich, the \\nPraiseworthy.\\n16. If He wills, He can do away with you, and \\nproduce a new creation.\\n17. And that would not be difficult for Allah.\\n18. No burdened soul can carry the burden of \\nanother. Even if one weighted down calls for \\nhelp with its burden, nothing can be lifted \\nfrom it, even if they were related. You are to \\nwarn those who fear their Lord inwardly, and \\nperform the prayer. He who purifies himself \\npurifies himself for his own good. To Allah is \\nthe ultimate return.\\n19. Not equal are the blind and the seeing.\\n20. Nor are the darkness and the light.\\n21. Nor are the shade and the torrid heat. \\n22. Nor are equal the living and the dead. Allah \\ncauses whomever He wills to hear, but you \\ncannot make those in the graves hear.\\n23. You are only a warner.\\n24. We sent you with the truth; a bearer of \\ngood news, and a warner. There is no com\\ufffemunity but a warner has passed through it.\\n25. If they disbelieve you, those before them \\nalso disbelieved. Their messengers came to \\nthem with the clear proofs, with the Psalms, \\nand with the Enlightening Scripture.\\n26. Then I seized those who disbelieved—so \\nhow was My rejection?\\n27. Have you not seen that Allah sends down \\nwater from the sky? With it We produce \\nfruits of various colors. And in the mountains \\nare streaks of white and red—varying in their \\nhue—and pitch-black. \\n28. Likewise, human beings, animals, and live\\ufffestock come in various colors. From among \\nHis servants, the learned fear Allah. Allah is \\nAlmighty, Oft-Forgiving.\\n29. Those who recite the Book of Allah, and \\nperform the prayer, and spend of what We \\n164\\n36. YA-SEEN (Ya-Seen)\\nhave provided for them, secretly and pub\\ufffelicly, expect a trade that will not fail.\\n30. He will pay them their dues in full, and will \\nincrease them from His bounty. He is Forgiv\\ufffeing and Appreciative.\\n31. What We inspired in you, of the Book, is \\nthe truth, confirming what preceded it. Allah \\nis Well-Informed of His servants, All-Seeing.\\n32. Then We passed the Book to those of Our \\nservants whom We chose. Some of them \\nwrong their souls, and some follow a middle \\ncourse, and some are in the foremost in good \\ndeeds by Allah’s leave; that is the greatest \\nblessing.\\n33. The Gardens of Eden, which they will en\\ufffeter. They will be adorned therein with gold \\nbracelets and pearls, and their garments \\ntherein will be of silk.\\n34. And they will say, “Praise Allah, who has \\nlifted all sorrow from us. Our Lord is Most \\nForgiving, Most Appreciative.\\n35. He Who settled us in the Home of Perma\\ufffenence, by His grace, where boredom will not \\ntouch us, and fatigue will not afflict us.”\\n36. As for those who disbelieve, for them is the \\nFire of Hell, wherein they will never be fin\\ufffeished off and die, nor will its punishment be \\nlightened for them. Thus We will repay every \\ningrate.\\n37. And they will scream therein, “Our Lord, \\nlet us out, and we will act righteously, differ\\ufffeently from the way we used to act.” Did We \\nnot give you a life long enough, in which an\\ufffeyone who wanted to understand would have \\nunderstood? And the warner did come to \\nyou. So taste. The evildoers will have no \\nhelper.\\n38. Allah is the Knower of the future of the \\nheavens and the earth. He knows what the \\nhearts contain.\\n39. It is He who made you successors on earth. \\nWhoever disbelieves, his disbelief will recoil \\nupon him. The disbelief of the disbelievers \\nadds only to their Lord's disfavor of them. \\nThe disbelief of the disbelievers adds only to \\ntheir perdition.\\n40. Say, “Have you considered those partners \\nof yours that you worship instead of Allah? \\nShow me what they have created on earth. Or \\ndo they have any share in the heavens?” Or \\nhave We given them a book whose clear \\nteachings they follow? In fact, the wrongdo\\ufffeers promise one another nothing but delu\\ufffesions.\\n41. Allah holds the heavens and the earth, lest \\nthey fall apart. And were they to fall apart, \\nthere is none to hold them together except \\nHe. He is Most Clement, Most Forgiving.\\n42. And they swore by Allah with their solemn \\noaths, that if a warner came to them, they \\nwould be more guided than any other people. \\nYet when a warner came to them, it only in\\ufffecreased them in aversion.\\n43. Priding themselves on earth, and scheming \\nevil. But evil scheming overwhelms none but \\nits authors. Do they expect anything but the \\nprecedent of the ancients? You will not find \\nany change in Allah’s practice, and you will \\nnot find any substitute to Allah’s practice.\\n44. Have they not journeyed in the land and \\nobserved the fate of those who preceded \\nthem? They were superior to them in \\nstrength. But nothing can defeat Allah in the \\nheavens or on Earth. He is indeed Omnisci\\ufffeent and Omnipotent.\\n45. If Allah were to punish the people for what \\nthey have earned, He would not leave a single \\nliving creature on its surface. But He defers \\nthem until a stated time. Then, when their \\ntime has arrived—Allah is Observant of His \\ncreatures.\\n36. YA-SEEN\\n(Ya-Seen)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Ya, Seen.\\n2. By the Wise Quran.\\n165\\n36. YA-SEEN (Ya-Seen)\\n3. You are one of the messengers.\\n4. On a straight path.\\n5. The revelation of the Almighty, the Merci\\ufffeful.\\n6. To warn a people whose ancestors were not \\nwarned, and so they are unaware.\\n7. The Word was realized against most of \\nthem, for they do not believe.\\n8. We placed shackles around their necks, up \\nto their chins, so they are stiff-necked.\\n9. And We placed a barrier in front of them, \\nand a barrier behind them, and We have en\\ufffeshrouded them, so they cannot see.\\n10. It is the same for them, whether you warn \\nthem, or do not warn them—they will not be\\ufffelieve.\\n11. You warn only him who follows the Mes\\ufffesage, and fears the Most Gracious inwardly. \\nSo give him good news of forgiveness, and a \\ngenerous reward.\\n12. It is We who revive the dead; and We write \\ndown what they have forwarded, and their \\ntraces. We have tallied all things in a Clear \\nRecord.\\n13. And cite for them the parable of the land\\ufffelords of the town—when the messengers \\ncame to it.\\n14. We sent them two messengers, but they de\\ufffenied them both, so We reinforced them with \\na third. They said, “We are messengers to \\nyou.”\\n15. They said, “You are nothing but humans \\nlike us, and the Gracious did not send down \\nanything; you are only lying.”\\n16. They said, “Our Lord knows that we are \\nmessengers to you. \\n17. And our only duty is clear communica\\ufffetion.”\\n18. They said, “We see an evil omen in you; if \\nyou do not give up, we will stone you, and a \\npainful punishment from us will befall you.”\\n19. They said, “Your evil omen is upon you. Is \\nit because you were reminded? But you are an \\nextravagant people.”\\n20. Then a man came running from the remot\\ufffeest part of the city. He said, “O my people, \\nfollow the messengers.\\n21. Follow those who ask you of no wage, and \\nare themselves guided.\\n22. “And why should I not worship Him Who \\ncreated me, and to Whom you will be re\\ufffeturned?\\n23. Shall I take other gods instead of Him? If \\nthe Merciful desires harm for me, their inter\\ufffecession will not avail me at all, nor will they \\nsave me.\\n24. In that case, I would be completely lost. \\n25. I have believed in your Lord, so listen to \\nme.”\\n26. It was said, “Enter Paradise.” He said, “If \\nonly my people knew.\\n27. How my Lord has forgiven me, and made \\nme one of the honored.”\\n28. After him, We sent down no hosts from \\nheaven to his people; nor would We ever send \\nany down.\\n29. It was just one Cry, and they were stilled.\\n30. Alas for the servants. No messenger ever \\ncame to them, but they ridiculed him.\\n31. Have they not considered how many gen\\ufffeerations We destroyed before them; and that \\nunto them they will not return?\\n32. All of them, every single one of them, will \\nbe arraigned before Us.\\n33. And there is a sign for them in the dead \\nland: We give it life, and produce from it \\ngrains from which they eat.\\n34. And We place in it gardens of palm-trees \\nand vines, and cause springs to gush out of it.\\n35. That they may eat from its fruits, although\\ntheir hands did not make it. Will they not be \\nappreciative?\\n166\\n36. YA-SEEN (Ya-Seen)\\n36. Glory be to Him who created all the pairs; \\nof what the earth produces, and of their own \\nselves, and of what they do not know.\\n37. Another sign for them is the night: We \\nstrip the day out of it—and they are in dark\\ufffeness.\\n38. And the sun runs towards its destination. \\nSuch is the design of the Almighty, the All\\ufffeKnowing.\\n39. And the moon: We have disposed it in \\nphases, until it returns like the old twig.\\n40. The sun is not to overtake the moon, nor is \\nthe night to outpace the day. Each floats in an \\norbit.\\n41. Another sign for them is that We carried \\ntheir offspring in the laden Ark.\\n42. And We created for them the like of it, in \\nwhich they ride.\\n43. If We will, We can drown them—with no \\nscreaming to be heard from them, nor will \\nthey be saved.\\n44. Except by a mercy from Us, and enjoyment \\nfor a while.\\n45. Yet when it is said to them, “Beware of \\nwhat lies before you, and what lies behind \\nyou, that you may receive mercy.”\\n46. Yet never came to them a sign of their \\nLord’s signs, but they turned away from it.\\n47. And when it is said to them, “Spend of \\nwhat Allah has provided for you,” those who \\ndisbelieve say to those who believe, “Shall we \\nfeed someone whom Allah could feed, if He \\nso willed? You must be deeply misguided.”\\n48. And they say, “When will this promise be, \\nif you are truthful?”\\n49. All they can expect is a single blast, which \\nwill seize them while they feud.\\n50. They will not be able to make a will, nor \\nwill they return to their families.\\n51. The Trumpet will be blown, then behold, \\nthey will rush from the tombs to their Lord.\\n52. They will say, “Woe to us! Who resurrected \\nus from our resting-place?” This is what the \\nMost Gracious had promised, and the mes\\ufffesengers have spoken the truth.”\\n53. It will be but a single scream; and behold, \\nthey will all be brought before Us.\\n54. On that Day, no soul will be wronged in the \\nleast, and you will be recompensed only for \\nwhat you used to do.\\n55. The inhabitants of Paradise, on that Day, \\nwill be happily busy.\\n56. They and their spouses, in shades, reclin\\ufffeing on couches.\\n57. They will have therein fruits. They will \\nhave whatever they call for.\\n58. Peace—a saying from a Most Merciful \\nLord.\\n59. But step aside today, you criminals.\\n60. Did I not covenant with you, O Children of \\nAdam, that you shall not serve the devil? That \\nhe is your sworn enemy?\\n61. And that you shall serve Me? This is a \\nstraight path.\\n62. He has misled a great multitude of you. Did \\nyou not understand?\\n63. This is Hellfire, which you were promised.\\n64. Roast in it today, because you persistently \\ndisbelieved.\\n65. On this Day, We will seal their mouths, and \\ntheir hands will speak to Us, and their feet \\nwill testify to everything they had done.\\n66. If We will, We can blind their eyes as they \\nrush towards the path—but how will they \\nsee?\\n67. And if We will, We can cripple them in \\ntheir place; so they can neither move forward, \\nnor go back.\\n68. Whomever We grant old age, We reverse \\nhis development. Do they not understand?\\n69. We did not teach him poetry, nor is it \\nproper for him. It is only a reminder, and a \\nClear Quran.\\n70. That he may warn whoever is alive, and \\nprove the Word against the faithless.\\n167\\n37. THE ALIGNERS (as-Saffat)\\n71. Have they not seen that We created for \\nthem, of Our Handiwork, livestock that they \\nown?\\n72. And We subdued them for them. Some \\nthey ride, and some they eat.\\n73. And they have in them other benefits, and \\ndrinks. Will they not give thanks?\\n74. Yet they have taken to themselves gods \\nother than Allah, that perhaps they may be \\nhelped.\\n75. They cannot help them, although they are \\narrayed as troops for them.\\n76. So let their words not sadden you. We \\nknow what they conceal, and what they re\\ufffeveal.\\n77. Does the human being not consider that \\nWe created him from a seed? Yet he becomes \\na fierce adversary.\\n78. And he produces arguments against Us, \\nand he forgets his own creation. He says, \\n“Who will revive the bones when they have \\ndecayed?”\\n79. Say, “He who initiated them in the first in\\ufffestance will revive them. He has knowledge of \\nevery creation.”\\n80. He who produced fuel for you from the \\ngreen trees, with which you kindle a fire.\\n81. Is not He who created the heavens and the \\nearth able to create the like of them? Cer\\ufffetainly. He is the Supreme All-Knowing Crea\\ufffetor.\\n82. His command, when He wills a thing, is to \\nsay to it, “Be,” and it comes to be.\\n83. So glory be to Him in whose hand is the \\ndominion of everything, and to Him you will \\nbe returned.\\n37. THE ALIGNERS\\n(as-Saffat)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. By the aligners aligning.\\n2. And the drivers driving.\\n3.And the reciters of the Reminder. \\n4. Your God is indeed One.\\n5. Lord of the heavens and the earth, and eve\\uffferything between them; and Lord of the Easts.\\n6. We have adorned the lower heaven with the \\nbeauty of the planets.\\n7. And guarded it against every defiant devil.\\n8. They cannot eavesdrop on the Supernal \\nElite, for they get bombarded from every side.\\n9. Repelled—they will have a lingering tor\\ufffement.\\n10. Except for him who snatches a fragment—\\nhe gets pursued by a piercing projectile.\\n11. Inquire of them,“Are they more difficult to \\ncreate, or the others We created?” We created \\nthem from sticky clay.\\n12. But you wonder, and they ridicule.\\n13. And when reminded, they pay no atten\\ufffetion.\\n14. And when they see a sign, they ridicule.\\n15. And they say, “This is nothing but plain \\nmagic.\\n16. When we have died and become dust and \\nbones, shall we be resurrected?\\n17. And our ancestors of old?”\\n18. Say, “Yes indeed, and you will be totally \\nsubdued.”\\n19. It will be a single nudge, and they will be \\nstaring.\\n20. They will say, “Woe to us. This is the Day \\nof Judgment.”\\n21. “This is the Day of Separation which you \\nused to deny.\\n22. Gather those who did wrong, and their ma\\ufffetes, and what they used to worship.\\n23. Besides Allah, and lead them to the way to \\nHell.\\n24. And stop them. They are to be questioned.”\\n25. What is the matter with you? Why do you \\nnot help one another?\\n168\\n37. THE ALIGNERS (as-Saffat)\\n26. In fact, on that Day, they will be submis\\ufffesive.\\n27. They will come to one another, question\\ufffeing one another.\\n28. They will say, “You used to come at us \\nfrom the right.”\\n29. They will say, “You yourselves were not be\\ufffelievers.\\n30. We had no authority over you. You your\\ufffeselves were rebellious people.\\n31. The Word of our Lord has been realized \\nagainst us. We are tasting it.\\n32. We seduced you. We were seducers.”\\n33. On that Day, they will share in the punish\\ufffement.\\n34. Thus We deal with the sinners.\\n35. When it was said to them, “There is no god \\nexcept Allah,” they grew arrogant.\\n36. And said, “Are we to abandon our gods for \\na mad poet?”\\n37. In fact, he came with the truth, and he con\\ufffefirmed the messengers.\\n38. Most assuredly, you will taste the painful \\npunishment.\\n39. And you will be repaid only for what you \\nused to do.\\n40. Except for Allah’s sincere servants. \\n41. For them is a known provision.\\n42. Fruits; and they will be honored.\\n43. In the Gardens of Bliss.\\n44. On furnishings, facing one another.\\n45. They will be offered a cup of pure drink.\\n46. White; a delight to those who drink.\\n47. Never polluted, and never intoxicating.\\n48. With them will be bashful women with \\nlovely eyes.\\n49. As if they were closely guarded pearls.\\n50. Then they will approach one another, \\nquestioning.\\n51. One of them will say, “I used to have a \\nfriend.\\n52. Who used to say, “Are you of those who \\nbelieve?\\n53. That after we die and become dust and\\nbones, we will be called to account?”\\n54. He will say, “Will you have a look?”\\n55. He will look, and will see him in the pit of \\nHell.\\n56. He will say, “By Allah, you almost ruined \\nme.\\n57. Were it not for the grace of my Lord, I \\nwould have been among the arraigned.”\\n58. “We will not die.\\n59. Except for our first death, and we will not \\nbe punished.”\\n60. This is the supreme triumph.\\n61. For the like of this let the workers work.\\n62. Is this a better hospitality, or the Tree of \\nBitterness?\\n63. We made it an ordeal for the unjust.\\n64. It is a tree that grows from the bottom of \\nHell.\\n65. Its fruits are like the devils’ heads.\\n66. They will eat from it, and fill their bellies \\nwith it.\\n67. Then, on top of it, they will have a brew of \\nboiling liquid.\\n68. Then their return will be to the Blaze.\\n69. They had found their parents astray.\\n70. And rushed along in their footsteps.\\n71. And most of the ancients before them went \\nastray.\\n72. Even though We sent messengers to warn \\nthem.\\n73. So observe the end of those who were\\nwarned.\\n74. Except for the sincere servants of Allah.\\n75. And Noah called out to Us, and We are the \\nBest of responders.\\n169\\n37. THE ALIGNERS (as-Saffat)\\n76. And We saved him and his family from the \\ngreat calamity.\\n77. And We made his descendants the survi\\ufffevors.\\n78. And We left mention of him among those \\nwho succeeded.\\n79. Peace be upon Noah among all people.\\n80. We thus reward the righteous.\\n81. He was one of Our believing servants.\\n82. Then We drowned the others.\\n83. Of his kind was Abraham.\\n84. When he came to his Lord with a sound \\nheart.\\n85. He said to his father and his people, “What \\nare you worshiping?\\n86. Is it falsified gods, instead of Allah, that you \\nwant?\\n87. So what is your opinion about the Lord of \\nthe Worlds?”\\n88. Then he took a glance at the stars.\\n89. And said, “I am sick.”\\n90. But they turned their backs on him, and \\nwent away. \\n91. Then he turned to their gods, and said, \\n“will you not eat?\\n92. What is it with you, that you do not speak?”\\n93. Then he turned on them, striking with his \\nright hand.\\n94. And they came running towards him. \\n95. He said, “Do you worship what you carve?\\n96. When Allah created you, and what you \\nmanufacture?”\\n97. They said, “Build a pyre for him, and throw \\nhim into the furnace.”\\n98. They wished him ill, but We made them \\nthe losers.\\n99. He said, “I am going towards my Lord, and \\nHe will guide me.”\\n100. “My Lord, give me one of the righteous.”\\n101. So We gave him good news of a clement \\nboy.\\n102. Then, when he was old enough to accom\\ufffepany him, he said, “O My son, I see in a \\ndream that I am sacrificing you; see what you \\nthink.” He said, “O my Father, do as you are \\ncommanded; you will find me, Allah willing, \\none of the steadfast.”\\n103. Then, when they had submitted, and he \\nput his forehead down.\\n104. We called out to him, “O Abraham!\\n105. You have fulfilled the vision.” Thus We re\\ufffeward the doers of good.\\n106. This was certainly an evident test.\\n107. And We redeemed him with a great sacri\\ufffefice.\\n108. And We left with him for later genera\\ufffetions.\\n109. Peace be upon Abraham.\\n110. Thus We reward the doers of good.\\n111. He was one of Our believing servants.\\n112. And We gave him good news of Isaac, a \\nprophet, one of the righteous.\\n113. And We blessed him, and Isaac. But \\namong their descendants are some who are \\nrighteous, and some who are clearly unjust to \\nthemselves.\\n114. And We blessed Moses and Aaron.\\n115. And We delivered them and their people \\nfrom the terrible disaster.\\n116. And We supported them, and so they were \\nthe victors.\\n117. And We gave them the Clarifying Scrip\\ufffeture.\\n118. And We guided them upon the straight \\npath.\\n119. And We left with them for later genera\\ufffetions.\\n120. Peace be upon Moses and Aaron.\\n121. Thus We reward the righteous.\\n122. They were of Our believing servants.\\n170\\n37. THE ALIGNERS (as-Saffat)\\n123. Also Elijah was one of the messengers.\\n124. He said to his people, “Do you not fear?\\n125. Do you call on Baal, and forsake the Best \\nof creators?\\n126. Allah is your Lord, and the Lord of your \\nancestors.”\\n127. But they called him a liar, and thus they \\nwill be brought forward.\\n128. Except for Allah’s sincere servants.\\n129. And We left with him for later genera\\ufffetions.\\n130. Peace be upon the House of Elijah.\\n131. Thus We reward the virtuous.\\n132. He was one of Our believing servants.\\n133. And Lot was one of the messengers.\\n134. We saved him and his family, all of them.\\n135. Except for an old woman who lagged be\\ufffehind.\\n136. Then We annihilated the others.\\n137. You pass by them in the morning.\\n138. And at night. Do you not understand?\\n139. And Jonah was one of the messengers.\\n140. When he fled to the laden boat.\\n141. He gambled and lost.\\n142. Then the fish swallowed him, and he was \\nto blame.\\n143. Had he not been one of those who praised.\\n144. He would have stayed in its belly until the \\nDay they are raised.\\n145. Then We threw him into the wilderness, \\nand he was sick.\\n146. And We made a gourd tree grow over him.\\n147. Then We sent him to a hundred thousand, \\nor more.\\n148. And they believed, so We gave them en\\ufffejoyment for a while.\\n149. Ask them, “Are the daughters for your \\nLord, while for them the sons?”\\n150. Or did We create the angels females, as \\nthey witnessed?”\\n151. No indeed! It is one of their lies when they \\nsay.\\n152. “Allah has begotten.” They are indeed ly\\ufffeing.\\n153. So He preferred girls over boys?\\n154. What is the matter with you? How do you \\njudge?\\n155. Will you not reflect?\\n156. Or do you have some clear proof?\\n157. Then bring your book, if you are telling \\nthe truth.\\n158. And they invented a relationship between \\nHim and the jinn. But the jinn know that they \\nwill be arraigned.\\n159. Allah be glorified, far above what they al\\ufffelege.\\n160. Except for Allah’s sincere servants.\\n161. Surely, you and what you serve.\\n162. Cannot seduce away from Him.\\n163. Except for he who will be roasting in Hell.\\n164. “There is not one of us but has an assigned \\nposition.\\n165. And we are the arrangers.\\n166. And we are the glorifiers.”\\n167. Even though they used to say.\\n168. “Had we received advice from the an\\ufffecients.\\n169. We would have been Allah's faithful serv\\ufffeants.”\\n170. But they rejected it, so they will find out.\\n171. Our Word has already gone out to our \\nservant messengers.\\n172. It is they who will be supported.\\n173. And Our troops will be the victors.\\n174. So disregard them for a while.\\n175. And watch them—they will soon see.\\n176. Are they seeking to hasten Our punish\\ufffement?\\n171\\n38. SAAD (Saad)\\n177. When it descends into their yard, misera\\ufffeble will be the morning of those forewarned.\\n178. So avoid them for a while.\\n179. And watch—they will soon see.\\n180. Exalted be your Lord, the Lord of Glory, \\nbeyond their allegations.\\n181. And peace be upon the messengers.\\n182. And praise be to Allah, the Lord of the \\nWorlds.\\n38. SAAD\\n(Saad)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Saad. By the renowned Quran.\\n2. Those who disbelieve are steeped in arro\\ufffegance and defiance.\\n3. How many generations have We destroyed \\nbefore them? They cried out when it was too \\nlate to escape.\\n4. And they marveled that a warner has come \\nto them from among them. The disbelievers \\nsaid, “This is a lying magician.”\\n5. “Did he turn all the gods into one God? This \\nis something strange.”\\n6. The notables among them announced: “Go \\non, and hold fast to your gods. This is some\\ufffething planned.\\n7. We never heard of this in the former faith. \\nThis is nothing but a fabrication.\\n8. Was the message sent down to him, out of \\nall of us?” In fact, they are doubtful of My \\nwarning. In fact, they have not yet tasted My \\npunishment.\\n9. Or do they possess the treasuries of the \\nmercy of your Lord—the Majestic, the Giver?\\n10. Or do they possess the sovereignty of the \\nheavens and the earth and what is between \\nthem? Then let them ascend the ropes.\\n11. An army of confederates will be defeated \\nthere.\\n12. Before them the people of Noah denied the \\ntruth; as did Aad, and Pharaoh of the Stakes.\\n13. And Thamood, and the people of Lot, and \\nthe dwellers of the Woods—these were the \\nconfederates.\\n14. None of them but denied the messengers, \\nso My retribution was deserved.\\n15. These can expect only a single scream, \\nfrom which there is no recovery.\\n16. And they say, “Our Lord, hasten Your writ \\nupon us, before the Day of Account.”\\n17. Be patient in the face of what they say, and \\nmention Our servant David, the resourceful. \\nHe was obedient.\\n18. We committed the mountains to glorify \\nwith him, in the evening and at daybreak.\\n19. And the birds, gathered together. All obe\\ufffedient to him. \\n20. And We strengthened his kingdom, and \\ngave him wisdom and decisive speech.\\n21. Has the story of the two disputants reached \\nyou? When they scaled the sanctuary?\\n22. When they entered upon David, and he \\nwas startled by them. They said, “Do not fear. \\nTwo disputants; one of us has wronged the \\nother; so judge between us fairly, and do not \\nbe biased, and guide us to the straight way.”\\n23. “This brother of mine has ninety nine \\newes, and I have one ewe, and he said, ‘En\\ufffetrust it to me,’ and he pressured me with \\nwords.”\\n24. He said, “He has done you wrong by asking \\nyour ewe in addition to his ewes. Many part\\ufffeners take advantage of one another, except \\nthose who believe and do good deeds, but \\nthese are so few.” David realized that We \\nwere testing him, so he sought forgiveness \\nfrom his Lord, and fell down to his knees, and \\nrepented.\\n25. So We forgave him that. And for him is \\nnearness to Us, and a good place of return.\\n26. “O David, We made you a ruler in the land, \\nso judge between the people with justice, and \\ndo not follow desire, lest it diverts you from \\n172\\n38. SAAD (Saad)\\nAllah’s path. Those who stray from Allah’s \\npath will have a painful punishment, for hav\\ufffeing ignored the Day of Account.”\\n27. We did not create the heaven and the earth \\nand everything between them in vain. That is \\nthe assumption of those who disbelieve—so \\nwoe to those who disbelieve because of the \\nFire.\\n28. Or are We to treat those who believe and \\ndo righteous deeds like those who make trou\\ufffeble on earth? Or are We to treat the pious like \\nthe shameless?\\n29. A blessed Book that We sent down to you, \\nthat they may ponder its Verses, and for those \\nwith intelligence to take heed.\\n30. And We granted David, Solomon, an ex\\ufffecellent servant. He was penitent.\\n31. When the beautiful horses were paraded \\nbefore him in the evening.\\n32. He said, “I have preferred the love of nice\\ufffeties to the remembrance of my Lord—until it \\ndisappeared behind the veil.\\n33. Bring them back to me.” And he began ca\\uffferessing their legs and necks.\\n34. We tested Solomon, and placed a body on \\nhis throne; then he repented.\\n35. He said, “My Lord, forgive me, and grant \\nme a kingdom never to be attained by anyone \\nafter me. You are the Giver.”\\n36. So We placed the wind at his service, blow\\ufffeing gently by his command, wherever he di\\uffferected.\\n37. And the demons—every builder and diver.\\n38. And others fettered in chains.\\n39. “This is Our gift; so give generously, or \\nwithhold; without account.”\\n40. For him is nearness to Us, and a beautiful \\nresort.\\n41. And mention Our servant Job, when he \\ncalled out to his Lord, “Satan has afflicted me \\nwith hardship and pain.”\\n42. “Stamp with your foot—here is cool water \\nto wash with, and to drink.”\\n43. And We restored his family for him, and \\ntheir like with them; as a mercy from Us, and \\na lesson for those who possess insight.\\n44. “Take with your hand a bundle, and strike \\nwith it, and do not break your oath.” We \\nfound him patient. What an excellent serv\\ufffeant! He was obedient.\\n45. And mention Our servants Abraham, \\nIsaac, and Jacob—endowed with ability and \\nvision.\\n46. We distinguished them with a distinct \\nquality: the remembrance of the Home.\\n47. To Us they are among the chosen, the out\\ufffestanding.\\n48. And mention Ishmael, Elisha, and Ezekiel; \\nall are among the outstanding.\\n49. This is a reminder. The devout will have a \\ngood place of return.\\n50. The Gardens of Eden, with their doors \\nwide-open for them.\\n51. Relaxing therein, and calling for abundant \\nfruit and beverage.\\n52. With them will be attendants with modest \\ngaze, of same age.\\n53. This is what you are promised for the Day \\nof Account.\\n54. Such is Our bounty, inexhaustible. \\n55. All This. But the transgressors will have a \\nmiserable return.\\n56. Hell; in which they will roast; what a mis\\ufffeerable abode!\\n57. All this. Let them taste it—boiling and bit\\ufffeter cold.\\n58. And similar torments of diverse kinds.\\n59. “This is a crowd rushing headlong with \\nyou.” There is no welcome for them. They \\nwill be scorched by the Fire.\\n60. They will say, “But it is you! There is no \\nwelcome for you! It is you who brought it \\nupon us! What a miserable end!”\\n61. They will say, “Our Lord, whoever brought \\nthis upon us, give him double torment in the \\nFire.”\\n173\\n39. THRONGS (az-Zumar)\\n62. And they will say, “What is it with us that \\nwe do not see men we used to count among \\nthe wicked?\\n63. Did we take them for mockery, or have our \\neyes swerved from them?\\n64. This is certainly true—the feuding of the \\npeople of the Fire.\\n65. Say, “I am only a warner, and there is no \\ngod except Allah—the One, the Conqueror.\\n66. The Lord of the heavens and the earth, and \\neverything between them; the Mighty, the \\nForgiver.”\\n67. Say, “It is a message of great importance.\\n68. From which you are turning away.\\n69. I have no knowledge of the Highest Assem\\ufffebly as they dispute.\\n70. It is only revealed to me that I am a clear \\nwarner.”\\n71. Your Lord said to the angels, “I am creating \\na human being from clay.\\n72. When I have formed him, and breathed \\ninto him of My spirit, fall prostrate before \\nhim.\\n73. So the angels fell prostrate, all of them.\\n74. Except for Satan. He was too proud, and \\none of the faithless.\\n75. He said, “O Satan, what prevented you \\nfrom prostrating before what I created with \\nMy Own hands? Are you too proud, or were \\nyou one of the exalted?”\\n76. He said, “I am better than he; You created \\nme from fire, and You created him from \\nclay.”\\n77. He said, “Then get out of here! You are an \\noutcast!\\n78. And My curse will be upon you until the \\nDay of Judgment.”\\n79. He said, “Lord, defer me until the Day they \\nare resurrected.”\\n80. He said, “You are one of those deferred.\\n81. Until the Day of the Time Appointed.”\\n82. He said, “By Your majesty, I will seduce \\nthem all.\\n83. Except for your loyal servants among \\nthem.”\\n84. He said, “The truth is, and I say the truth.\\n85. I will fill Hell with you, and with every one \\nof them who follows you.”\\n86. Say, “I ask of you no wage for this, and I am \\nnot a pretender.\\n87. It is but a reminder to mankind.\\n88. And you will know its message after a \\nwhile.”\\n39. THRONGS\\n(az-Zumar)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. The revelation of the Book is from Allah, the \\nMighty and Wise.\\n2. We sent down to you the Book with the \\ntruth, so serve Allah, devoting your religion \\nto Him.\\n3. Is not to Allah that sincere faith is due? As \\nfor those who take guardians besides Him, \\n“We only worship them that they may bring \\nus nearer to Allah.” Allah will judge between \\nthem regarding their differences. Allah does \\nnot guide the lying blasphemer.\\n4. If Allah wanted to have a son, He could have \\nselected from His creation at will. Glory be to \\nHim. He is Allah, the One, the Prevailing.\\n5. He created the heavens and the earth with \\nreason. He wraps the night around the day, \\nand He wraps the day around the night. And \\nHe regulates the sun and the moon, each run\\ufffening along a specific course. He is indeed the \\nAlmighty, the Forgiver.\\n6. He created you from one person, then made \\nfrom it its mate, and brought down livestock \\nfor you—eight kinds in pairs. He creates you \\nin the wombs of your mothers, in successive \\n174\\n39. THRONGS (az-Zumar)\\nformations, in a triple darkness. Such is Al\\ufffelah, your Lord. His is the kingdom. There is \\nno god but He. So what made you deviate?\\n7. If you disbelieve, Allah is Independent of \\nyou, yet He does not approve ingratitude on \\nthe part of His servants. And if you are thank\\ufffeful, He will approve that in you. No bearer of \\nburden can bear the burden of another. Then \\nto your Lord is your return; and He will in\\ufffeform you of what you used to do. He is aware \\nof what the hearts contain.\\n8. When some adversity touches the human \\nbeing, he prays to his Lord, repenting to Him. \\nBut then, when He confers on him a grace of \\nHis, he forgets what he was praying for be\\ufffefore, and he attributes rivals to Allah, in order \\nto lead astray from His way. Say, “Enjoy your \\ndisbelief for a little while; you will be among \\nthe inmates of the Fire.”\\n9. Is he who worships devoutly during the \\nwatches of the night, prostrating himself and \\nstanding up, mindful of the Hereafter, and \\nplacing his hope in the mercy of his Lord? \\nSay, “Are those who know and those who do \\nnot know equal?” Only those possessed of \\nreason will remember.\\n10. Say, “O My devotees who have believed, \\nkeep your duty to your Lord. For those who \\ndo good in this world, is goodness. And Al\\ufffelah’s earth is vast. The steadfast will be paid \\ntheir wages in full, without reckoning.”\\n11. Say, “I was commanded to serve Allah, de\\ufffevoting my religion exclusively to Him.\\n12. And I was commanded to be the first of \\nthose who submit.”\\n13. Say, “I fear, if I disobeyed my Lord, the \\npunishment of a horrendous Day.”\\n14. Say, “It is Allah I worship, sincere in my \\nfaith in Him.”\\n15. “But you can worship whatever you wish \\nbesides Him.” Say, “The losers are those who \\nlose their souls and their people on the Day \\nof Resurrection.” That is indeed the obvious \\nloss.\\n16. They will have layers of Fire above them, \\nand layers beneath them. That is how Allah \\nstrikes fear into His servants—“O My serv\\ufffeants! Beware of Me!”\\n17. As for those who avoid the worship of \\nidols, and devote themselves to Allah—theirs \\nis the good news. So give good news to My \\nservants.\\n18. Those who listen to the Word, and follow \\nthe best of it. These are they whom Allah has \\nguided. These are they who possess intellect.\\n19. What about someone who has deserved the \\nsentence of punishment? Is it you who can \\nsave those in the Fire?\\n20. But those who fear their Lord will have \\nmansions upon mansions, built high, with \\nstreams flowing beneath them. The promise \\nof Allah; and Allah never breaks a promise.\\n21. Have you not considered how Allah sends \\ndown water from the sky, then He makes it \\nflow into underground wells, then He pro\\ufffeduces with it plants of various colors, then \\nthey wither and you see them yellowing, then \\nHe turns them into debris? Surely in this is a\\nreminder for those with understanding.\\n22. What about someone whose heart Allah \\nhas opened to Islam, so that he follows a light \\nfrom His Lord? Woe to those whose hearts \\nare hardened against the mention of Allah. \\nThose are in manifest error.\\n23. Allah has sent down the best of narrations: \\na Scripture consistent and paired. The skins \\nof those who reverence their Lord shiver \\nfrom it, then their skins and their hearts sof\\ufffeten up to the remembrance of Allah. Such is \\nAllah’s guidance; He guides with it whom\\ufffeever He wills. But whomever Allah leaves \\nastray, for him there is no guide.\\n24. What about someone who covers his face \\nagainst the terrible misery of the Day of Res\\ufffeurrection? To the evildoers it will be said, \\n“Taste what you used to earn.”\\n25. Those before them also denied the truth, so \\nthe penalty came upon them from where they \\ndid not perceive.\\n175\\n39. THRONGS (az-Zumar)\\n26. Allah made them taste disgrace in the pre\\ufffesent life, but the punishment of the Hereafter \\nis worse, if they only knew.\\n27. We have cited in this Quran for mankind \\nevery ideal, that they may take heed.\\n28. An Arabic Quran, without any defect, so \\nthey may become righteous.\\n29. Allah cites the example of a man shared by \\npartners at odds, and a man belonging exclu\\ufffesively to one man. Are they equal in status? \\nPraise be to Allah, but most of them do not \\nknow.\\n30. You will die, and they will die.\\n31. Then, on the Day of Resurrection, you will \\nbe quarrelling before your Lord.\\n32. Who is more evil than he who lies about \\nAllah, and denies the truth when it has come \\nto him? Is there not in Hell room for the un\\ufffegrateful?\\n33. But he who promotes the truth, and testi\\ufffefies to it—these are the righteous.\\n34. They will have whatever they please with \\ntheir Lord. Such is the reward for the virtu\\ufffeous.\\n35. Allah will acquit them of the worst of their \\ndeeds, and will reward them according to the \\nbest of what they used to do.\\n36. Is Allah not enough for His servant? And \\nthey frighten you with those besides Him. \\nWhomever Allah sends astray, for him there \\nis no guide.\\n37. And whomever Allah guides, for him there \\nis no misleader. Is Allah not Powerful and \\nVengeful?\\n38. And if you asked them, “Who created the \\nheavens and the earth?” they would say, “Al\\ufffelah.” Say, “Have you seen those you pray to \\ninstead of Allah? If Allah willed any harm for \\nme, can they lift His harm? And if He willed \\na blessing for me, can they hold back His \\nmercy?” Say, “Allah suffices for me. On Him \\nthe reliant rely.”\\n39. Say: “O my people, work according to your \\nability; and so will I. Then you will know.\\n40. Who will receive a humiliating punish\\ufffement, and on whom will fall a lasting tor\\ufffement.”\\n41. We sent down upon you the Book for man\\ufffekind in truth. He who follows guidance does \\nso for the good of his soul. And he who strays \\nin error does so to its detriment. You are not \\ntheir overseer.\\n42. Allah takes the souls at the time of their \\ndeath, and those that have not died during \\ntheir sleep. He retains those for which He has \\ndecreed death, and He releases the others un\\ufffetil a predetermined time. In that are signs for \\npeople who reflect.\\n43. Or have they chosen intercessors other \\nthan Allah? Say, “Even though they have no \\npower over anything, and are devoid of rea\\ufffeson?”\\n44. Say, “All intercession is up to Allah. To \\nHim belongs the kingdom of the heavens and \\nthe earth. Then to Him you will be returned.”\\n45. When Allah alone is mentioned, the hearts \\nof those who do not believe in the Hereafter \\nshrink with resentment. But when those \\nother than Him are mentioned, they become \\nfilled with joy.\\n46. Say, “Our God, Initiator of the heavens and \\nthe earth, Knower of all secrets and declara\\ufffetions. You will judge between your servants \\nregarding what they had differed about.”\\n47. If those who did wrong owned everything \\non earth, and the like of it with it, they would \\nredeem themselves with it from the terrible \\nsuffering on the Day of Resurrection. But \\nthere will appear to them from Allah what \\nthey never anticipated. \\n48. There will appear to them the evils of their \\ndeeds, and they will be surrounded by what \\nthey used to ridicule.\\n49. When adversity touches the human being, \\nhe calls on Us. But then, when We favor him \\nwith a blessing from Us, he says, “I have at\\ufffetained this by virtue of my knowledge.” How\\ufffeever, it is a test, but most of them do not \\nknow.\\n176\\n39. THRONGS (az-Zumar)\\n50. Those before them said it, but what they \\nhad earned did not avail them.\\n51. The evils of their deeds caught up with \\nthem. And the wrongdoers among these will \\nalso be afflicted by the evils of what they \\nearned, and they cannot prevent it.\\n52. Do they not know that Allah extends the \\nprovision to whomever He wills, and con\\ufffestricts it? In that are signs for people who be\\ufffelieve.\\n53. Say, “O My servants who have transgressed \\nagainst themselves: do not despair of Allah’s \\nmercy, for Allah forgives all sins. He is indeed \\nthe Forgiver, the Clement.”\\n54. And turn to your Lord, and submit to Him, \\nbefore the retribution comes upon you. Then \\nyou will not be helped.\\n55. And follow the best of what was revealed to \\nyou from your Lord, before the punishment \\ncomes upon you suddenly, while you are un\\ufffeaware.\\n56. So that a soul may not say, “How sorry I \\nam, for having neglected my duty to Allah, \\nand for having been of the scoffers.”\\n57. Or say, “Had Allah guided me; I would \\nhave been of the pious.”\\n58. Or say, when it sees the penalty, “If only I \\nhad another chance, I would be of the virtu\\ufffeous.”\\n59. Yes indeed! My Verses did come to you, \\nbut you called them lies, turned arrogant, and \\nwere of the faithless.\\n60. On the Day of Resurrection, you will see \\nthose who told lies about Allah with their \\nfaces blackened. Is there not a place in Hell \\nfor the arrogant?\\n61. And Allah will save those who maintained \\nrighteousness to their place of salvation. No \\nharm will touch them, nor will they grieve.\\n62. Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is \\nin Charge of all things.\\n63. To Him belong the reins of the heavens \\nand the earth. But those who blaspheme \\nagainst the revelations of Allah—it is they \\nwho are the losers.\\n64. Say, “Is it other than Allah you instruct me \\nto worship, you ignorant ones?”\\n65. It was revealed to you, and to those before \\nyou, that if you idolize, your works will be in \\nvain, and you will be of the losers.\\n66. Rather, worship Allah, and be of the appre\\ufffeciative.\\n67. They have not esteemed Allah as He ought \\nto be esteemed. The entire earth will be in His \\ngrip on the Day of Resurrection, and the\\nheavens will be folded in His right. Immacu\\ufffelate is He, and Transcendent He is beyond the \\nassociations they make. \\n68. And the Trumpet will be sounded, where\\ufffeupon everyone in the heavens and the earth \\nwill be stunned, except whomever Allah wills. \\nThen it will be sounded another time, where\\ufffeupon they will rise up, looking on.\\n69. And the earth will shine with the Light of \\nits Lord; and the Book will be put in place; \\nand the prophets and the witnesses will be \\nbrought in; and Judgment will be passed \\namong them equitably, and they will not be \\nwronged.\\n70. And every soul will be fully compensated \\nfor what it had done. He is well aware of what \\nthey do.\\n71. Those who disbelieved will be driven to \\nHell in throngs. Until, when they have \\nreached it, and its gates are opened, its keep\\ufffeers will say to them, “Did not messengers \\nfrom among you come to you, reciting to you \\nthe revelations of your Lord, and warning \\nyou of the meeting of this Day of yours?” \\nThey will say, “Yes, but the verdict of punish\\ufffement is justified against the disbelievers.”\\n72. It will be said, “Enter the gates of Hell, to \\nabide therein eternally.” How wretched is the \\ndestination of the arrogant.\\n73. And those who feared their Lord will be led \\nto Paradise in throngs. Until, when they have \\nreached it, and its gates are opened, its keep\\ufffeers will say to them, “Peace be upon you, you \\n177\\n40. FORGIVER (Ghafir)\\nhave been good, so enter it, to abide therein \\neternally.”\\n74. And they will say, “Praise be to Allah, who \\nhas fulfilled His promise to us, and made us \\ninherit the land, enjoying Paradise as we \\nplease.” How excellent is the reward of the \\nworkers.\\n75. And you will see the angels hovering \\naround the Throne, glorifying their Lord \\nwith praise. And it will be judged between \\nthem equitably, and it will be said, “Praise be \\nto Allah, Lord of the Worlds.”\\n40. FORGIVER\\n(Ghafir)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Ha, Meem.\\n2. The sending down of the Scripture is from \\nAllah the Almighty, the Omniscient.\\n3. Forgiver of sins, Accepter of repentance, Se\\ufffevere in punishment, Bountiful in bounty. \\nThere is no god but He. To Him is the ulti\\ufffemate return.\\n4. None argues against Allah’s revelations ex\\ufffecept those who disbelieve. So do not be im\\ufffepressed by their activities in the land.\\n5. Before them the people of Noah rejected the \\ntruth, as did the confederates after them. \\nEvery community plotted against their mes\\ufffesenger, to capture him. And they argued with \\nfalsehood, to defeat with it the truth. But I \\nseized them. What a punishment it was!\\n6. Thus the sentence of your Lord became re\\ufffealized against those who disbelieve, that they \\nare to be inmates of the Fire.\\n7. Those who carry the Throne, and those \\naround it, glorify their Lord with praise, and \\nbelieve in Him, and ask for forgiveness for \\nthose who believe: “Our Lord, You have en\\ufffecompassed everything in mercy and \\nknowledge; so forgive those who repent and \\nfollow Your path, and protect them from the \\nagony of the Blaze.\\n8. And admit them, Our Lord, into the Gar\\ufffedens of Eternity, which You have promised \\nthem, and the righteous among their parents, \\nand their spouses, and their offspring. You \\nare indeed the Almighty, the Most Wise.\\n9. And shield them from the evil deeds. \\nWhomever You shield from the evil deeds, \\non that Day, You have had mercy on him. \\nThat is the supreme achievement.”\\n10. Those who disbelieved will be addressed, \\n“The loathing of Allah is greater than your \\nloathing of yourselves—for you were invited \\nto the faith, but you refused.”\\n11. They will say, “Our Lord, you made us die \\ntwice, and twice you gave us life. Now we \\nacknowledge our sins. Is there any way out?”\\n12. That is because when Allah alone was \\ncalled upon, you disbelieved; but when others \\nwere associated with Him, you believed. \\nJudgment rests with Allah the Sublime, the \\nMajestic.\\n13. It is He who shows you His wonders, and \\nsends down sustenance from the sky for you. \\nBut none pays heed except the repentant.\\n14. So call upon Allah, with sincere devotion to \\nHim, even though the disbelievers resent it.\\n15. Exalted in rank, Owner of the Throne. He \\nconveys the Spirit, by His command, upon \\nwhomever He wills of His servants, to warn \\nof the Day of Encounter.\\n16. The Day when they will emerge, nothing \\nabout them will be concealed from Allah. “To \\nwhom does the sovereignty belong today?” \\n“To Allah, the One, the Irresistible.”\\n17. On that Day, every soul will be recom\\ufffepensed for what it had earned. There will be \\nno injustice on that Day. Allah is quick to set\\ufffetle accounts.\\n18. And warn them of the Day of Imminence, \\nwhen the hearts are at the throats, choking \\nthem. The evildoers will have no intimate \\nfriend, and no intercessor to be obeyed.\\n19. He knows the deceptions of the eyes, and \\nwhat the hearts conceal. \\n178\\n40. FORGIVER (Ghafir)\\n20. Allah judges with justice, while those \\nwhom they invoke besides Him cannot judge \\nwith anything. It is Allah who is the Hearing, \\nthe Seeing.\\n21. Have they not travelled through the earth, \\nand seen the consequences for those before \\nthem? They were stronger than them, and \\nthey left more impact on earth. But Allah \\nseized them for their sins, and they had no \\ndefender against Allah.\\n22. That is because their messengers used to \\ncome to them with clear proofs, but they dis\\ufffebelieved, so Allah seized them. He is Strong, \\nSevere in retribution.\\n23. We sent Moses with Our signs, and a clear \\nauthority.\\n24. To Pharaoh, Hamaan, and Quaroon. But \\nthey said, “A lying sorcerer.”\\n25. Then, when he came to them with the truth \\nfrom Us, they said, “Kill the sons of those \\nwho have believed with him, and spare their \\ndaughters.” But the scheming of the unbe\\ufffelievers can only go astray.\\n26. Pharaoh said, “Leave me to kill Moses, and \\nlet him appeal to his Lord. I fear he may \\nchange your religion, or spread disorder in \\nthe land.”\\n27. Moses said, “I have sought the protection \\nof my Lord and your Lord, from every tyrant \\nwho does not believe in the Day of Account.”\\n28. A believing man from Pharaoh's family, \\nwho had concealed his faith, said, “Are you \\ngoing to kill a man for saying, `My Lord is \\nAllah,’ and he has brought you clear proofs \\nfrom your Lord? If he is a liar, his lying will \\nrebound upon him; but if he is truthful, then \\nsome of what he promises you will befall you. \\nAllah does not guide the extravagant im\\ufffeposter.\\n29. O my people! Yours is the dominion today, \\nsupreme in the land; but who will help us \\nagainst Allah’s might, should it fall upon us?” \\nPharaoh said, “I do not show you except what \\nI see, and I do not guide you except to the \\npath of prudence.”\\n30. The one who had believed said, “O my peo\\ufffeple, I fear for you the like of the day of the \\nconfederates.\\n31. Like the fate of the people of Noah, and \\nAad, and Thamood, and those after them. Al\\ufffelah wants no injustice for the servants.\\n32. O my people, I fear for you the Day of Call\\ufffeing Out.\\n33. The Day when you will turn and flee, hav\\ufffeing no defender against Allah. Whomever Al\\ufffelah misguides has no guide.”\\n34. Joseph had come to you with clear revela\\ufffetions, but you continued to doubt what he \\ncame to you with. Until, when he perished, \\nyou said, “Allah will never send a messenger \\nafter him.” Thus Allah leads astray the outra\\ufffegeous skeptic.\\n35. Those who argue against Allah’s revela\\ufffetions, without any proof having come to \\nthem—a heinous sin in the sight of Allah, and \\nof those who believe. Thus Allah seals the \\nheart of every proud bully.\\n36. And Pharaoh said, “O Hamaan, build me a \\ntower, that I may reach the pathways.\\n37. The pathways of the heavens, so that I may \\nglance at the God of Moses; though I think he \\nis lying.” Thus Pharaoh’s evil deeds were \\nmade to appear good to him, and he was \\naverted from the path. Pharaoh's guile was \\nonly in defeat.\\n38. The one who had believed said,“O my peo\\ufffeple, follow me, and I will guide you to the \\npath of rectitude.”\\n39. “O my people, the life of this world is noth\\ufffeing but fleeting enjoyment, but the Hereafter \\nis the Home of Permanence.\\n40. Whoever commits a sin will be repaid only \\nwith its like. But whoever works righteous\\ufffeness, whether male or female, and is a be\\ufffeliever—these will enter Paradise, where they \\nwill be provided for without account.\\n41. O my people, how is it that I call you to sal\\ufffevation, and you call me to the Fire?\\n179\\n40. FORGIVER (Ghafir)\\n42. You call me to reject Allah, and to associate \\nwith Him what I have no knowledge of, while \\nI call you to the Mighty Forgiver.\\n43. Without a doubt, what you call me to has \\nno say in this world, or in the Hereafter; and \\nour turning back is to Allah; and the trans\\ufffegressors are the inmates of the Fire.\\n44. You will remember what I am telling you, \\nso I commit my case to Allah. Allah is Ob\\ufffeservant of the servants.”\\n45. So Allah protected him from the evils of \\ntheir scheming, while a terrible torment be\\ufffesieged Pharaoh’s clan.\\n46. The Fire. They will be exposed to it morn\\ufffeing and evening. And on the Day the Hour \\ntakes place: “Admit the clan of Pharaoh to the \\nmost intense agony.”\\n47. As they quarrel in the Fire, the weak will \\nsay to those who were arrogant, “We were \\nfollowers of yours; will you then spare us a \\nportion of the Fire?”\\n48. Those who were arrogant will say, “We are \\nall in it; Allah has judged between the serv\\ufffeants.”\\n49. And those in the Fire will say to the keepers \\nof Hell, “Call to your Lord to lessen our suf\\ufffefering for one day.”\\n50. They will say, “Did not your messengers \\ncome to you with clear signs?” They will say, \\n“Yes.” They will say, “Then pray, but the \\nprayers of the disbelievers will always be in \\nvain.”\\n51. Most surely We will support Our messen\\ufffegers and those who believe, in this life, and on \\nthe Day the witnesses arise.\\n52. The Day when their excuses will not profit \\nthe wrongdoers, and the curse will be upon \\nthem, and they will have the Home of Misery.\\n53. We gave Moses guidance, and made the \\nChildren of Israel inherit the Scripture.\\n54. A guide and a reminder for those endowed \\nwith reason.\\n55. So be patient. The promise of Allah is true. \\nAnd ask forgiveness for your sin, and pro\\ufffeclaim the praise of your Lord evening and \\nmorning.\\n56. Those who dispute regarding Allah’s reve\\ufffelations without any authority having come to \\nthem—there is nothing in their hearts but the \\nfeeling of greatness, which they will never at\\ufffetain. So seek refuge in Allah; for He is the All\\ufffeHearing, the All-Seeing.\\n57. Certainly the creation of the heavens and \\nthe earth is greater than the creation of hu\\ufffemanity, but most people do not know.\\n58. Not equal are the blind and the seeing. Nor \\nare those who believe and work righteousness \\nequal to the sinners. How little you reflect.\\n59. Indeed, the Hour is coming; there is no \\ndoubt about it; but most people do not be\\ufffelieve.\\n60. Your Lord has said, “Pray to Me, and I will \\nrespond to you. But those who are too proud \\nto worship Me will enter Hell forcibly.”\\n61. It is Allah Who made the night for you, that \\nyou may rest therein; and the day allowing \\nsight. Allah is gracious towards the people, \\nbut most people do not give thanks.\\n62. Such is Allah, your Lord, Creator of all \\nthings. There is no god except Him; so how \\ncould you turn away?\\n63. Thus are turned away those who dispute \\nthe signs of Allah.\\n64. It is Allah who made the earth a habitat for \\nyou, and the sky a structure. And He de\\ufffesigned you, and designed you well; and He \\nprovided you with the good things. Such is \\nAllah, your Lord; so Blessed is Allah, Lord of \\nthe Worlds.\\n65. He is the Living One. There is no god ex\\ufffecept He. So pray to Him, devoting your reli\\ufffegion to Him. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of \\nthe Worlds.\\n66. Say, “I was prohibited from worshiping \\nthose you invoke besides Allah, now that \\nclear revelations have come to me from my \\n180\\n41. DETAILED (Fussilat)\\nLord; and I was commanded to submit to the \\nLord of the Worlds.”\\n67. It is He who created you from dust, then \\nfrom a seed, then from an embryo, then He \\nbrings you out as an infant, then He lets you \\nreach your maturity, then you become el\\ufffederly—although some of you die sooner—so \\nthat you may reach a predetermined age, so \\nthat you may understand.\\n68. It is He who gives life and death; and when \\nHe decides on a thing, He just says to it, “Be,” \\nand it comes to be.\\n69. Have you not observed those who dispute \\nregarding Allah's revelations, how they have \\ndeviated?\\n70. Those who call the Book a lie, and what We \\nsent Our messengers with—they will surely \\nknow.\\n71. When the yokes are around their necks, \\nand they will be dragged by the chains.\\n72. Into the boiling water, then in the Fire they \\nwill be consumed.\\n73. Then it will be said to them, “Where are \\nthose you used to deify?\\n74. Instead of Allah?” They will say, “They \\nhave abandoned us. In fact, we were praying \\nto nothing before.” Thus Allah sends the dis\\ufffebelievers astray.\\n75. That is because you used to rejoice on earth \\nin other than the truth, and because you used \\nto behave with vanity.\\n76. Enter the gates of Hell, to remain therein \\nforever. What a terrible dwelling for the arro\\ufffegant.\\n77. So be patient. The promise of Allah is true. \\nWhether We show you some of what We \\nhave promised them, or take you to Us, to Us \\nthey will be returned.\\n78. We sent messengers before you. Some of \\nthem We told you about, and some We did \\nnot tell you about. No messenger can bring a \\nmiracle except by leave of Allah. Then, when \\nthe command of Allah is issued, fair judg\\ufffement will be passed, and there and then the \\nseekers of vanity will lose.\\n79. Allah is He who created the domestic ani\\ufffemals for you—some for you to ride, and some \\nyou eat.\\n80. And in them you have other benefits as \\nwell, and through them you satisfy your \\nneeds. And on them, and on the ships, you \\nare transported.\\n81. And He shows you His signs. So which of \\nAllah’s signs will you deny?\\n82. Have they not journeyed through the land, \\nand seen the outcome for those before them? \\nThey were more numerous than they, and \\nhad greater power and influence in the land. \\nBut what they had achieved availed them \\nnothing.\\n83. When their messengers came to them with \\nclear proofs, they rejoiced in the knowledge \\nthey had, and the very things they used to rid\\ufffeicule besieged them.\\n84. Then, when they witnessed Our might, \\nthey said, “We believe in Allah alone, and we \\nreject what we used to associate with Him.”\\n85. But their faith could not help them once \\nthey witnessed Our might. This has been Al\\ufffelah’s way of dealing with His servants. And \\nthere and then the disbelievers lost.\\n41. DETAILED\\n(Fussilat)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Ha, Meem.\\n2. A revelation from the Most Gracious, the \\nMost Merciful.\\n3. A Scripture whose Verses are detailed, a \\nQuran in Arabic for people who know.\\n4. Bringing good news, and giving warnings. \\nBut most of them turn away, so they do not \\nlisten.\\n5. And they say, “Our hearts are screened \\nfrom what you call us to, and in our ears is \\ndeafness, and between us and you is a barrier. \\nSo do what you want, and so will we.”\\n181\\n41. DETAILED (Fussilat)\\n6. Say, “I am only a human like you; it is in\\ufffespired in me that your God is One God. So be \\nupright towards Him, and seek forgiveness \\nfrom Him.” And woe to the idolaters.\\n7. Those who do not pay the alms; and regard\\ufffeing the Hereafter, they are disbelievers.\\n8. As for those who believe and do righteous \\ndeeds—for them is a reward uninterrupted.\\n9. Say, “Do you reject the One who created the \\nearth in two days? And you attribute equals \\nto Him? That is the Lord of the Universe.”\\n10. He placed stabilizers over it; and blessed it; \\nand planned its provisions in four days, \\nequally to the seekers.\\n11. Then He turned to the sky, and it was \\nsmoke, and said to it and to the earth, “Come, \\nwillingly or unwillingly.” They said, “We \\ncome willingly.”\\n12. So He completed them as seven universes \\nin two days, and He assigned to each universe \\nits laws. And We decorated the lower uni\\ufffeverse with lamps, and for protection. That is \\nthe design of the Almighty, the All-Knowing.\\n13. But if they turn away, say, “I have warned \\nyou of a thunderbolt, like the thunderbolt of \\nAad and Thamood.”\\n14. Their messengers came to them, from be\\ufffefore them and from behind them, saying, “Do \\nnot worship anyone but Allah.” They said, \\n“Had our Lord willed, He would have sent \\ndown angels; Therefore, we reject what you \\nare sent with.”\\n15. As for Aad, they turned arrogant on earth, \\nand opposed justice, and said, “Who is more \\npowerful than us?” Have they not considered \\nthat Allah, who created them, is more power\\ufffeful than they? And they went on denying Our \\nrevelations.\\n16. So We unleashed upon them a screaming \\nwind, for a few miserable days, to make them \\ntaste the punishment of shame in this life; but \\nthe punishment of the Hereafter is more \\nshameful; and they will not be saved.\\n17. And as for Thamood, We guided them, but \\nthey preferred blindness over guidance. So \\nthe thunderbolt of the humiliating punish\\ufffement seized them, because of what they used \\nto earn.\\n18. And We saved those who believed and \\nwere righteous.\\n19. The Day when Allah’s enemies are herded \\ninto the Fire, forcibly.\\n20. Until, when they have reached it, their \\nhearing, and their sight, and their skins will \\ntestify against them regarding what they used \\nto do.\\n21. And they will say to their skins, “Why did \\nyou testify against us?” They will say, “Allah, \\nWho made all things speak, made us speak. It \\nis He who created you the first time, and to \\nHim you are returned.”\\n22. You were unable to hide yourselves from \\nyour hearing, and your sight, and your skins, \\nto prevent them from testifying against you, \\nand you imagined that Allah was unaware of \\nmuch of what you do.\\n23. It is that thought of yours about your Lord \\nthat led you to ruin—so you became of the \\nlosers.\\n24. If they endure patiently, the Fire will be \\ntheir residence; and if they make up excuses, \\nthey will not be pardoned.\\n25. We had assigned companions for them, \\nwho glamorized to them what was in front of \\nthem, and what was behind them. And the \\nWord proved true against them in communi\\ufffeties of jinn and humans that have passed \\naway before them. They were losers.\\n26. Those who disbelieve say, “Do not listen to \\nthis Quran, and talk over it, so that you may \\nprevail.”\\n27. We will make those who disbelieve taste an \\nintense agony, and We will recompense them \\naccording to the worst of what they used to \\ndo.\\n28. Such is the recompense of Allah’s ene\\ufffemies—the Fire—where they will have their \\npermanent home, in recompense for having \\ndisregarded Our revelations.\\n182\\n41. DETAILED (Fussilat)\\n29. Those who disbelieved will say, “Our Lord, \\nshow us those who led us astray—among jinn \\nand humans—and we will trample them un\\ufffeder our feet, so they become of the lowest.”\\n30. Surely, those who say: “Our Lord is Allah,” \\nand then go straight, the angels will descend \\nupon them: “Do not fear, and do not grieve, \\nbut rejoice in the news of the Garden which \\nyou were promised.\\n31. We are your allies in this life and in the \\nHereafter, wherein you will have whatever \\nyour souls desire, and you will have therein \\nwhatever you call for.\\n32. As Hospitality from an All-Forgiving, \\nMerciful One.”\\n33. And who is better in speech than someone \\nwho calls to Allah, and acts with integrity, \\nand says, “I am of those who submit”?\\n34. Good and evil are not equal. Repel evil with \\ngood, and the person who was your enemy \\nbecomes like an intimate friend.\\n35. But none will attain it except those who \\npersevere, and none will attain it except the \\nvery fortunate.\\n36. When a temptation from the Devil pro\\ufffevokes you, seek refuge in Allah; He is the \\nHearer, the Knower.\\n37. And of His signs are the night and the day, \\nand the sun and the moon. Do not bow down \\nto the sun, nor to the moon, but bow down to \\nAllah, Who created them both, if it is Him \\nthat you serve.\\n38. But if they are too proud—those in the\\npresence of your Lord praise Him night and \\nday, and without ever tiring.\\n39. And of His signs is that you see the land \\nstill. But when We send down water upon it, \\nit stirs and grows. Surely, He Who revived it \\nwill revive the dead. He is Able to do all \\nthings.\\n40. Those who despise Our revelations are not \\nhidden from Us. Is he who is hurled into the \\nFire better? Or he who arrives safely on the \\nDay of Resurrection? Do as you please; He is \\nSeeing of everything you do.\\n41. Those who reject the Reminder when it has \\ncome to them—it is an invincible Book.\\n42. Falsehood cannot approach it, from before \\nit or behind it. It is a revelation from One \\nWise and Praiseworthy.\\n43. Nothing is said to you but was said to the \\nMessengers before you: your Lord is Posses\\ufffesor of Forgiveness, and Possessor of Painful \\nRepayment.\\n44. Had We made it a Quran in a foreign lan\\ufffeguage, they would have said, “If only its \\nverses were made clear.” Non-Arabic and an \\nArab? Say, “For those who believe, it is guid\\ufffeance and healing. But as for those who do not \\nbelieve: there is heaviness in their ears, and it \\nis blindness for them. These are being called \\nfrom a distant place.”\\n45. We gave Moses the Book, but disputes \\narose concerning it. Were it not for a prior \\ndecree from your Lord, judgment would have \\nbeen pronounced between them. But they are \\nin perplexing doubt concerning it.\\n46. Whoever acts righteously does so for him\\ufffeself; and whoever works evil does so against \\nhimself. Your Lord is not unjust to the serv\\ufffeants.\\n47. To Him is referred the knowledge of the \\nHour. No fruit emerges from its sheath, and \\nno female conceives or delivers, except with \\nHis knowledge. And on the Day when He\\ncalls out to them, “Where are My associates?” \\nThey will say, “We admit to you, none of us \\nis a witness.”\\n48. What they used to pray to before will for\\ufffesake them, and they will realize that they have \\nno escape.\\n49. The human being never tires of praying for\\ngood things; but when adversity afflicts him, \\nhe despairs and loses hope.\\n50. And when We let him taste a mercy from \\nUs, after the adversity that had afflicted him, \\nhe will say, “This is mine, and I do not think \\nthat the Hour is coming; and even if I am re\\ufffeturned to my Lord, I will have the very best \\n183\\n42. CONSULTATION (ash-Shura)\\nwith Him.” We will inform those who disbe\\ufffelieve of what they did, and We will make \\nthem taste an awful punishment.\\n51. When We provide comfort for the human \\nbeing, he withdraws and distances himself; \\nbut when adversity befalls him, he starts \\nlengthy prayers.\\n52. Say, “Have you considered? If it is from Al\\ufffelah and you reject it—who is further astray \\nthan he who is cutoff and alienated?”\\n53. We will show them Our proofs on the ho\\uffferizons, and in their very souls, until it be\\ufffecomes clear to them that it is the truth. Is it \\nnot sufficient that your Lord is witness over \\neverything?\\n54. Surely they are in doubt about the encoun\\ufffeter with their Lord. Surely He comprehends \\neverything.\\n42. CONSULTATION\\n(ash-Shura)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Ha, Meem.\\n2. Ayn, Seen, Qaf.\\n3. Thus He inspires you, and those before \\nyou—Allah the Almighty, the Wise.\\n4. To him belongs everything in the heavens \\nand everything on earth. He is the Sublime, \\nthe Magnificent.\\n5. The heavens above them almost burst apart, \\nwhile the angels glorify the praises of their \\nLord, and ask forgiveness for those on earth. \\nAllah is indeed the Forgiver, the Merciful.\\n6. As for those who take masters other than \\nHim: Allah is in charge of them, and you are \\nnot responsible for them.\\n7. Thus We inspired you with an Arabic \\nQuran, that you may warn the Central City \\nand whoever is around it, and to warn of the \\nDay of Assembly, of which there is no doubt; \\na group in the Garden, and a group in the \\nFurnace.\\n8. Had Allah willed, He could have made them \\none community, but He admits into His \\nmercy whomever He wills. As for the wrong\\ufffedoers, they will have no protector and no sav\\ufffeior.\\n9. Or have they adopted protectors besides \\nhim? But Allah is the Protector, and He gives \\nlife to the dead, and He has power over all \\nthings.\\n10. Whatever matter you differ about, its judg\\ufffement rests with Allah. “Such is Allah, my \\nLord, in Whom I trust, and unto Him I re\\ufffepent.”\\n11. Originator of the heavens and the earth. He \\nmade for you mates from among yourselves, \\nand pairs of animals, by means of which He \\nmultiplies you. There is nothing like Him. He \\nis the Hearing, the Seeing.\\n12. To Him belongs absolute control of the \\nheavens and the earth. He spreads the boun\\ufffeties to whomever He wills, or reduces it. He \\nis aware of all things.\\n13. He prescribed for you the same religion He \\nenjoined upon Noah, and what We inspired \\nto you, and what We enjoined upon Abra\\ufffeham, and Moses, and Jesus: “You shall up\\ufffehold the religion, and be not divided therein.” \\nAs for the idolaters, what you call them to is \\noutrageous to them. Allah chooses to Himself \\nwhom He wills, and He guides to Himself \\nwhoever repents.\\n14. They became divided only after knowledge \\ncame to them, out of resentment among \\nthemselves. Were it not for a predetermined \\ndecision from your Lord, judgment would \\nhave been pronounced between them. In\\ufffedeed, those who were made to inherit the \\nBook after them are in grave doubt about it.\\n15. To this go on inviting, and be upright as \\nyou were commanded, and do not follow \\ntheir inclinations, and say, “I believe in what\\ufffeever Book Allah has sent down, and I was \\ncommanded to judge between you equitably. \\nAllah is our Lord and your Lord. We have our \\ndeeds, and you have your deeds. Let there be \\nno quarrel between us and you. Allah will \\n184\\n42. CONSULTATION (ash-Shura)\\nbring us together, and to Him is the ultimate \\nreturn.”\\n16. As for those who dispute about Allah after \\nhaving answered His call, their argument is \\ninvalid with their Lord; and upon them falls \\nwrath; and a grievous torment awaits them.\\n17. It is Allah who revealed the Book with the \\ntruth, and the Balance. And what will make \\nyou realize that perhaps the Hour is near?\\n18. Those who do not believe in it seek to has\\ufffeten it; but those who believe are apprehensive \\nof it, and they know it to be the truth. Abso\\ufffelutely, those who question the Hour are in \\ndistant error.\\n19. Allah is kind towards His worshipers. He \\nprovides for whomever He wills. He is the \\nPowerful, the Honorable.\\n20. Whoever desires the harvest of the Hereaf\\ufffeter, We increase for him his harvest; and \\nwhoever desires the harvest of this world, We \\ngive him thereof, and he has no share of the \\nHereafter.\\n21. Or is it that they have partners who litigate \\nfor them religious laws never authorized by \\nAllah? Were it not for the conclusive deci\\ufffesion, it would have been settled between \\nthem. The wicked will have a painful punish\\ufffement.\\n22. You will see the unjust terrified of what \\nthey have earned, and it will befall them. As \\nfor those who believe and do good deeds, \\nthey will be in the Meadows of the Gardens; \\nthey will have whatever they please in the \\npresence of their Lord; that is the supreme \\nblessing.\\n23. That is the good news Allah gives to His \\nservants who believe and do good deeds. Say, \\n“I ask of you no wage for it, except affection \\namong the near of kin.” Whoever does a good \\ndeed, We will increase its goodness for him. \\nAllah is Forgiving and Appreciative.\\n24. Or do they say, “He forged a lie about Al\\ufffelah.” If Allah so willed, He could have sealed \\nyour heart. But Allah obliterates the false, and \\nconfirm the true by His Words. He knows \\nwhat is in the hearts.\\n25. It is He who accepts the repentance of His \\nworshipers, and remits the sins, and knows \\nwhat you do.\\n26. And He answers those who believe and do \\ngood deeds, and He increases them of His \\ngrace. But the disbelievers will suffer a terri\\ufffeble punishment.\\n27. If Allah were to increase the provision to \\nHis servants, they would transgress on earth; \\nbut He sends down in precise measure what\\ufffeever He wills. Surely, regarding His servants, \\nHe is Expert and Observant.\\n28. It is He who brings down the rain after they \\nhave despaired, and unfolds His mercy. He is \\nthe Guardian, the Praised.\\n29. And of His signs are the creation of the \\nheavens and the earth, and the creatures He \\nhas spread throughout them; and He is Able \\nto gather them at will.\\n30. Whatever misfortune befalls you, it is be\\ufffecause of what your hands have earned; and \\nyet He pardons much.\\n31. You are not the ones to interfere on earth; \\nand besides Allah, you have no ally, and no \\nhelper.\\n32. And of His signs are the ships sailing the \\nsea like flags.\\n33. If He willed, He could have stilled the \\nwinds, leaving them motionless on its sur\\ufffeface. Surely in that are signs for every disci\\ufffeplined, grateful person.\\n34. Or He could wreck them, because of what \\nthey have earned. And yet He pardons much.\\n35. Those who dispute Our signs know that \\nthere is no asylum for them.\\n36. Whatever thing you are given is only the \\nprovision of this life. But what Allah pos\\ufffesesses is better and more lasting for those \\nwho believe and rely on their Lord.\\n37. And those who avoid major sins and inde\\ufffecencies; and if they become angry, they for\\ufffegive.\\n38. And those who respond to their Lord, and \\npray regularly, and conduct their affairs by \\n185\\n43. DECORATIONS (az-Zukhruf)\\nmutual consultation, and give of what We \\nhave provided them.\\n39. And those who, when wronged, defend \\nthemselves. \\n40. The repayment of a bad action is one \\nequivalent to it. But whoever pardons and \\nmakes reconciliation, his reward lies with Al\\ufffelah. He does not love the unjust.\\n41. As for those who retaliate after being \\nwronged, there is no blame on them. \\n42. Blame lies on those who wrong people, and \\ncommit aggression in the land without right. \\nThese will have a painful punishment.\\n43. But whoever endures patiently and for\\ufffegives—that is a sign of real resolve.\\n44. Whoever Allah leaves astray has no protec\\ufffetor apart from Him. And you will see the \\ntransgressors, when they see the torment, \\nsaying, “Is there a way of going back?”\\n45. And you will see them exposed to it, cow\\ufffeering from disgrace, looking with concealed \\neyes. Those who believed will say, “The losers \\nare those who lost themselves and their fam\\ufffeilies on the Day of Resurrection.” Indeed, the \\nevildoers are in a lasting torment.\\n46. They will have no allies to support them \\nagainst Allah. Whomever Allah leaves astray \\nhas no way out.\\n47. Respond to your Lord before there comes \\nfrom Allah a Day that cannot be turned back. \\nYou will have no refuge on that Day, and no \\npossibility of denial.\\n48. But if they turn away—We did not send \\nyou as a guardian over them. Your only duty \\nis communication. Whenever We let man \\ntaste mercy from Us, he rejoices in it; but \\nwhen misfortune befalls them, as a conse\\ufffequence of what their hands have perpetrated, \\nman turns blasphemous.\\n49. To Allah belongs the dominion of the \\nheavens and the earth. He creates whatever \\nHe wills. He grants daughters to whomever \\nHe wills, and He grants sons to whomever He \\nwills.\\n50. Or He combines them together, males and \\nfemales; and He renders whomever He wills \\nsterile. He is Knowledgeable and Capable.\\n51. It is not for any human that Allah should \\nspeak to him, except by inspiration, or from \\nbehind a veil, or by sending a messenger to \\nreveal by His permission whatever He wills. \\nHe is All-High, All-Wise.\\n52. We thus inspired you spiritually, by Our \\ncommand. You did not know what the Scrip\\ufffeture is, nor what faith is, but We made it a \\nlight, with which We guide whomever We \\nwill of Our servants. You surely guide to a \\nstraight path.\\n53. The path of Allah, to whom belongs every\\ufffething in the heavens and everything on earth. \\nIndeed, to Allah all matters revert.\\n43. DECORATIONS\\n(az-Zukhruf)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Ha, Meem.\\n2. By the Book that makes things clear.\\n3. We made it an Arabic Quran, so that you \\nmay understand.\\n4. And it is with Us, in the Source Book, sub\\ufffelime and wise.\\n5. Shall We hold back the Reminder from you, \\nsince you are a transgressing people?\\n6. How many a prophet did We send to the \\nancients?\\n7. No messenger came to them, but they ridi\\ufffeculed him.\\n8. We destroyed people more powerful than \\nthey, and so the example of the ancients has \\npassed away.\\n9. And if you asked them, “Who created the \\nheavens and the earth?” They would say, \\n“The Mighty, the Knower created them.”\\n186\\n43. DECORATIONS (az-Zukhruf)\\n10. He who made the earth a habitat for you, \\nand traced pathways for you on it, that you \\nmay be guided.\\n11. He who sends down water from the sky in \\ndue proportion; and so We revive thereby a \\ndead land. Thus you will be brought out.\\n12. He Who created all the pairs; and provided \\nyou with ships, and animals on which you \\nride.\\n13. That you may mount their backs, and re\\ufffemember the favor of your Lord as you sit \\nfirmly upon them, and say, “Glory be to Him \\nWho placed these at our service; surely we \\ncould not have done it by ourselves.\\n14. And surely, to our Lord we will return.”\\n15. Yet they turn one of His servants into a part \\nof Him. Man is clearly ungrateful.\\n16. Or has He chosen for Himself daughters \\nfrom what He creates, and favored you with \\nsons?\\n17. Yet when one of them is given news of what \\nhe attributes to the Most Gracious, his face \\ndarkens, and he suppresses grief.\\n18. “Someone brought up to be beautiful, and \\nunable to help in a fight?”\\n19. And they appoint the angels, who are serv\\ufffeants to the Most Gracious, as females. Have \\nthey witnessed their creation? Their claim \\nwill be recorded, and they will be questioned.\\n20. And they say, “Had the Most Gracious \\nwilled, we would not have worshiped them.” \\nBut they have no knowledge of that; they are \\nmerely guessing.\\n21. Or have We given them a book prior to this \\none, to which they adhere?\\n22. But they say, “We found our parents on a \\ncourse, and we are guided in their footsteps.”\\n23. Likewise, We sent no warner before you to \\nany town, but the wealthy among them said, \\n“We found our parents on a course, and we \\nare following in their footsteps.”\\n24. He would say, “Even if I bring you better \\nguidance than what you found your parents \\nfollowing?” They would say, “We reject what \\nyou are sent with.”\\n25. So We wreaked vengeance upon them. Be\\ufffehold, then, what was the fate of those who \\ndeny.\\n26. When Abraham said to his father and his \\npeople, “I am innocent of what you worship.\\n27. Except for He who created me, for He will \\nguide me.”\\n28. And he made it an enduring word in his \\nprogeny, so that they may return.\\n29. I gave these and their forefathers some en\\ufffejoyment, until the truth and a manifest mes\\ufffesenger came to them.\\n30. But when the truth came to them, they \\nsaid, “This is sorcery, and we refuse to believe \\nin it.”\\n31. They also said, “If only this Quran was sent \\ndown to a man of importance from the two \\ncities.”\\n32. Is it they who allocate the mercy of your \\nLord? It is We who have allocated their live\\ufffelihood in this life, and We elevated some of \\nthem in rank above others, that some of them \\nwould take others in service. But your Lord’s \\nmercy is better than what they amass.\\n33. Were it not that humanity would become a \\nsingle community, We would have provided \\nthose who disbelieve in the Most Gracious \\nwith roofs of silver to their houses, and stair\\ufffeways by which they ascend.\\n34. And doors to their houses, and furnishings \\non which they recline.\\n35. And decorations. Yet all that is nothing but \\nthe stuff of this life. Yet the Hereafter, with \\nyour Lord, is for the righteous.\\n36. Whoever shuns the remembrance of the \\nMost Gracious, We assign for him a devil, to \\nbe his companion.\\n37. They hinder them from the path, though \\nthey think they are guided.\\n187\\n43. DECORATIONS (az-Zukhruf)\\n38. Until, when He comes to Us, he will say, “If \\nonly there were between me and you the dis\\ufffetance of the two Easts.” What an evil com\\ufffepanion!\\n39. It will not benefit you on that Day, since \\nyou did wrong. You are partners in the suf\\ufffefering.\\n40. Can you make the deaf hear, or guide the \\nblind, and him who is in evident error?\\n41. Even if We take you away, We will wreak \\nvengeance upon them.\\n42. Or show you what We have promised \\nthem; for We have absolute power over them.\\n43. So adhere to what is revealed to you. You \\nare upon a straight path.\\n44. It is a message for you, and for your people; \\nand you will be questioned.\\n45. Ask those of Our messengers We sent be\\ufffefore you: “Did We appoint gods besides the \\nMost Gracious to be worshiped?”\\n46. We sent Moses with Our revelations to \\nPharaoh and his dignitaries. He said, “I am \\nthe Messenger of the Lord of the Worlds.”\\n47. But when he showed them Our signs, they \\nstarted laughing at them.\\n48. Each sign We showed them was more mar\\ufffevelous than its counterpart. And We afflicted \\nthem with the plagues, so that they may re\\ufffepent.\\n49. They said, “O sorcerer, pray to your Lord \\nfor us, according to His pledge to you, and \\nthen we will be guided.”\\n50. But when We lifted the torment from \\nthem, they immediately broke their promise.\\n51. Pharaoh proclaimed among his people, \\nsaying, “O my people, do I not own the King\\ufffedom of Egypt, and these rivers flow beneath \\nme? Do you not see?\\n52. Am I not better than this miserable wretch, \\nwho can barely express himself?\\n53. Why are bracelets of gold not dropped on \\nhim, or they angels came with him in proces\\ufffesion?”\\n54. Thus he fooled his people, and they obeyed \\nhim. They were wicked people.\\n55. And when they provoked Our wrath, We \\ntook retribution from them, and We \\ndrowned them all.\\n56. Thus We made them a precedent and an \\nexample for the others.\\n57. And when the son of Mary was cited as an \\nexample, your people opposed.\\n58. They said, “Are our gods better, or he?” \\nThey cited him only for argument. In fact, \\nthey are a quarrelsome people.\\n59. He was just a servant whom We blessed, \\nand We made him an example for the Chil\\ufffedren of Israel.\\n60. Had We willed, We would have made of \\nyou angels to be successors on earth.\\n61. He is a portent of the Hour, so have no \\ndoubt about it, and follow Me. This is a \\nstraight way.\\n62. And let not Satan divert you. He is an open \\nenemy to you.\\n63. When Jesus came with the clarifications, he \\nsaid, “I have come to you with wisdom, and \\nto clarify for you some of what you differ \\nabout. So fear Allah, and obey me.\\n64. Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so wor\\ufffeship Him—this is a straight path.”\\n65. But the factions differed among them\\ufffeselves. So woe to the wrongdoers from the \\nsuffering of a painful Day.\\n66. Are they only waiting for the Hour to come \\nupon them suddenly, while they are una\\ufffeware?\\n67. On that Day, friends will be enemies of one \\nanother, except for the righteous.\\n68. O My servants, you have nothing to fear on \\nthat Day, nor will you grieve.\\n69. Those who believed in Our revelations, \\nand were submissive.\\n70. Enter the Garden, you and your spouses, \\nJoyfully.\\n188\\n44. SMOKE (ad-Dukhan)\\n71. They will be served around with trays of \\ngold, and cups. Therein is whatever the souls \\ndesire and delights the eyes. Therein you will \\nstay forever.\\n72. Such is the Garden you are made to inherit, \\nbecause of what you used to do.\\n73. Therein you will have abundant fruit, from \\nwhich you eat.\\n74. As for the sinners, they will be in the tor\\ufffement of Hell forever.\\n75. It will never be eased for them. In it, they \\nwill be devastated.\\n76. We did them no injustice, but it was they \\nwho were the unjust.\\n77. And they will cry, “O Malek, let your Lord \\nfinish us off.” He will say, “You are staying.”\\n78. We have given you the truth, but most of \\nyou hate the truth.\\n79. Have they contrived some scheme? We too \\nare contriving.\\n80. Or do they think that We cannot hear their \\nsecrets and their conspiracies? Yes indeed, \\nOur messengers are by them, writing down.\\n81. Say, “If the Most Gracious had a son, I \\nwould be the first to worship.”\\n82. Glorified be the Lord of the heavens and \\nthe earth, the Lord of the Throne, beyond \\nwhat they describe.\\n83. So leave them to blunder and play, until \\nthey encounter their Day which they are \\npromised.\\n84. It is He who is Allah in heaven, and Allah \\non earth. He is the Wise, the Knower.\\n85. And blessed is He Who has sovereignty \\nover the heavens and the earth and what is \\nbetween them. He alone has knowledge of the \\nHour, and to Him you will be returned.\\n86. Those they invoke besides Him are incapa\\ufffeble of intercession; only those who testify to \\nthe truth and have knowledge.\\n87. And if you asked them, “Who created \\nthem?”, they would say, “Allah.” Why then \\ndo they deviate?\\n88. As for his statement: “My Lord, these are a \\npeople who do not believe.”\\n89. Pardon them, and say, “Peace.” They will \\ncome to know.\\n44. SMOKE\\n(ad-Dukhan)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Ha, Meem.\\n2. By the Enlightening Scripture.\\n3. We have revealed it on a Blessed Night—\\nWe have warned.\\n4. In it is distinguished every wise command.\\n5. A decree from Us. We have been sending \\nmessages.\\n6. As mercy from your Lord. He is the Hearer, \\nthe Knower.\\n7. Lord of the heavens and the earth and what \\nis between them, if you know for sure.\\n8. There is no god but He. He gives life and \\ncauses death—your Lord and Lord of your \\nancestors of old.\\n9. Yet they play around in doubt.\\n10. So watch out for the Day when the sky pro\\ufffeduces a visible smoke.\\n11. Enveloping mankind; this is a painful pun\\ufffeishment.\\n12. “Our Lord, lift the torment from us, we are \\nbelievers.”\\n13. But how can they be reminded? An enlight\\ufffeening messenger has already come to them.\\n14. But they turned away from him, and said, \\n“Educated, but crazy!”\\n15. We will ease the punishment a little, but \\nyou will revert.\\n16. The Day when We launch the Great As\\ufffesault—We will avenge.\\n17. Before them We tested the people of Phar\\ufffeaoh; a noble messenger came to them.\\n189\\n45. KNEELING (al-Jathiyah)\\n18. Saying, “Hand over Allah’s servants to me. \\nI am an honest messenger to you.”\\n19. And, “Do not exalt yourselves above Allah. \\nI come to you with clear authority.\\n20. I have taken refuge in my Lord and your \\nLord, lest you stone me.\\n21. But if you do not believe in me, keep away \\nfrom me.”\\n22. He appealed to his Lord: “These are a sinful \\npeople.”\\n23. “Set out with My servants by night—you \\nwill be followed.\\n24. And cross the sea quickly; they are an army \\nto be drowned.”\\n25. How many gardens and fountains did they \\nleave behind?\\n26. And plantations, and splendid buildings.\\n27. And comforts they used to enjoy.\\n28. So it was; and We passed it on to another \\npeople. \\n29. Neither heaven nor earth wept over them, \\nnor were they reprieved.\\n30. And We delivered the Children of Israel \\nfrom the humiliating persecution.\\n31. From Pharaoh. He was a transgressing ty\\uffferant. \\n32. And We chose them knowingly over all \\nother people.\\n33. And We gave them many signs, in which \\nwas an obvious test.\\n34. These people say.\\n35. “There is nothing but our first death, and \\nwe will not be resurrected.\\n36. Bring back our ancestors, if you are truth\\ufffeful.”\\n37. Are they better, or the people of Tubba and \\nthose before them? We annihilated them. \\nThey were evildoers.\\n38. We did not create the heavens and the \\nearth and what is between them to play.\\n39. We created them only for a specific pur\\ufffepose, but most of them do not know.\\n40. The Day of Sorting Out is the appointed \\ntime for them all.\\n41. The Day when no friend will avail a friend \\nin any way, and they will not be helped.\\n42. Except for him upon whom Allah has \\nmercy. He is the Mighty, the Merciful.\\n43. The Tree of Bitterness.\\n44. The food of the sinner.\\n45. Like molten lead; boiling inside the bellies.\\n46. Like the boiling of seething water.\\n47. Seize him and drag him into the midst of \\nHell!\\n48. Then pour over his head the suffering of \\nthe Inferno!\\n49. Taste! You who were powerful and noble.\\n50. This is what you used to doubt.\\n51. As for the righteous, they will be in a secure \\nplace.\\n52. Amidst gardens and springs.\\n53. Dressed in silk and brocade, facing one an\\ufffeother.\\n54. So it is, and We will wed them to lovely \\ncompanions.\\n55. They will call therein for every kind of fruit, \\nin peace and security.\\n56. Therein they will not taste death, beyond \\nthe first death; and He will protect them from \\nthe torment of Hell.\\n57. A favor from your Lord. That is the su\\ufffepreme salvation.\\n58. We made it easy in your language, so that \\nthey may remember.\\n59. So wait and watch. They too are waiting \\nand watching.\\n45. KNEELING\\n(al-Jathiyah)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\n190\\n45. KNEELING (al-Jathiyah)\\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Ha, Meem.\\n2. The revelation of the Book is from Allah, \\nthe Exalted in Might, the Wise.\\n3. In the heavens and the earth are proofs for \\nthe believers.\\n4. And in your own creation, and in the crea\\ufffetures He scattered, are signs for people of \\nfirm faith.\\n5. And in the alternation of night and day, and \\nin the sustenance Allah sends down from the \\nsky, with which He revives the earth after its \\ndeath, and in the circulation of the winds, are \\nmarvels for people who reason.\\n6. These are Allah’s Verses which We recite to \\nyou in truth. In which message, after Allah \\nand His revelations, will they believe?\\n7. Woe to every sinful liar.\\n8. Who hears Allah's revelations being recited \\nto him, yet he persists arrogantly, as though \\nhe did not hear them. Announce to him a \\npainful punishment.\\n9. And when he learns something of Our rev\\ufffeelations, he takes them in mockery. For such \\nthere is a shameful punishment.\\n10. Beyond them lies Hell. What they have \\nearned will not benefit them at all, nor will \\nthose they adopted as lords instead of Allah. \\nThey will have a terrible punishment.\\n11. This is guidance. Those who blaspheme \\ntheir Lord’s revelations will have a punish\\ufffement of agonizing pain.\\n12. It is Allah who placed the sea at your ser\\ufffevice, so that ships may run through it by His \\ncommand, and that you may seek of His \\nbounty, and that you may give thanks. \\n13. And He placed at your service whatever is \\nin the heavens and whatever is on earth—all \\nis from Him. In that are signs for a people \\nwho think.\\n14. Tell those who believe to forgive those who \\ndo not hope for the Days of Allah. He will \\nfully recompense people for whatever they \\nhave earned.\\n15. Whoever does a good deed, it is for his soul; \\nand whoever commits evil, it is against it; \\nthen to your Lord you will be returned.\\n16. We gave the Children of Israel the Book, \\nand wisdom, and prophecy; and We pro\\ufffevided them with the good things; and We \\ngave them advantage over all other people.\\n17. And We gave them precise rulings. They \\nfell into dispute only after knowledge came to \\nthem, out of mutual rivalry. Your Lord will \\njudge between them on the Day of Resurrec\\ufffetion regarding the things they differed about.\\n18. Then We set you upon a pathway of faith, \\nso follow it, and do not follow the inclina\\ufffetions of those who do not know.\\n19. They will not help you against Allah in any \\nway. The wrongdoers are allies of one an\\ufffeother, while Allah is the Protector of the \\nrighteous.\\n20. This is an illumination for mankind, and \\nguidance, and mercy for people who believe \\nwith certainty.\\n21. Do those who perpetrate the evil deeds as\\ufffesume that We will regard them as equal to \\nthose who believe and do righteous deeds, \\nwhether in their life or their death? Evil is \\ntheir judgment!\\n22. Allah created the heavens and the earth \\nwith justice, so that every soul will be repaid \\nfor what it has earned. And they will not be \\nwronged.\\n23. Have you considered him who has taken \\nhis desire for his god? Allah has knowingly \\nled him astray, and has sealed his hearing and \\nhis heart, and has placed a veil over his vision. \\nWho will guide him after Allah? Will you not \\nreflect?\\n24. And they say, “There is nothing but this \\nour present life; we die and we live, and noth\\ufffeing destroys us except time.” But they have no \\nknowledge of that; they are only guessing.\\n191\\n46. THE DUNES (al-Ahqaf)\\n25. When Our clarifying Verses are recited to \\nthem, their only argument is to say, “Bring \\nback our ancestors, if you are truthful.”\\n26. Say, “Allah gives you life, then He makes \\nyou die; then He gathers you for the Day of \\nResurrection, about which there is no doubt. \\nBut most people do not know.”\\n27. To Allah belongs the kingship of the heav\\ufffeens and the earth. On the Day when the Hour \\ntakes place, on that Day the falsifiers will lose.\\n28. You will see every community on its knees; \\nevery community will be called to its Book: \\n“Today you are being repaid for what you \\nused to do.\\n29. This Book of Ours speaks about you in \\ntruth. We have been transcribing what you \\nhave been doing.”\\n30. As for those who believed and did right\\ufffeeous deeds, their Lord will admit them into \\nHis mercy. That is the clear triumph.\\n31. But as for those who disbelieved: “Were My \\nrevelations not recited to you? But you \\nturned arrogant, and were guilty people.”\\n32. And when it was said, “The promise of Al\\ufffelah is true, and of the Hour there is no doubt,” \\nyou said, “We do not know what the Hour is; \\nwe think it is only speculation; we are not \\nconvinced.”\\n33. The evils of what they did will become evi\\ufffedent to them, and the very thing they ridi\\ufffeculed will haunt them.\\n34. And it will be said, “Today We forget you, \\nas you forgot the encounter of this Day of \\nyours. Your abode is the Fire, and there are \\nno saviors for you.\\n35. That is because you took Allah’s revela\\ufffetions for a joke, and the worldly life lured \\nyou.” So today they will not be brought out of \\nit, and they will not be allowed to repent.\\n36. Praise belongs to Allah; Lord of the heav\\ufffeens, Lord of the earth, Lord of humanity.\\n37. To Him belongs all supremacy in the heav\\ufffeens and the earth. He is the Majestic, the \\nWise.\\n46. THE DUNES\\n(al-Ahqaf)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Ha, Meem.\\n2. The sending down of the Scripture is from \\nAllah, the Honorable, the Wise.\\n3. We did not create the heavens and the earth \\nand what lies between them except with rea\\ufffeson, and for a finite period. But the blas\\ufffephemers continue to ignore the warnings \\nthey receive.\\n4. Say, “Have you considered those you wor\\ufffeship instead of Allah? Show me which por\\ufffetion of the earth they have created. Or do they \\nown a share of the heavens? Bring me a scrip\\ufffeture prior to this one, or some trace of \\nknowledge, if you are truthful.”\\n5. Who is more wrong than him who invokes, \\nbesides Allah, those who will not answer him \\nuntil the Day of Resurrection, and are heed\\ufffeless of their prayers?\\n6. And when humanity is gathered, they will \\nbe enemies to them, and will renounce their \\nworship of them.\\n7. When Our revelations are recited to them, \\nplain and clear, those who disbelieve say of \\nthe truth when it has come to them, “This is \\nobviously magic.”\\n8. Or do they say, “He invented it himself”? \\nSay, “If I invented it myself, there is nothing \\nyou can do to protect me from Allah. He \\nknows well what you are engaged in. He is \\nsufficient witness between me and you. He is \\nthe Forgiver, the Merciful.”\\n9. Say, “I am not different from the other mes\\ufffesengers; and I do not know what will be done \\nwith me, or with you. I only follow what is in\\ufffespired in me, and I am only a clear warner.”\\n10. Say, “Have you considered? What if it is \\nfrom Allah and you disbelieve in it? A witness \\nfrom the Children of Israel testified to its like, \\n192\\n46. THE DUNES (al-Ahqaf)\\nand has believed, while you turned arrogant. \\nAllah does not guide the unjust people.”\\n11. Those who disbelieve say to those who be\\ufffelieve, “If it were anything good, they would \\nnot have preceded us to it.” And since they \\nwere not guided by it, they will say, “This is \\nan ancient lie.”\\n12. And before it was the Book of Moses, a \\nmodel and a mercy. And this is a confirming \\nBook, in the Arabic language, to warn those \\nwho do wrong—and good news for the doers \\nof good.\\n13. Those who say, “Our Lord is Allah,” then \\nlead a righteous life—they have nothing to \\nfear, nor shall they grieve.\\n14. These are the inhabitants of Paradise, \\nwhere they will dwell forever—a reward for \\nwhat they used to do.\\n15. We have enjoined upon man kindness to \\nhis parents. His mother carried him with dif\\ufffeficulty, and delivered him with difficulty. His \\nbearing and weaning takes thirty months. \\nUntil, when he has attained his maturity, and \\nhas reached forty years, he says, “Lord, enable \\nme to appreciate the blessings You have be\\ufffestowed upon me and upon my parents, and \\nto act with righteousness, pleasing You. And \\nimprove my children for me. I have sincerely \\nrepented to You, and I am of those who have \\nsurrendered.”\\n16. Those are they from whom We accept the \\nbest of their deeds, and We overlook their \\nmisdeeds, among the dwellers of Paradise—\\nthe promise of truth which they are prom\\ufffeised.\\n17. As for him who says to his parents, \\n“Enough of you! Are you promising me that \\nI will be raised up, when generations have \\npassed away before me?” While they cry for \\nAllah’s help, “Woe to you! Believe! The \\npromise of Allah is true!” But he says, “These \\nare nothing but tales of the ancients.”\\n18. Those are they upon whom the sentence is \\njustified, among the communities that have \\npassed away before them, of jinn and hu\\ufffemans. They are truly losers.\\n19. There are degrees for everyone, according \\nto what they have done, and He will repay \\nthem for their works in full, and they will not \\nbe wronged.\\n20. On the Day when the faithless will be pa\\uffferaded before the Fire: “You have squandered \\nyour good in your worldly life, and you took \\npleasure in them. So today you are being re\\ufffepaid with the torment of shame, because of \\nyour unjust arrogance on earth, and because \\nyou used to sin.”\\n21. And mention the brother of Aad, as he \\nwarned his people at the dunes. Warnings \\nhave passed away before him, and after him: \\n“Worship none but Allah; I fear for you the \\npunishment of a tremendous Day.”\\n22. They said, “Did you come to us to divert us \\nfrom our gods? Then bring us what you \\nthreaten us with, if you are being truthful.”\\n23. He said, “The knowledge is only with Al\\ufffelah, and I inform you of what I was sent with; \\nbut I see you are an ignorant people.”\\n24. Then, when they saw a cloud approaching \\ntheir valley, they said, “This is a cloud that \\nwill bring us rain.” “In fact, it is what you \\nwere impatient for: a wind in which is griev\\ufffeous suffering.”\\n25. It will destroy everything by the command \\nof its Lord. And when the morning came \\nupon them, there was nothing to be seen ex\\ufffecept their dwellings. Thus We requite the \\nguilty people.\\n26. We had empowered them in the same way \\nas We empowered you; and We gave them \\nthe hearing, and the sight, and the minds. But \\nneither their hearing, nor their sight, nor \\ntheir minds availed them in any way. That is \\nbecause they disregarded the revelations of \\nAllah; and so they became surrounded by \\nwhat they used to ridicule.\\n27. We have destroyed many townships \\naround you, and diversified the signs, so that \\nthey may return.\\n28. Why then did the idols, whom they wor\\ufffeshiped as means of nearness to Allah, not \\nhelp them? In fact, they abandoned them. It \\n193\\n47. MUHAMMAD (Muhammad)\\nwas their lie, a fabrication of their own mak\\ufffeing.\\n29. Recall when We dispatched towards you a \\nnumber of jinn, to listen to the Quran. When \\nthey came in its presence, they said, “Pay at\\ufffetention!” Then, when it was concluded, they \\nrushed to their people, warning them.\\n30. They said, “O our people, we have heard a \\nScripture, sent down after Moses, confirming \\nwhat came before it. It guides to the truth, \\nand to a straight path.\\n31. O our people! Answer the caller to Allah, \\nand believe in Him; and He will forgive you \\nyour sins, and will save you from a painful \\npunishment.”\\n32. He who does not answer the caller to Allah \\nwill not escape on earth, and has no protec\\ufffetors besides Him. Those are in obvious error.\\n33. Do they not realize that Allah, who created \\nthe heavens and the earth, and was never \\ntired by creating them, is Able to revive the \\ndead? Yes indeed; He is Capable of every\\ufffething.\\n34. On the Day when those who disbelieved \\nare presented to the Fire: “Is this not real?” \\nThey will say, “Yes, indeed, by our Lord.” He \\nwill say, “Then taste the suffering for having \\ndisbelieved.”\\n35. So be patient, as the messengers with re\\ufffesolve were patient, and do not be hasty re\\ufffegarding them. On the Day when they witness \\nwhat they are promised, it will seem as if they \\nhad lasted only for an hour of a day. A proc\\ufffelamation: Will any be destroyed except the \\nsinful people?\\n47. MUHAMMAD\\n(Muhammad)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Those who disbelieve and repel from the \\npath of Allah—He nullifies their works.\\n2. While those who believe, and work right\\ufffeeousness, and believe in what was sent down \\nto Muhammad—and it is the truth from their \\nLord—He remits their sins, and relieves their \\nconcerns.\\n3. That is because those who disbelieve follow \\nfalsehoods, while those who believe follow \\nthe truth from their Lord. Allah thus cites for \\nthe people their examples.\\n4. When you encounter those who disbelieve, \\nstrike at their necks. Then, when you have \\nrouted them, bind them firmly. Then, either \\nrelease them by grace, or by ransom, until \\nwar lays down its burdens. Had Allah willed, \\nHe could have defeated them Himself, but He \\nthus tests some of you by means of others. As \\nfor those who are killed in the way of Allah, \\nHe will not let their deeds go to waste.\\n5. He will guide them, and will improve their \\nstate of mind.\\n6. And will admit them into Paradise, which \\nHe has identified for them.\\n7. O you who believe! If you support Allah, He \\nwill support you, and will strengthen your \\nfoothold.\\n8. But as for those who disbelieve, for them is \\nperdition, and He will waste their deeds.\\n9. That is because they hated what Allah re\\ufffevealed, so He nullified their deeds.\\n10. Have they not journeyed through the earth \\nand seen the consequences for those before \\nthem? Allah poured destruction upon them, \\nand for the unbelievers is something compa\\uffferable.\\n11. That is because Allah is the Master of those \\nwho believe, while the disbelievers have no \\nmaster.\\n12. Allah will admit those who believe and do \\ngood deeds into gardens beneath which riv\\ufffeers flow. As for those who disbelieve, they en\\ufffejoy themselves, and eat as cattle eat, and the \\nFire will be their dwelling.\\n13. How many a town was more powerful than \\nyour town which evicted you? We destroyed \\nthem, and there was no helper for them.\\n14. Is he who stands upon evidence from his \\nLord, like someone whose evil deed is made \\n194\\n47. MUHAMMAD (Muhammad)\\nto appear good to him? And they follow their \\nown desires?\\n15. The likeness of the Garden promised to the \\nrighteous: in it are rivers of pure water, and \\nrivers of milk forever fresh, and rivers of wine \\ndelightful to the drinkers, and rivers of \\nstrained honey. And therein they will have of \\nevery fruit, and forgiveness from their Lord. \\nLike one abiding in the Fire forever, and are \\ngiven to drink boiling water, that cuts-up \\ntheir bowels?\\n16. Among them are those who listen to you, \\nbut when they leave your presence, they say \\nto those given knowledge, “What did he say \\njust now?” Those are they whose hearts Allah \\nhas sealed, and they follow their own desires.\\n17. As for those who are guided, He increases \\nthem in guidance, and He has granted them \\ntheir righteousness.\\n18. Are they just waiting until the Hour comes \\nto them suddenly? Its tokens have already \\ncome. But how will they be reminded when it \\nhas come to them?\\n19. Know that there is no god but Allah, and \\nask forgiveness for your sin, and for the be\\ufffelieving men and believing women. Allah \\nknows your movements, and your resting\\ufffeplace.\\n20. Those who believe say, “If only a chapter is \\nsent down.” Yet when a decisive chapter is \\nsent down, and fighting is mentioned in it, \\nyou see those in whose hearts is sickness \\nlooking at you with the look of someone \\nfainting at death. So woe to them!\\n21. Obedience and upright speech. Then, \\nwhen the matter is settled, being true to Allah \\nwould have been better for them.\\n22. If you turn away, you are likely to make \\nmischief on earth, and sever your family ties.\\n23. Those are they whom Allah has cursed. He \\nmade them deaf, and blinded their sight.\\n24. Will they not ponder the Quran? Or are \\nthere locks upon their hearts?\\n25. Those who reverted after the guidance be\\ufffecame clear to them—Satan has enticed them, \\nand has given them latitude. \\n26. That is because they said to those who \\nhated what Allah has revealed, “We will obey \\nyou in certain matters.” But Allah knows \\ntheir secret thoughts.\\n27. How about when the angels take them at \\ndeath, beating their faces and their backs?\\n28. That is because they pursued what dis\\ufffepleases Allah, and they disliked His approval, \\nso He nullified their works.\\n29. Do those in whose hearts is sickness think \\nthat Allah will not expose their malice?\\n30. Had We willed, We could have shown \\nthem to you, and you would have recognized \\nthem by their marks. Yet you will recognize \\nthem by their tone of speech. And Allah \\nknows your actions.\\n31. We will certainly test you, until We know \\nthose among you who strive, and those who \\nare steadfast, and We will test your reactions.\\n32. Those who disbelieve, and hinder from the \\npath of Allah, and oppose the Messenger af\\ufffeter guidance has become clear to them—they \\nwill not hurt Allah in the least, but He will \\nnullify their deeds.\\n33. O you who believe! Obey Allah, and obey \\nthe Messenger, and do not let your deeds go \\nto waste.\\n34. Those who disbelieve, and hinder from Al\\ufffelah’s path, and then die as disbelievers—Al\\ufffelah will not forgive them.\\n35. So do not waver and call for peace while \\nyou have the upper hand. Allah is with you, \\nand He will not waste your efforts.\\n36. The life of this world is nothing but play \\nand pastime. But if you have faith and lead a \\nrighteous life, He will grant you your re\\ufffewards, and He will not ask you for your pos\\ufffesessions.\\n37. Were He to ask you for it, and press you, \\nyou would become tightfisted, and He would \\nexpose your unwillingness.\\n195\\n48. VICTORY (al-Fath)\\n38. Here you are, being called to spend in the \\ncause of Allah. Among you are those who \\nwithhold; but whoever withholds is with\\ufffeholding against his own soul. Allah is the \\nRich, while you are the needy. And if you \\nturn away, He will replace you with another \\npeople, and they will not be like you.\\n48. VICTORY\\n(al-Fath)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. We have granted you a conspicuous victory.\\n2. That Allah may forgive you your sin, past \\nand to come, and complete His favors upon \\nyou, and guide you in a straight path.\\n3. And help you with an unwavering support.\\n4. It is He who sent down tranquility into the \\nhearts of the believers, to add faith to their \\nfaith. To Allah belong the forces of the heav\\ufffeens and the earth. Allah is Knowing and \\nWise.\\n5. He will admit the believers, male and fe\\ufffemale, into Gardens beneath which rivers \\nflow, to abide therein forever, and He will re\\ufffemit their sins. That, with Allah, is a great tri\\ufffeumph. \\n6. And He will punish the hypocrites, male \\nand female, and the idolaters, male and fe\\ufffemale, those who harbor evil thoughts about \\nAllah. They are surrounded by evil; and Allah \\nis angry with them, and has cursed them, and \\nhas prepared for them Hell—a miserable des\\ufffetination.\\n7. To Allah belong the troops of the heavens \\nand the earth. Allah is Mighty and Wise.\\n8. We sent you as a witness, and a bearer of \\ngood news, and a warner.\\n9. That you may believe in Allah and His Mes\\ufffesenger, and support Him, and honor Him, \\nand praise Him morning and evening.\\n10. Those who pledge allegiance to you are \\npledging allegiance to Allah. The hand of Al\\ufffelah is over their hands. Whoever breaks his \\npledge breaks it to his own loss. And whoever \\nfulfills his covenant with Allah, He will grant \\nhim a great reward.\\n11. The Desert-Arabs who remained behind \\nwill say to you, “Our belongings and our fam\\ufffeilies have preoccupied us, so ask forgiveness \\nfor us.” They say with their tongues what is \\nnot in their hearts. Say, “Who can avail you \\nanything against Allah, if He desires loss for \\nyou, or desires gain for you?” In fact, Allah is \\nInformed of what you do.\\n12. But you thought that the Messenger and \\nthe believers will never return to their fami\\ufffelies, and this seemed fine to your hearts; and \\nyou harbored evil thoughts, and were uncivi\\ufffelized people.\\n13. He who does not believe in Allah and His \\nMessenger—We have prepared for the disbe\\ufffelievers a Blazing Fire.\\n14. To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heav\\ufffeens and the earth. He forgives whomever He \\nwills, and He punishes whomever He wills. \\nAllah is Forgiving and Merciful.\\n15. Those who lagged behind will say when \\nyou depart to collect the gains, “Let us follow \\nyou.” They want to change the Word of Al\\ufffelah. Say, “You will not follow us; Allah has \\nsaid so before.” Then they will say, “But you \\nare jealous of us.” In fact, they understand \\nonly a little.\\n16. Say to the Desert-Arabs who lagged be\\ufffehind, “You will be called against a people of \\ngreat might; you will fight them, unless they \\nsubmit. If you obey, Allah will give you a fine \\nreward. But if you turn away, as you turned \\naway before, He will punish you with a pain\\ufffeful punishment.”\\n17. There is no blame on the blind, nor any \\nblame on the lame, nor any blame on the sick. \\nWhoever obeys Allah and His Messenger—\\nHe will admit him into gardens beneath \\nwhich rivers flow; but whoever turns away—\\nHe will punish him with a painful punish\\ufffement.\\n18. Allah was pleased with the believers, when \\nthey pledged allegiance to you under the tree. \\n196\\n49. THE CHAMBERS (al-Hujurat)\\nHe knew what was in their hearts, and sent \\ndown serenity upon them, and rewarded \\nthem with an imminent conquest.\\n19. And abundant gains for them to capture. \\nAllah is Mighty and Wise.\\n20. Allah has promised you abundant gains, \\nwhich you will capture. He has expedited this \\nfor you, and has restrained people’s hands \\nfrom you; that it may be a sign to the believ\\ufffeers, and that He may guide you on a straight \\npath.\\n21. And other things, of which you were inca\\ufffepable, but Allah has encompassed them. Al\\ufffelah is Capable of everything.\\n22. If those who disbelieve had fought you, \\nthey would have turned back and fled, then \\nfound neither protector nor helper.\\n23. It is Allah’s pattern, ongoing since the past. \\nYou will never find any change in Allah’s pat\\ufffetern.\\n24. It is He who withheld their hands from \\nyou, and your hands from them, in the valley \\nof Mecca, after giving you advantage over \\nthem. Allah is Observer of what you do.\\n25. It is they who disbelieved, and barred you \\nfrom the Sacred Mosque, and prevented the \\noffering from reaching its destination. Were \\nit not for faithful men and faithful women, \\nwhom you did not know, you were about to \\nhurt them, and became guilty of an uninten\\ufffetional crime. Thus Allah admits into His \\nmercy whomever He wills. Had they dis\\ufffepersed, We would have punished those who \\ndisbelieved among them with a painful pen\\ufffealty.\\n26. Those who disbelieved filled their hearts \\nwith rage—the rage of the days of ignorance. \\nBut Allah sent His serenity down upon His \\nMessenger, and upon the believers, and im\\ufffeposed on them the words of righteousness—\\nof which they were most worthy and deserv\\ufffeing. Allah is aware of everything.\\n27. Allah has fulfilled His Messenger’s vision \\nin truth: “You will enter the Sacred Mosque, \\nAllah willing, in security, heads shaven, or\\nhair cut short, not fearing. He knew what you \\ndid not know, and has granted besides that an \\nimminent victory.”\\n28. It is He who sent His Messenger with the \\nguidance and the religion of truth, to make it \\nprevail over all religions. Allah suffices as \\nWitness.\\n29. Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. \\nThose with him are stern against the disbe\\ufffelievers, yet compassionate amongst them\\ufffeselves. You see them kneeling, prostrating, \\nseeking blessings from Allah and approval. \\nTheir marks are on their faces from the ef\\ufffefects of prostration. Such is their description \\nin the Torah, and their description in the \\nGospel: like a plant that sprouts, becomes \\nstrong, grows thick, and rests on its stem, im\\ufffepressing the farmers. Through them He en\\uffferages the disbelievers. Allah has promised \\nthose among them who believe and do good \\ndeeds forgiveness and a great reward.\\n49. THE CHAMBERS\\n(al-Hujurat)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. O you who believe! Do not place your opin\\ufffeions above that of Allah and His Messenger, \\nand fear Allah. Allah is Hearing and Know\\ufffeing.\\n2. O you who believe! Do not raise your voices \\nabove the voice of the Prophet, and do not \\nspeak loudly to him, as you speak loudly to \\none another, lest your works be in vain with\\ufffeout you realizing.\\n3. Those who lower their voices before Allah’s \\nMessenger—those are they whose hearts Al\\ufffelah has tested for piety. They will have for\\ufffegiveness and a great reward.\\n4. Those who call you from behind the cham\\ufffebers—most of them do not understand.\\n5. Had they remained patient until you came \\nout to them, it would have been better for \\nthem. But Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.\\n197\\n50. QAF (Qaf)\\n6. O you who believe! If a troublemaker brings \\nyou any news, investigate, lest you harm peo\\ufffeple out of ignorance, and you become regret\\ufffeful for what you have done.\\n7. And know that among you is the Messenger \\nof Allah. Had he obeyed you in many things, \\nyou would have suffered hardship. But Allah \\nhas given you the love of faith, and adorned \\nit in your hearts, and made disbelief, mis\\ufffechief, and rebellion hateful to you. These are \\nthe rightly guided.\\n8. A Grace and Favor from Allah. Allah is \\nKnowing and Wise.\\n9. If two groups of believers fight each other, \\nreconcile between them. But if one group ag\\ufffegresses against the other, fight the aggressing \\ngroup until it complies with Allah’s com\\ufffemand. Once it has complied, reconcile be\\ufffetween them with justice, and be equitable. Al\\ufffelah loves the equitable.\\n10. The believers are brothers, so reconcile be\\ufffetween your brothers, and remain conscious \\nof Allah, so that you may receive mercy.\\n11. O you who believe! No people shall ridicule \\nother people, for they may be better than \\nthey. Nor shall any women ridicule other \\nwomen, for they may be better than they. Nor \\nshall you slander one another, nor shall you \\ninsult one another with names. Evil is the re\\ufffeturn to wickedness after having attained \\nfaith. Whoever does not repent—these are \\nthe wrongdoers.\\n12. O you who believe! Avoid most suspi\\ufffecion—some suspicion is sinful. And do not \\nspy on one another, nor backbite one an\\ufffeother. Would any of you like to eat the flesh \\nof his dead brother? You would detest it. So \\nremain mindful of Allah. Allah is Most Re\\ufffelenting, Most Merciful.\\n13. O people! We created you from a male and \\na female, and made you races and tribes, that \\nyou may know one another. The best among \\nyou in the sight of Allah is the most righteous. \\nAllah is All-Knowing, Well-Experienced.\\n14. The Desert-Arabs say, “We have believed.” \\nSay, “You have not believed; but say, ‘We \\nhave submitted,’ for faith has not yet entered \\ninto your hearts. But if you obey Allah and \\nHis Messenger, He will not diminish any of \\nyour deeds. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.”\\n15. The believers are those who believe in Al\\ufffelah and His Messenger, and then have not \\ndoubted, and strive for Allah’s cause with \\ntheir wealth and their persons. These are the \\nsincere.\\n16. Say, “Are you going to teach Allah about \\nyour religion, when Allah knows everything \\nin the heavens and the earth, and Allah is \\naware of all things?”\\n17. They regarded it a favor to you that they \\nhave submitted. Say, “Do not consider your \\nsubmission a favor to me; it is Allah who has \\ndone you a favor by guiding you to the faith, \\nif you are sincere.”\\n18. Allah knows the secrets of the heavens and \\nthe earth, and Allah is seeing of everything \\nyou do.\\n50. QAF\\n(Qaf)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Qaf. By the Glorious Quran.\\n2. They marveled that a warner has come to \\nthem from among them. The disbelievers say, \\n“This is something strange.\\n3. When we have died and become dust? This \\nis a farfetched return.”\\n4. We know what the earth consumes of them, \\nand with Us is a comprehensive book.\\n5. But they denied the truth when it has come \\nto them, so they are in a confused state.\\n6. Have they not observed the sky above them, \\nhow We constructed it, and decorated it, and \\nit has no cracks?\\n7. And the earth, how We spread it out, and \\nset on it mountains, and grew in it all kinds \\nof delightful pairs?\\n198\\n50. QAF (Qaf)\\n8. A lesson and a reminder for every penitent \\nworshiper.\\n9. And We brought down from the sky blessed \\nwater, and produced with it gardens and \\ngrain to harvest.\\n10. And the soaring palm trees, with clustered \\ndates.\\n11. As sustenance for the servants. And We re\\ufffevive thereby a dead town. Likewise is the res\\ufffeurrection.\\n12. Before them the people of Noah denied the \\ntruth, and so did the dwellers of Russ, and \\nThamood.\\n13. And Aad, and Pharaoh, and the brethren of \\nLot.\\n14. And the Dwellers of the Woods, and the \\npeople of Tubba. They all rejected the mes\\ufffesengers, so My threat came true.\\n15. Were We fatigued by the first creation? But \\nthey are in doubt of a new creation.\\n16. We created the human being, and We \\nknow what his soul whispers to him. We are \\nnearer to him than his jugular vein.\\n17. As the two receivers receive, seated to the \\nright and to the left.\\n18. Not a word does he utter, but there is a \\nwatcher by him, ready.\\n19. The daze of death has come in truth: “This \\nis what you tried to evade.”\\n20. And the Trumpet is blown: “This is the \\nPromised Day.”\\n21. And every soul will come forward, accom\\ufffepanied by a driver and a witness.\\n22. “You were in neglect of this, so We lifted \\nyour screen from you, and your vision today \\nis keen.”\\n23. And His escort will say, “This is what I have \\nready with me.”\\n24. “Throw into Hell every stubborn disbe\\ufffeliever.\\n25. Preventer of good, aggressor, doubter.\\n26. Who fabricated another god with Allah; \\ntoss him into the intense agony.”\\n27. His escort will say, “Our Lord, I did not \\nmake him rebel, but he was far astray.”\\n28. He will say, “Do not feud in My presence—\\nI had warned you in advance.\\n29. The decree from Me will not be changed, \\nand I am not unjust to the servants.”\\n30. On the Day when We will say to Hell, “Are \\nyou full?” And it will say, “Are there any \\nmore?”\\n31. And Paradise will be brought closer to the \\npious, not far away.\\n32. “This is what you were promised—for \\nevery careful penitent.\\n33. Who inwardly feared the Most Gracious, \\nand came with a repentant heart.\\n34. Enter it in peace. This is the Day of Eter\\ufffenity.”\\n35. Therein they will have whatever they de\\ufffesire—and We have even more.\\n36. How many generations before them, who \\nwere more powerful than they, did We de\\ufffestroy? They explored the lands—was there \\nany escape?\\n37. In that is a reminder for whoever possesses \\na heart, or cares to listen and witness.\\n38. We created the heavens and the earth and \\nwhat is between them in six days, and no fa\\ufffetigue touched Us.\\n39. So endure what they say, and proclaim the \\npraises of your Lord before the rising of the \\nsun, and before sunset.\\n40. And glorify Him during the night, and at \\nthe end of devotions.\\n41. And listen for the Day when the caller calls \\nfrom a nearby place.\\n42. The Day when they will hear the Shout in \\nall truth. That is the Day of Emergence.\\n43. It is We who control life and death, and to \\nUs is the destination.\\n44. The Day when the earth will crack for them \\nat once. That is an easy gathering for Us.\\n199\\n51. THE SPREADERS (adh-Dhariyat)\\n45. We are fully aware of what they say, and \\nyou are not a dictator over them. So remind \\nby the Quran whoever fears My warning.\\n51. THE SPREADERS\\n(adh-Dhariyat)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. By the spreaders spreading.\\n2. And those carrying loads.\\n3. And those moving gently.\\n4. And those distributing as commanded.\\n5. What you are promised is true.\\n6. Judgment will take place.\\n7. By the sky that is woven.\\n8. You differ in what you say.\\n9. Averted from it is he who is averted.\\n10. Perish the imposters.\\n11. Those who are dazed in ignorance.\\n12. They ask, “When is the Day of Judgment?”\\n13. The Day they are presented to the Fire.\\n14. “Taste your ordeal. This is what you used \\nto challenge.”\\n15. But the pious are amidst gardens and \\nsprings.\\n16. Receiving what their Lord has given them. \\nThey were virtuous before that.\\n17. They used to sleep a little at night.\\n18. And at dawn, they would pray for pardon.\\n19. And in their wealth, there was a share for \\nthe beggar and the deprived.\\n20. And on earth are signs for the convinced.\\n21. And within yourselves. Do you not see?\\n22. And in the heaven is your livelihood, and \\nwhat you are promised.\\n23. By the Lord of the heaven and the earth, it \\nis as true as the fact that you speak.\\n24. Has the story of Abraham’s honorable \\nguests reached you?\\n25. When they entered upon him, they said, \\n“Peace.” He said, “Peace, strangers.”\\n26. Then he slipped away to his family, and \\nbrought a fatted calf.\\n27. He set it before them. He said, “Will you \\nnot eat?”\\n28. And he harbored fear of them. They said, \\n“Do not fear,” and they announced to him the \\ngood news of a knowledgeable boy.\\n29. His wife came forward crying. She clasped \\nher face, and said, “A barren old woman?”\\n30. They said, “Thus spoke your Lord. He is \\nthe Wise, the Knowing.”\\n31. He said, “What is your business, O en\\ufffevoys?”\\n32. They said, “We are sent to a people guilty \\nof sin.”\\n33. “To unleash upon them rocks of clay.”\\n34. “Marked by your Lord for the excessive.”\\n35. We evacuated all the believers who were in \\nit.\\n36. But found in it only one household of Mus\\ufffelims.\\n37. And We left in it a sign for those who fear \\nthe painful punishment.\\n38. And in Moses. We sent him to Pharaoh \\nwith a clear authority.\\n39. But he turned away with his warlords, and \\nsaid, “A sorcerer or a madman.”\\n40. So We seized him and his troops, and \\nthrew them into the sea, and He was to \\nblame.\\n41. And in Aad. We unleashed against them \\nthe devastating wind.\\n42. It spared nothing it came upon, but ren\\ufffedered it like decayed ruins.\\n43. And in Thamood. They were told, “Enjoy \\nyourselves for a while.”\\n200\\n52. THE MOUNT (at-Tur)\\n44. But they defied the command of their Lord, \\nso the lightning struck them as they looked \\non.\\n45. They could not rise up, nor could they find \\nhelp.\\n46. And before that, the people of Noah. They \\nwere immoral people.\\n47. We constructed the universe with power, \\nand We are expanding it.\\n48. And the earth—We spread it out—How \\nwell We prepared it!\\n49. We created all things in pairs, so that you \\nmay reflect and ponder.\\n50. “So flee towards Allah. I am to you from \\nHim a clear warner.”\\n51. “And do not set up any other god with Al\\ufffelah. I am to you from Him a clear warner.”\\n52. Likewise, no messenger came to those be\\ufffefore them, but they said, “A sorcerer or a \\nmadman.”\\n53. Did they recommend it to one another? In \\nfact, they are rebellious people.\\n54. So turn away from them; you are not to \\nblame.\\n55. And remind, for the reminder benefits the \\nbelievers.\\n56. I did not create the jinn and the humans \\nexcept to worship Me.\\n57. I need no livelihood from them, nor do I \\nneed them to feed Me.\\n58. Allah is the Provider, the One with Power, \\nthe Strong.\\n59. Those who do wrong will have their turn, \\nlike the turn of their counterparts, so let them \\nnot rush Me.\\n60. So woe to those who disbelieve because of \\nthat Day of theirs which they are promised.\\n52. THE MOUNT\\n(at-Tur)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. By the Mount.\\n2. And a Book inscribed.\\n3. In a published scroll.\\n4. And the frequented House.\\n5. And the elevated roof.\\n6. And the seething sea.\\n7. The punishment of your Lord is coming.\\n8. There is nothing to avert it.\\n9. On the Day when the heaven sways in agi\\ufffetation.\\n10. And the mountains go into motion.\\n11. Woe on that Day to the deniers.\\n12. Those who play with speculation.\\n13. The Day when they are shoved into the Fire \\nof Hell forcefully.\\n14. “This is the Fire which you used to deny.\\n15. Is this magic, or do you not see?\\n16. Burn in it. Whether you are patient, or im\\ufffepatient, it is the same for you. You are only \\nbeing repaid for what you used to do.”\\n17. But the righteous will be amid gardens and \\nbliss.\\n18. Enjoying what their Lord has given them, \\nand their Lord has spared them the suffering \\nof Hell.\\n19. Eat and drink happily, for what you used to \\ndo.\\n20. Relaxing on luxurious furnishings; and We \\nwill couple them with gorgeous spouses.\\n21. Those who believed, and their offspring \\nfollowed them in faith—We will unite them \\nwith their offspring, and We will not deprive \\nthem of any of their works. Every person is \\nhostage to what he has earned.\\n22. And We will supply them with fruit, and \\nmeat; such as they desire.\\n23. They will exchange therein a cup; wherein \\nis neither harm, nor sin.\\n24. Serving them will be youths like hidden \\npearls.\\n201\\n53. THE STAR (an-Najm)\\n25. And they will approach one another, in\\ufffequiring.\\n26. They will say, “Before this, we were fearful \\nfor our families.\\n27. But Allah blessed us, and spared us the ag\\ufffeony of the Fiery Winds.\\n28. Before this, we used to pray to Him. He is \\nthe Good, the Compassionate.”\\n29. So remind. By the grace of your Lord, you \\nare neither a soothsayer, nor a madman.\\n30. Or do they say, “A poet—we await for him \\na calamity of time”?\\n31. Say, “Go on waiting; I will be waiting with \\nyou.”\\n32. Or is it that their dreams compel them to \\nthis? Or are they aggressive people?\\n33. Or do they say, “He made it up”? Rather, \\nthey do not believe.\\n34. So let them produce a discourse like it, if \\nthey are truthful.\\n35. Or were they created out of nothing? Or \\nare they the creators?\\n36. Or did they create the heavens and the \\nearth? In fact, they are not certain.\\n37. Or do they possess the treasuries of your \\nLord? Or are they the controllers?\\n38. Or do they have a stairway by means of \\nwhich they listen? Then let their listener pro\\ufffeduce a clear proof.\\n39. Or for Him the daughters, and for you the \\nsons?\\n40. Or do you demand a payment from them, \\nand they are burdened by debt?\\n41. Or do they know the future, and they are \\nwriting it down?\\n42. Or are they planning a conspiracy? The \\nconspiracy will befall the disbelievers.\\n43. Or do they have a god besides Allah? Allah \\ntranscends what they associate.\\n44. Even if they were to see lumps of the sky \\nfalling down, they would say, “A mass of \\nclouds.”\\n45. So leave them until they meet their Day in \\nwhich they will be stunned.\\n46. The Day when their ploys will avail them \\nnothing; and they will not be helped.\\n47. For those who do wrong, there is a punish\\ufffement besides that; but most of them do not \\nknow.\\n48. So patiently await the decision of your \\nLord, for you are before Our Eyes; and pro\\ufffeclaim the praises of your Lord when you \\narise.\\n49. And glorify Him during the night, and at \\nthe receding of the stars.\\n53. THE STAR\\n(an-Najm)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. By the star as it goes down.\\n2. Your friend has not gone astray, nor has he \\nerred.\\n3. Nor does he speak out of desire.\\n4. It is but a revelation revealed.\\n5. Taught to him by the Extremely Powerful.\\n6. The one of vigor. He settled.\\n7. While he was at the highest horizon.\\n8. Then he came near, and hovered around.\\n9. He was within two bows’ length, or closer.\\n10. Then He revealed to His servant what He \\nrevealed.\\n11. The heart did not lie about what it saw.\\n12. Will you dispute with him concerning \\nwhat he saw?\\n13. He saw him on another descent.\\n14. At the Lotus Tree of the Extremity.\\n15. Near which is the Garden of Repose.\\n16. As there covered the Lotus Tree what cov\\ufffeered it.\\n17. The sight did not waver, nor did it exceed.\\n202\\n53. THE STAR (an-Najm)\\n18. He saw some of the Great Signs of his Lord.\\n19. Have you considered al-Lat and al-Uzza?\\n20. And Manat, the third one, the other?\\n21. Are you to have the males, and He the fe\\ufffemales?\\n22. What a bizarre distribution.\\n23. These are nothing but names, which you \\nhave devised, you and your ancestors, for \\nwhich Allah sent down no authority. They \\nfollow nothing but assumptions, and what \\nthe ego desires, even though guidance has \\ncome to them from their Lord.\\n24. Or is the human being to have whatever he \\ndesires?\\n25. To Allah belong the Last and the First.\\n26. How many an angel is there in the heavens \\nwhose intercession avails nothing, except af\\ufffeter Allah gives permission to whomever He \\nwills, and approves?\\n27. Those who do not believe in the Hereafter \\ngive the angels the names of females.\\n28. They have no knowledge of that. They only \\nfollow assumptions, and assumptions are no \\nsubstitute for the truth.\\n29. So avoid him who has turned away from \\nOur remembrance, and desires nothing but \\nthe present life.\\n30. That is the extent of their knowledge. Your \\nLord knows best who has strayed from His \\npath, and He knows best who has accepted \\nguidance.\\n31. To Allah belongs whatever is in the heav\\ufffeens and whatever is on earth. He will repay \\nthose who do evil according to their deeds, \\nand recompense those who do good with the \\nbest.\\n32. Those who avoid gross sins and indecen\\ufffecies—except for minor lapses—your Lord is \\nof Vast Forgiveness. He knows you well, ever \\nsince He created you from the earth, and ever \\nsince you were embryos in your mothers’ \\nwombs. So do not acclaim your own virtue; \\nHe is fully aware of the righteous.\\n33. Have you considered him who turned \\naway?\\n34. And gave a little, and held back?\\n35. Does he possess knowledge of the unseen, \\nand can therefore foresee?\\n36. Or was he not informed of what is in the \\nScrolls of Moses?\\n37. And of Abraham, who fulfilled?\\n38. That no soul bears the burdens of another \\nsoul.\\n39. And that the human being attains only \\nwhat he strives for.\\n40. And that his efforts will be witnessed.\\n41. Then he will be rewarded for it the fullest \\nreward.\\n42. And that to your Lord is the finality.\\n43. And that it is He who causes laughter and \\nweeping.\\n44.And that it is He who gives death and life.\\n45. And that it is He who created the two \\nkinds—the male and the female.\\n46. From a sperm drop, when emitted.\\n47. And that upon Him is the next existence.\\n48. And that it is He who enriches and impov\\ufffeerishes.\\n49.And that it is He who is the Lord of Sirius.\\n50. And that it is He who destroyed the first \\nAad.\\n51. And Thamood, sparing no one.\\n52. And the people of Noah before that; for \\nthey were most unjust and most oppressive.\\n53. And He toppled the ruined cities.\\n54. And covered them with whatever covered \\nthem.\\n55. So which of your Lord's marvels can you \\ndeny?\\n56. This is a warning, just like the first warn\\ufffeings.\\n57. The inevitable is imminent.\\n58. None besides Allah can unveil it.\\n203\\n54. THE MOON (al-Qamar)\\n59. Do you marvel at this discourse?\\n60. And laugh, and do not weep?\\n61. Lost in your frivolity?\\n62. So bow down to Allah, and worship!\\n54. THE MOON\\n(al-Qamar)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. The Hour has drawn near, and the moon \\nhas split.\\n2. Yet whenever they see a miracle, they turn \\naway, and say, “Continuous magic.”\\n3. They lied, and followed their opinions, but \\neverything has its time.\\n4. And there came to them news containing a \\ndeterrent.\\n5. Profound wisdom—but warnings are of no \\navail.\\n6. So turn away from them. On the Day when \\nthe Caller calls to something terrible.\\n7. Their eyes humiliated, they will emerge \\nfrom the graves, as if they were swarming lo\\ufffecusts.\\n8. Scrambling towards the Caller, the disbe\\ufffelievers will say, “This is a difficult Day.”\\n9. Before them the people of Noah disbelieved. \\nThey rejected Our servant, and said, “Crazy,” \\nand he was rebuked.\\n10. So he appealed to his Lord, “I am over\\ufffewhelmed, so help me.”\\n11. So We opened the floodgates of heaven \\nwith water pouring down.\\n12. And We made the earth burst with springs, \\nand the waters met for a purpose already des\\ufffetined.\\n13. And We carried him on a craft of planks \\nand nails.\\n14. Sailing before Our eyes; a reward for him \\nwho was rejected.\\n15. And We left it as a sign. Is there anyone \\nwho would take heed?\\n16. So how were My punishment and My \\nwarnings?\\n17. We made the Quran easy to learn. Is there \\nanyone who would learn?\\n18. Aad denied the truth. So how were My \\npunishment and My warnings?\\n19. We unleashed upon them a screaming \\nwind, on a day of unrelenting misery.\\n20. Plucking the people away, as though they \\nwere trunks of uprooted palm-trees.\\n21. So how were My punishment and My \\nwarnings?\\n22. We made the Quran easy to remember. Is \\nthere anyone who would remember?\\n23. Thamood rejected the warnings.\\n24. They said, “Are we to follow one of us, a \\nhuman being? We would then go astray, and \\nend up in Hell.\\n25. Was the message given to him, out of all of \\nus? In fact, he is a wicked liar.”\\n26. They will know tomorrow who the wicked \\nliar is.\\n27. We are sending the she-camel as a test for \\nthem; so watch them and be patient.\\n28. And inform them that the water is to be \\nshared between them; each share of drink \\nmade available.\\n29. But they called their friend, and he dared, \\nand he slaughtered.\\n30. So how were My punishment and My \\nwarnings?\\n31. We sent against them a single Scream, and \\nthey became like crushed hay.\\n32. We made the Quran easy to understand. Is \\nthere anyone who would understand?\\n33. The people of Lot rejected the warnings.\\n34. We unleashed upon them a shower of\\nstones, except for the family of Lot; We res\\ufffecued them at dawn.\\n204\\n55. THE COMPASSIONATE (ar-Rahman)\\n35. A blessing from Us. Thus We reward the \\nthankful.\\n36. He had warned them of Our onslaught, but \\nthey dismissed the warnings.\\n37. They even lusted for his guest, so We oblit\\ufffeerated their eyes. “So taste My punishment \\nand My warnings.”\\n38. Early morning brought upon them endur\\ufffeing punishment.\\n39. So taste My punishment and My warnings.\\n40. We made the Quran easy to memorize. Is \\nthere anyone who would memorize?\\n41. The warnings also came to the people of \\nPharaoh.\\n42. They rejected Our signs, all of them, so We \\nseized them—the seizure of an Almighty \\nOmnipotent.\\n43. Are your unbelievers better than all those? \\nOr do you have immunity in the scriptures?\\n44. Or do they say, “We are united, and we will \\nbe victorious”?\\n45. The multitude will be defeated, and they \\nwill turn their backs.\\n46. The Hour is their appointed time—the \\nHour is more disastrous, and most bitter.\\n47. The wicked are in confusion and madness.\\n48. The Day when they are dragged upon their \\nfaces into the Fire: “Taste the touch of Saqar.”\\n49. Everything We created is precisely meas\\ufffeured.\\n50. And Our command is but once, like the \\ntwinkling of an eye.\\n51. We have destroyed your likes. Is there an\\ufffeyone who would ponder?\\n52. Everything they have done is in the Books.\\n53. Everything, small or large, is written down.\\n54. The righteous will be amidst gardens and \\nrivers.\\n55. In an assembly of virtue, in the presence of \\nan Omnipotent King.\\n55. THE COMPASSIONATE\\n(ar-Rahman)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. The Compassionate.\\n2. Has taught the Quran.\\n3. He created man.\\n4. And taught him clear expression.\\n5. The sun and the moon move according to \\nplan.\\n6. And the stars and the trees prostrate them\\ufffeselves.\\n7. And the sky, He raised; and He set up the \\nbalance.\\n8. So do not transgress in the balance.\\n9. But maintain the weights with justice, and \\ndo not violate the balance.\\n10. And the earth; He set up for the creatures.\\n11. In it are fruits, and palms in clusters.\\n12. And grains in the blades, and fragrant \\nplants.\\n13. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you \\ndeny?\\n14. He created man from hard clay, like bricks.\\n15. And created the jinn from a fusion of fire.\\n16. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you \\ndeny?\\n17. Lord of the two Easts and Lord of the two \\nWests.\\n18. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you \\ndeny?\\n19. He merged the two seas, converging to\\ufffegether.\\n20. Between them is a barrier, which they do \\nnot overrun.\\n21. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you \\ndeny?\\n22. From them emerge pearls and coral.\\n205\\n55. THE COMPASSIONATE (ar-Rahman)\\n23. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you \\ndeny?\\n24. His are the ships, raised above the sea like \\nlandmarks.\\n25. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you \\ndeny?\\n26. Everyone upon it is perishing.\\n27. But will remain the Presence of your Lord, \\nFull of Majesty and Splendor.\\n28. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you \\ndeny?\\n29. Everyone in the heavens and the earth asks \\nHim. Every day He is managing.\\n30. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you \\ndeny?\\n31. We will attend to you, O prominent two.\\n32. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you \\ndeny?\\n33. O society of jinn and humans! If you can \\npass through the bounds of the heavens and \\nthe earth, go ahead and pass. But you will not \\npass except with authorization.\\n34. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you \\ndeny?\\n35. You will be bombarded with flares of fire \\nand brass, and you will not succeed.\\n36. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you \\ndeny?\\n37. When the sky splits apart, and becomes \\nrose, like paint.\\n38. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you \\ndeny?\\n39. On that Day, no human and no jinn will be \\nasked about his sins.\\n40. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you \\ndeny?\\n41. The guilty will be recognized by their \\nmarks; they will be taken by the forelocks and \\nthe feet.\\n42. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you \\ndeny?\\n43. This is Hell that the guilty denied.\\n44. They circulate between it and between a \\nseething bath.\\n45. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you \\ndeny?\\n46. But for him who feared the standing of his \\nLord are two gardens.\\n47. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you \\ndeny?\\n48. Full of varieties.\\n49. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you \\ndeny?\\n50. In them are two flowing springs.\\n51. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you \\ndeny?\\n52. In them are fruits of every kind, in pairs.\\n53. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you \\ndeny?\\n54. Reclining on furnishings lined with bro\\ufffecade, and the fruits of the two gardens are \\nnear at hand.\\n55. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you \\ndeny?\\n56. In them are maidens restraining their \\nglances, untouched before by any man or \\njinn.\\n57. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you \\ndeny?\\n58. As though they were rubies and corals.\\n59. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you \\ndeny?\\n60. Is the reward of goodness anything but \\ngoodness?\\n61. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you \\ndeny?\\n62. And beneath them are two gardens.\\n63. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you \\ndeny?\\n64. Deep green.\\n65. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you \\ndeny?\\n66. In them are two gushing springs.\\n206\\n56. THE INEVITABLE (al-Waqi’ah)\\n67. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you \\ndeny?\\n68. In them are fruits, and date-palms, and \\npomegranates.\\n69. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you \\ndeny?\\n70. In them are good and beautiful ones.\\n71. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you \\ndeny?\\n72. Companions, secluded in the tents.\\n73. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you \\ndeny?\\n74. Whom no human has touched before, nor \\njinn.\\n75. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you \\ndeny?\\n76. Reclining on green cushions, and exquisite \\ncarpets.\\n77. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you \\ndeny?\\n78. Blessed be the name of your Lord, Full of \\nMajesty and Splendor.\\n56. THE INEVITABLE\\n(al-Waqi’ah)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. When the inevitable occurs.\\n2. Of its occurrence, there is no denial.\\n3. Bringing low, raising high.\\n4. When the earth is shaken with a shock.\\n5. And the mountains are crushed and crum\\ufffebled.\\n6. And they become scattered dust.\\n7. And you become three classes.\\n8. Those on the Right—what of those on the \\nRight?\\n9. And those on the Left—what of those on the \\nLeft?\\n10. And the forerunners, the forerunners.\\n11. Those are the nearest.\\n12. In the Gardens of Bliss.\\n13. A throng from the ancients.\\n14. And a small band from the latecomers.\\n15. On luxurious furnishings.\\n16. Reclining on them, facing one another.\\n17. Serving them will be immortalized youth.\\n18. With cups, pitchers, and sparkling drinks.\\n19. Causing them neither headache, nor intox\\ufffeication.\\n20. And fruits of their choice.\\n21. And meat of birds that they may desire.\\n22. And lovely companions.\\n23. The likenesses of treasured pearls.\\n24. As a reward for what they used to do.\\n25. Therein they will hear no nonsense, and no \\naccusations.\\n26. But only the greeting: “Peace, peace.”\\n27. And those on the Right—what of those on \\nthe Right?\\n28. In lush orchards.\\n29. And sweet-smelling plants.\\n30. And extended shade.\\n31. And outpouring water.\\n32. And abundant fruit.\\n33. Neither withheld, nor forbidden.\\n34. And uplifted mattresses.\\n35. We have created them of special creation.\\n36. And made them virgins.\\n37. Tender and un-aging.\\n38. For those on the Right.\\n39. A throng from the ancients.\\n40. And a throng from the latecomers.\\n41. And those on the Left—what of those on \\nthe Left?\\n42. Amid searing wind and boiling water.\\n43. And a shadow of thick smoke.\\n207\\n56. THE INEVITABLE (al-Waqi’ah)\\n44. Neither cool, nor refreshing.\\n45. They had lived before that in luxury.\\n46. And they used to persist in immense \\nwrongdoing.\\n47. And they used to say, “When we are dead \\nand turned into dust and bones, are we to be \\nresurrected?\\n48. And our ancient ancestors too?”\\n49. Say, “The first and the last.\\n50. Will be gathered for the appointment of a \\nfamiliar Day.”\\n51. Then you, you misguided, who deny the \\ntruth.\\n52. Will be eating from the Tree of Bitterness.\\n53. Will be filling your bellies with it.\\n54. Will be drinking on top of it boiling water.\\n55. Drinking like thirsty camels drink. \\n56. That is their hospitality on the Day of Ret\\uffferibution.\\n57. We created you—if only you would be\\ufffelieve!\\n58. Have you seen what you ejaculate?\\n59. Is it you who create it, or are We the Crea\\ufffetor?\\n60. We have decreed death among you, and \\nWe will not be outstripped.\\n61. In replacing you with your likes, and trans\\ufffeforming you into what you do not know.\\n62. You have known the first formation; if only \\nyou would remember.\\n63. Have you seen what you cultivate?\\n64. Is it you who make it grow, or are We the \\nGrower?\\n65. If We will, We can turn it into rubble; then \\nyou will lament.\\n66. “We are penalized.\\n67. No, we are being deprived.”\\n68. Have you seen the water you drink?\\n69. Is it you who sent it down from the clouds, \\nor are We the Sender?\\n70. If We will, We can make it salty. Will you \\nnot be thankful?\\n71. Have you seen the fire you kindle?\\n72. Is it you who produce its tree, or are We \\nthe Producer?\\n73. We have made it a reminder, and a comfort \\nfor the users.\\n74. So glorify the Name of your Great Lord.\\n75. I swear by the locations of the stars.\\n76. It is an oath, if you only knew, that is tre\\ufffemendous.\\n77. It is a noble Quran.\\n78. In a well-protected Book.\\n79. None can grasp it except the purified.\\n80. A revelation from the Lord of the Worlds.\\n81. Is it this discourse that you take so lightly?\\n82. And you make it your livelihood to deny it?\\n83. So when it has reached the throat.\\n84. As you are looking on.\\n85. We are nearer to it than you are, but you \\ndo not see.\\n86. If you are not held to account.\\n87. Then bring it back, if you are truthful.\\n88. But if he is one of those brought near.\\n89. Then happiness, and flowers, and Garden \\nof Delights.\\n90. And if he is one of those on the Right.\\n91. Then, “Peace upon you,” from those on the \\nRight.\\n92. But if he is one of the deniers, the mistaken.\\n93. Then a welcome of Inferno.\\n94. And burning in Hell.\\n95. This is the certain truth.\\n96. So glorify the Name of your Lord, the Mag\\ufffenificent\\n208\\n57. IRON (al-Hadid`)\\n57. IRON\\n(al-Hadid`)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Glorifying Allah is everything in the heav\\ufffeens and the earth. He is the Almighty, the \\nWise.\\n2. To Him belongs the kingdom of the heav\\ufffeens and the earth. He gives life and causes \\ndeath, and He has power over all things.\\n3. He is the First and the Last, and the Outer \\nand the Inner, and He has knowledge of all \\nthings.\\n4. It is He who created the heavens and the \\nearth in six days, then settled over the \\nThrone. He knows what penetrates into the \\nearth, and what comes out of it, and what de\\ufffescends from the sky, and what ascends to it. \\nAnd He is with you wherever you may be. Al\\ufffelah is Seeing of everything you do.\\n5. To Him belongs the kingship of the heavens \\nand the earth, and to Allah all matters are re\\ufffeferred.\\n6. He merges the night into the day, and He\\nmerges the day into the night; and He knows \\nwhat the hearts contains.\\n7. Believe in Allah and His Messenger, and \\nspend from what He made you inherit. Those \\namong you who believe and give will have a \\ngreat reward.\\n8. What is the matter with you that you do not \\nbelieve in Allah, when the Messenger calls \\nyou to believe in your Lord, and He has re\\ufffeceived a pledge from you, if you are believers?\\n9. It is He who sends down upon His servant \\nclear revelations, to bring you out of darkness \\ninto the light. Allah is Gentle towards you, \\nMost Compassionate.\\n10. And why is it that you do not spend in the \\ncause of Allah, when to Allah belongs the in\\ufffeheritance of the heavens and the earth? Not \\nequal among you are those who contributed \\nbefore the conquest, and fought. Those are \\nhigher in rank than those who contributed \\nafterwards, and fought. But Allah promises \\nboth a good reward. Allah is Well Experi\\ufffeenced in what you do.\\n11. Who is he who will lend Allah a loan of \\ngoodness, that He may double it for him, and \\nwill have a generous reward?\\n12. On the Day when you see the believing \\nmen and believing women—their light radi\\ufffeating ahead of them, and to their right: “Good \\nnews for you today: gardens beneath which \\nrivers flow, dwelling therein forever. That is \\nthe great triumph.”\\n13. On the Day when the hypocritical men and \\nhypocritical women will say to those who be\\ufffelieved, “Wait for us; let us absorb some of \\nyour light.” It will be said, “Go back behind \\nyou, and seek light.” A wall will be raised be\\ufffetween them, in which is a door; within it is \\nmercy, and outside it is agony.\\n14. They will call to them, “Were we not with \\nyou?” They will say, “Yes, but you cheated \\nyour souls, and waited, and doubted, and be\\ufffecame deluded by wishful thinking, until the \\ncommand of Allah arrived; and arrogance \\ndeceived you regarding Allah.”\\n15. “Therefore, today no ransom will be ac\\ufffecepted from you, nor from those who disbe\\ufffelieved. The Fire is your refuge. It is your com\\ufffepanion—what an evil fate!”\\n16. Is it not time for those who believe to sur\\uffferender their hearts to the remembrance of Al\\ufffelah, and to the truth that has come down, and \\nnot be like those who were given the Book \\npreviously, but time became prolonged for \\nthem, so their hearts hardened, and many of \\nthem are sinners?\\n17. Know that Allah revives the earth after its \\ndeath. We thus explain the revelations for \\nyou, so that you may understand.\\n18. The charitable men and charitable women, \\nwho have loaned Allah a loan of righteous\\ufffeness—it will be multiplied for them, and for \\nthem is a generous reward.\\n19. Those who believe in Allah and His mes\\ufffesengers—these are the sincere and the wit-\\n209\\n58. THE ARGUMENT (al-Mujadilah)\\nnesses with their Lord; they will have their re\\ufffeward and their light. But as for those who dis\\ufffebelieve and deny Our revelations—these are \\nthe inmates of the Blaze.\\n20. Know that the worldly life is only play, and \\ndistraction, and glitter, and boasting among \\nyou, and rivalry in wealth and children. It is \\nlike a rainfall that produces plants, and de\\ufffelights the disbelievers. But then it withers, \\nand you see it yellowing, and then it becomes \\ndebris. While in the Hereafter there is severe \\nagony, and forgiveness from Allah, and ac\\ufffeceptance. The life of this world is nothing but \\nenjoyment of vanity.\\n21. Race towards forgiveness from your Lord; \\nand a Garden as vast as the heavens and the \\nearth, prepared for those who believe in Allah \\nand His messengers. That is the grace of Al\\ufffelah; He bestows it on whomever He wills. Al\\ufffelah is the Possessor of Immense Grace.\\n22. No calamity occurs on earth, or in your \\nsouls, but it is in a Book, even before We \\nmake it happen. That is easy for Allah.\\n23. That you may not sorrow over what eludes \\nyou, nor exult over what He has given you. \\nAllah does not love the proud snob.\\n24. Those who are stingy, and induce people to \\nbe stingy. Whoever turns away—Allah is the \\nIndependent, the Praiseworthy.\\n25. We sent Our messengers with the clear \\nproofs, and We sent down with them the \\nBook and the Balance, that humanity may \\nuphold justice. And We sent down iron, in \\nwhich is violent force, and benefits for hu\\ufffemanity. That Allah may know who supports \\nHim and His messengers invisibly. Allah is \\nStrong and Powerful.\\n26. We sent Noah and Abraham, and estab\\ufffelished in their line Prophethood and the \\nScripture. Some of them are guided, but \\nmany of them are sinners.\\n27. Then We sent in their wake Our messen\\ufffegers, and followed up with Jesus son of Mary, \\nand We gave him the Gospel, and instilled in \\nthe hearts of those who followed him com\\ufffepassion and mercy. But as for the monasti\\ufffecism which they invented—We did not or\\ufffedain it for them—only to seek Allah’s ap\\ufffeproval. But they did not observe it with its \\ndue observance. So We gave those of them \\nwho believed their reward, but many of them \\nare sinful.\\n28. O you who believe! Fear Allah, and believe \\nin His Messenger: He will give you a double \\nportion of His mercy, and will give you a light \\nby which you walk, and will forgive you. Al\\ufffelah is Forgiving and Merciful.\\n29. That the People of the Book may know that \\nthey have no power whatsoever over Allah’s \\ngrace, and that all grace is in Allah’s hand; He \\ngives it to whomever He wills. Allah is Pos\\ufffesessor of Great Grace.\\n58. THE ARGUMENT\\n(al-Mujadilah)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Allah has heard the statement of she who \\nargued with you concerning her husband, as \\nshe complained to Allah. Allah heard your \\nconversation. Allah is Hearing and Seeing.\\n2. Those of you who estrange their wives by \\nequating them with their mothers—they are \\nnot their mothers. Their mothers are none \\nelse but those who gave birth to them. What \\nthey say is evil, and a blatant lie. But Allah is \\nPardoning and Forgiving.\\n3. Those who estrange their wives by equating \\nthem with their mothers, then go back on \\nwhat they said, must set free a slave before \\nthey may touch one another. To this you are \\nexhorted, and Allah is well aware of what you \\ndo.\\n4. But whoever cannot find the means must \\nfast for two consecutive months before they \\nmay touch one another. And if he is unable, \\nthen the feeding of sixty needy people. This, \\nin order that you affirm your faith in Allah \\nand His Messenger. These are the ordinances \\n210\\n58. THE ARGUMENT (al-Mujadilah)\\nof Allah. The unbelievers will have a painful \\npunishment.\\n5. Those who oppose Allah and His Messen\\ufffeger will be subdued, as those before them \\nwere subdued. We have revealed clear mes\\ufffesages. The unbelievers will have a demeaning \\npunishment.\\n6. On the Day when Allah resurrects them all, \\nand informs them of what they did. Allah has \\nkept count of it, but they have forgotten it. \\nAllah is Witness over everything.\\n7. Do you not realize that Allah knows every\\ufffething in the heavens and everything on earth? \\nThere is no secret counsel between three, but \\nHe is their fourth; nor between five, but He is \\ntheir sixth; nor less than that, nor more, but \\nHe is with them wherever they may be. Then, \\non the Day of Resurrection, He will inform \\nthem of what they did. Allah has knowledge \\nof everything.\\n8. Have you noted those who were prohibited \\nfrom conspiring secretly, but then reverted to \\nwhat they were prohibited from? They con\\ufffespire to commit sin, and aggression, and de\\ufffefiance of the Messenger. And when they \\ncome to you, they greet you with a greeting \\nthat Allah never greeted you with. And they \\nsay within themselves, “Why does Allah not \\npunish us for what we say?” Hell is enough \\nfor them. They will roast in it. What a miser\\ufffeable destiny!\\n9. O you who believe! When you converse se\\ufffecretly, do not converse in sin, and aggression, \\nand disobedience of the Messenger; but con\\ufffeverse in virtue and piety; And fear Allah, to \\nWhom you will be gathered.\\n10. Conspiracies are from Satan, that he may \\ndishearten those who believe; but he will not \\nharm them in the least, except by leave of Al\\ufffelah. So let the believers put their trust in Al\\ufffelah.\\n11. O you who believe! When you are told to \\nmake room in your gatherings, make room; \\nAllah will make room for you. And when you \\nare told to disperse, disperse. Allah elevates \\nthose among you who believe, and those \\ngiven knowledge, many steps. Allah is Aware \\nof what you do.\\n12. O you who believe! When you converse \\nprivately with the Messenger, offer some\\ufffething in charity before your conversation. \\nThat is better for you, and purer. But if you \\ndo not find the means—Allah is Forgiving \\nand Merciful.\\n13. Are you reluctant to offer charity before \\nyour conversation? If you do not do so, and \\nAllah pardons you, then perform the prayer, \\nand give alms, and obey Allah and His Mes\\ufffesenger. Allah is Aware of what you do.\\n14. Have you considered those who befriended \\na people with whom Allah has become angry? \\nThey are not of you, nor of them. And they \\nswear to a lie while they know.\\n15. Allah has prepared for them a terrible pun\\ufffeishment. Evil is what they used to do.\\n16. They took their oaths as a screen, and pre\\ufffevented others from Allah’s path. They will \\nhave a shameful punishment.\\n17. Neither their possessions nor their chil\\ufffedren will avail them anything against Allah. \\nThese are the inhabitants of the Fire, dwelling \\ntherein forever.\\n18. On the Day when Allah will resurrect them \\naltogether—they will swear to Him, as they \\nswear to you, thinking that they are upon \\nsomething. Indeed, they themselves are the \\nliars.\\n19. Satan has taken hold of them, and so has \\ncaused them to forget the remembrance of \\nAllah. These are the partisans of Satan. In\\ufffedeed, it is Satan’s partisans who are the losers.\\n20. Those who oppose Allah and His Messen\\ufffeger are among the lowliest.\\n21. Allah has written: “I will certainly prevail, I \\nand My messengers.” Allah is Strong and \\nMighty.\\n22. You will not find a people who believe in \\nAllah and the Last Day, loving those who op\\ufffepose Allah and His Messenger, even if they \\nwere their parents, or their children, or their \\nsiblings, or their close relatives. These—He \\n211\\n59. THE MOBILIZATION (al-Hashr)\\nhas inscribed faith in their hearts, and has \\nsupported them with a spirit from Him. And \\nHe will admit them into Gardens beneath \\nwhich rivers flow, wherein they will dwell \\nforever. Allah is pleased with them, and they \\nare pleased with Him. These are the partisans \\nof Allah. Indeed, it is Allah’s partisans who \\nare the successful.\\n59. THE MOBILIZATION\\n(al-Hashr)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Glorifying Allah is all that exists in the heav\\ufffeens and the earth. He is the Almighty, the \\nMost Wise.\\n2. It is He who evicted those who disbelieved \\namong the People of the Book from their \\nhomes at the first mobilization. You did not \\nthink they would leave, and they thought \\ntheir fortresses would protect them from Al\\ufffelah. But Allah came at them from where they \\nnever expected, and threw terror into their \\nhearts. They wrecked their homes with their \\nown hands, and by the hands of the believers. \\nTherefore, take a lesson, O you who have in\\ufffesight.\\n3. Had Allah not decreed exile for them, He \\nwould have punished them in this life. But in \\nthe Hereafter they will have the punishment \\nof the Fire.\\n4. That is because they opposed Allah and His \\nMessenger. Whoever opposes Allah—Allah \\nis stern in retribution.\\n5. Whether you cut down a tree, or leave it \\nstanding on its trunk, it is by Allah’s will. He \\nwill surely disgrace the sinners.\\n6. Whatever Allah has bestowed upon His \\nMessenger from them; you spurred neither \\nhorse nor camel for them, but Allah gives au\\ufffethority to His messengers over whomever He \\nwill. Allah is Able to do all things.\\n7. Whatever Allah restored to His Messenger \\nfrom the inhabitants of the villages belongs to \\nAllah, and to the Messenger, and to the rela\\ufffetives, and to the orphans, and to the poor, and \\nto the wayfarer; so that it may not circulate \\nsolely between the wealthy among you. \\nWhatever the Messenger gives you, accept it; \\nand whatever he forbids you, abstain from it. \\nAnd fear Allah. Allah is severe in punish\\ufffement.\\n8. To the poor refugees who were driven out \\nof their homes and their possessions, as they \\nsought the favor of Allah and His approval, \\nand came to the aid of Allah and His Messen\\ufffeger. These are the sincere.\\n9. And those who, before them, had settled in \\nthe homeland, and had accepted faith. They \\nlove those who emigrated to them, and find \\nno hesitation in their hearts in helping them. \\nThey give them priority over themselves, \\neven if they themselves are needy. Whoever \\nis protected from his natural greed—it is they \\nwho are the successful.\\n10. And those who came after them, saying, \\n“Our Lord, forgive us, and our brethren who \\npreceded us in faith, and leave no malice in \\nour hearts towards those who believe. Our \\nLord, You are Clement and Merciful.”\\n11. Have you not considered those who act \\nhypocritically? They say to their brethren \\nwho disbelieved among the People of the \\nBook, “If you are evicted, we will leave with \\nyou, and will not obey anyone against you; \\nand should anyone fight you, we will cer\\ufffetainly support you.” But Allah bears witness \\nthat they are liars.\\n12. If they are evicted, they will not leave with \\nthem; and if anyone fights them, they will not \\nsupport them; and if they go to their aid, they \\nwill turn their backs and flee; then they will \\nreceive no support.\\n13. Fear of you is more intense in their hearts \\nthan fear of Allah. That is because they are a \\npeople who do not understand.\\n14. They will not fight you all together except \\nfrom fortified strongholds, or from behind \\nwalls. Their hostility towards each other is se\\ufffevere. You would think they are united, but \\n212\\n60. THE WOMAN TESTED (al-Mumtahina)\\ntheir hearts are diverse. That is because they \\nare a people who do not understand.\\n15. Like those shortly before them. They expe\\uffferienced the consequences of their decisions. \\nFor them is a painful punishment.\\n16. Like the devil, when he says to the human \\nbeing, “Disbelieve.” But when he has disbe\\ufffelieved, he says, “I am innocent of you; I fear \\nAllah, the Lord of the Worlds.”\\n17. The ultimate end for both of them is the \\nFire, where they will dwell forever. Such is the \\nrequital for the wrongdoers.\\n18. O you who believe! Fear Allah, and let \\nevery soul consider what it has forwarded for \\nthe morrow, and fear Allah. Allah is Aware of \\nwhat you do.\\n19. And do not be like those who forgot Allah, \\nso He made them forget themselves. These \\nare the sinners.\\n20. Not equal are the inhabitants of the Fire \\nand the inhabitants of Paradise. It is the in\\ufffehabitants of Paradise who are the winners.\\n21. Had We sent this Quran down on a moun\\ufffetain, you would have seen it trembling, crum\\ufffebling in awe of Allah. These parables We cite \\nfor the people, so that they may reflect. \\n22. He is Allah. There is no god but He, the \\nKnower of secrets and declarations. He is the \\nCompassionate, the Merciful.\\n23. He is Allah; besides Whom there is no god; \\nthe Sovereign, the Holy, the Peace-Giver, the \\nFaith-Giver, the Overseer, the Almighty, the \\nOmnipotent, the Overwhelming. Glory be to \\nAllah, beyond what they associate.\\n24. He is Allah; the Creator, the Maker, the De\\ufffesigner. His are the Most Beautiful Names. \\nWhatever is in the heavens and the earth glo\\uffferifies Him. He is the Majestic, the Wise.\\n60. THE WOMAN TESTED\\n(al-Mumtahina)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. O you who believe! Do not take My enemies \\nand your enemies for supporters, offering \\nthem affection, when they have disbelieved in \\nwhat has come to you of the Truth. They have \\nexpelled the Messenger, and you, because you \\nbelieved in Allah, your Lord. If you have mo\\ufffebilized to strive for My cause, seeking My ap\\ufffeproval, how can you secretly love them? I \\nknow what you conceal and what you reveal. \\nWhoever among you does that has strayed \\nfrom the right way.\\n2. Whenever they encounter you, they treat \\nyou as enemies, and they stretch their hands \\nand tongues against you with malice. They \\nwish that you would disbelieve.\\n3. Neither your relatives nor your children \\nwill benefit you on the Day of Resurrection. \\nHe will separate between you. Allah is Ob\\ufffeservant of what you do.\\n4. You have had an excellent example in Abra\\ufffeham and those with him; when they said to \\ntheir people, “We are quit of you, and what \\nyou worship apart from Allah. We denounce \\nyou. Enmity and hatred has surfaced between \\nus and you, forever, until you believe in Allah \\nalone.” Except for the words of Abraham to \\nhis father, “I will ask forgiveness for you, \\nthough I have no power from Allah to do an\\ufffeything for you.” “Our Lord, in You we trust, \\nand to You we repent, and to You is the ulti\\ufffemate resort.\\n5. Our Lord, do not make us a target for those \\nwho disbelieve, and forgive us, our Lord. You \\nare indeed the Mighty and Wise.”\\n6. There is an excellent example in them for \\nyou—for anyone who seeks Allah and the \\nLast Day. But whoever turns away—Allah is \\nthe Self-Sufficient, the Most Praised.\\n7. Perhaps Allah will plant affection between \\nyou and those of them you consider enemies. \\nAllah is Capable. Allah is Forgiving and Mer\\ufffeciful.\\n8. As for those who have not fought against \\nyou for your religion, nor expelled you from \\nyour homes, Allah does not prohibit you \\nfrom dealing with them kindly and equitably. \\nAllah loves the equitable.\\n213\\n61. COLUMN (as-Saff)\\n9. But Allah prohibits you from befriending \\nthose who fought against you over your reli\\ufffegion, and expelled you from your homes, and \\naided in your expulsion. Whoever takes them \\nfor friends—these are the wrongdoers.\\n10. O you who believe! When believing \\nwomen come to you emigrating, test them. \\nAllah is Aware of their faith. And if you find \\nthem to be faithful, do not send them back to \\nthe unbelievers. They are not lawful for them, \\nnor are they lawful for them. But give them \\nwhat they have spent. You are not at fault if \\nyou marry them, provided you give them \\ntheir compensation. And do not hold on to \\nties with unbelieving women, but demand \\nwhat you have spent, and let them demand \\nwhat they have spent. This is the rule of Allah; \\nHe rules among you. Allah is Knowing and \\nWise.\\n11. If any of your wives desert you to the unbe\\ufffelievers, and you decide to penalize them, give \\nthose whose wives have gone away the equiv\\ufffealent of what they had spent. And fear Allah, \\nin whom you are believers.\\n12. O prophet! If believing women come to \\nyou, pledging allegiance to you, on condition \\nthat they will not associate anything with Al\\ufffelah, nor steal, nor commit adultery, nor kill \\ntheir children, nor commit perjury as to \\nparenthood, nor disobey you in anything \\nrighteous, accept their allegiance and ask Al\\ufffelah’s forgiveness for them. Allah is Forgiving \\nand Merciful.\\n13. O you who believe! Do not befriend people \\nwith whom Allah has become angry, and \\nhave despaired of the Hereafter, as the faith\\ufffeless have despaired of the occupants of the \\ngraves.\\n61. COLUMN\\n(as-Saff)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Everything in the heavens and the earth \\npraises Allah. He is the Almighty, the Wise.\\n2. O you who believe! Why do you say what \\nyou do not do?\\n3. It is most hateful to Allah that you say what \\nyou do not do.\\n4. Allah loves those who fight in His cause, in \\nranks, as though they were a compact struc\\ufffeture.\\n5. When Moses said to his people, “O my peo\\ufffeple, why do you hurt me, although you know \\nthat I am Allah’s Messenger to you?” And \\nwhen they swerved, Allah swerved their \\nhearts. Allah does not guide the sinful people.\\n6. And when Jesus son of Mary said, “O Chil\\ufffedren of Israel, I am Allah’s Messenger to you, \\nconfirming what preceded me of the Torah, \\nand announcing good news of a messenger \\nwho will come after me, whose name is Ah\\ufffemad.” But when he showed them the mira\\ufffecles, they said, “This is obvious sorcery.”\\n7. And who is a greater wrongdoer than he \\nwho attributes falsehoods to Allah, when he \\nis being invited to Islam? Allah does not \\nguide the wrongdoing people.\\n8. They want to extinguish Allah’s Light with \\ntheir mouths; but Allah will complete His \\nLight, even though the disbelievers dislike it.\\n9. It is He who sent His Messenger with the \\nguidance and the true religion, to make it \\nprevail over all religions, even though the \\nidolaters dislike it.\\n10. O you who believe! Shall I inform you of a \\ntrade that will save you from a painful tor\\ufffement?\\n11. That you believe in Allah and His Messen\\ufffeger, and strive in the cause of Allah with your \\npossessions and yourselves. That is best for \\nyou, if you only knew.\\n12. He will forgive you your sins; and will ad\\ufffemit you into gardens beneath which rivers \\nflow, and into beautiful mansions in the Gar\\ufffedens of Eden. That is the supreme success.\\n13. And something else you love: support from \\nAllah, and imminent victory. So give good \\nnews to the believers.\\n214\\n62. FRIDAY (al-Jumu’ah)\\n14. O you who believe! Be supporters of Allah, \\nas Jesus son of Mary said to the disciples, \\n“Who are my supporters towards Allah?” \\nThe disciples said, “We are Allah's support\\ufffeers.” So a group of the Children of Israel be\\ufffelieved, while another group disbelieved. We \\nsupported those who believed against their \\nfoe, so they became dominant.\\n62. FRIDAY\\n(al-Jumu’ah)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Everything in the heavens and the earth glo\\uffferifies Allah the Sovereign, the Holy, the Al\\ufffemighty, the Wise.\\n2. It is He who sent among the unlettered a \\nmessenger from themselves; reciting His rev\\ufffeelations to them, and purifying them, and \\nteaching them the Scripture and wisdom; alt\\ufffehough they were in obvious error before that.\\n3. And others from them, who have not yet \\njoined them. He is the Glorious, the Wise.\\n4. That is Allah’s grace, which He grants to \\nwhomever He wills. Allah is Possessor of lim\\ufffeitless grace.\\n5. The example of those who were entrusted \\nwith the Torah, but then failed to uphold it, \\nis like the donkey carrying works of litera\\ufffeture. Miserable is the example of the people \\nwho denounce Allah’s revelations. Allah does \\nnot guide the wrongdoing people.\\n6. Say, “O you who follow Judaism; if you \\nclaim to be the chosen of Allah, to the exclu\\ufffesion of the rest of mankind, then wish for \\ndeath if you are sincere.”\\n7. But they will not wish for it, ever, due to \\nwhat their hands have advanced. Allah knows \\nwell the wrongdoers.\\n8. Say, “The death from which you flee will \\ncatch up with you; then you will be returned \\nto the Knower of the Invisible and the Visible, \\nand He will inform you of what you used to \\ndo.”\\n9. O you who believe! When the call is made \\nfor prayer on Congregation Day, hasten to \\nthe remembrance of Allah, and drop all busi\\ufffeness. That is better for you, if you only knew.\\n10. Then, when the prayer is concluded, dis\\ufffeperse through the land, and seek Allah’s \\nbounty, and remember Allah much, so that \\nyou may prosper.\\n11. Yet whenever they come across some busi\\ufffeness, or some entertainment, they scramble \\ntowards it, and leave you standing. Say, \\n“What is with Allah is better than entertain\\ufffement and business; and Allah is the Best of \\nproviders.”\\n63. THE HYPOCRITES\\n(al-Munafiqun)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. When the hypocrites come to you, they say, \\n“We bear witness that you are Allah’s Mes\\ufffesenger.” Allah knows that you are His Mes\\ufffesenger, and Allah bears witness that the hyp\\ufffeocrites are liars.\\n2. They treat their oaths as a cover, and so they \\nrepel others from Allah’s path. Evil is what \\nthey do.\\n3. That is because they believed, and then dis\\ufffebelieved; so their hearts were sealed, and they \\ncannot understand.\\n4. When you see them, their appearance im\\ufffepresses you. And when they speak, you listen \\nto what they say. They are like propped-up \\ntimber. They think every shout is aimed at \\nthem. They are the enemy, so beware of them. \\nAllah condemns them; how deluded they are!\\n5. And when it is said to them, “Come, the \\nMessenger of Allah will ask forgiveness for \\nyou,” they bend their heads, and you see them \\nturning away arrogantly.\\n6. It is the same for them, whether you ask for\\ufffegiveness for them, or do not ask forgiveness \\nfor them; Allah will not forgive them. Allah \\ndoes not guide the sinful people.\\n215\\n64. GATHERING (at-Taghabun)\\n7. It is they who say: “Do not spend anything \\non those who side with Allah’s Messenger, \\nunless they have dispersed.” To Allah belong \\nthe treasures of the heavens and the earth, but \\nthe hypocrites do not understand.\\n8. They say, “If we return to the City, the more \\npowerful therein will evict the weak.” But \\npower belongs to Allah, and His Messenger, \\nand the believers; but the hypocrites do not \\nknow.\\n9. O you who believe! Let neither your posses\\ufffesions nor your children distract you from the \\nremembrance of Allah. Whoever does that—\\nthese are the losers.\\n10. And give from what We have provided for \\nyou, before death approaches one of you, and \\nhe says, “My Lord, if only You would delay \\nme for a short while, so that I may be charita\\ufffeble, and be one of the righteous.”\\n11. But Allah will not delay a soul when its time \\nhas come. Allah is Informed of what you do.\\n64. GATHERING\\n(at-Taghabun)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Everything in the heavens and the earth \\npraises Allah. To Him belongs the Kingdom, \\nand to Him all praise is due, and He is Able \\nto do all things.\\n2. It is He who created you. Some of you are \\nunbelievers, and some of you are believers. \\nAnd Allah perceives what you do.\\n3. He created the heavens and the earth with \\ntruth, and He designed you, and designed \\nyou well, and to Him is the final return.\\n4. He knows everything in the heavens and the \\nearth, and He knows what you conceal and \\nwhat you reveal. And Allah knows what is \\nwithin the hearts.\\n5. Has the news not reached you, of those who \\ndisbelieved before? They tasted the ill conse\\ufffequences of their conduct, and a painful tor\\ufffement awaits them.\\n6. That is because their messengers came to \\nthem with clear explanations, but they said, \\n“Are human beings going to guide us?” So \\nthey disbelieved and turned away. But Allah \\nis in no need. Allah is Independent and \\nPraiseworthy.\\n7. Those who disbelieve claim that they will \\nnot be resurrected. Say, “Yes indeed, by my \\nLord, you will be resurrected; then you will be \\ninformed of everything you did; and that is \\neasy for Allah.”\\n8. So believe in Allah and His Messenger, and \\nthe Light which We sent down. Allah is \\nAware of everything you do.\\n9. The Day when He gathers you for the Day \\nof Gathering—that is the Day of Mutual Ex\\ufffechange. Whoever believes in Allah and acts \\nwith integrity, He will remit his misdeeds, \\nand will admit him into gardens beneath \\nwhich rivers flow, to dwell therein forever. \\nThat is the supreme achievement.\\n10. But as for those who disbelieve and de\\ufffenounce Our revelations—these are the in\\ufffemates of the Fire, dwelling therein forever; \\nand what a miserable fate!\\n11. No disaster occurs except by Allah’s leave. \\nWhoever believes in Allah, He guides his \\nheart. Allah is Aware of everything.\\n12. So obey Allah, and obey the Messenger. But \\nif you turn away—it is only incumbent on \\nOur Messenger to deliver the clear message.\\n13. Allah, there is no god but He; and in Allah \\nlet the believers put their trust.\\n14. O you who believe! Among your wives and \\nyour children are enemies to you, so beware \\nof them. But if you pardon, and overlook, and \\nforgive—Allah is Forgiver and Merciful.\\n15. Your possessions and your children are a \\ntest, but with Allah is a splendid reward.\\n16. So be conscious of Allah as much as you \\ncan, and listen, and obey, and give for your \\nown good. He who is protected from his stin\\ufffeginess—these are the prosperous.\\n216\\n65. DIVORCE (at-Talaq)\\n17. If you lend Allah a good loan, He will mul\\ufffetiply it for you, and will forgive you. Allah is \\nAppreciative and Forbearing.\\n18. The Knower of the Unseen and the Seen, \\nthe Almighty, the Wise.\\n65. DIVORCE\\n(at-Talaq)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. O Prophet! If any of you divorce women, di\\ufffevorce them during their period of purity, and \\ncalculate their term. And be pious before Al\\ufffelah, your Lord. And do not evict them from \\ntheir homes, nor shall they leave, unless they \\nhave committed a proven adultery. These are \\nthe limits of Allah—whoever oversteps Al\\ufffelah’s limits has wronged his own soul. You \\nnever know; Allah may afterwards bring \\nabout a new situation.\\n2. Once they have reached their term, either \\nretain them honorably, or separate from \\nthem honorably. And call to witness two just \\npeople from among you, and give upright tes\\ufffetimony for Allah. By that is exhorted whoever \\nbelieves in Allah and the Last Day. And who\\ufffeever fears Allah—He will make a way out for \\nhim.\\n3. And will provide for him from where he \\nnever expected. Whoever relies on Allah—\\nHe will suffice him. Allah will accomplish His \\npurpose. Allah has set a measure to all things.\\n4. As for those of your women who have \\nreached menopause, if you have any doubts, \\ntheir term shall be three months—and also \\nfor those who have not menstruated. As for \\nthose who are pregnant, their term shall be \\nuntil they have delivered. Whoever fears Al\\ufffelah—He will make things easy for him.\\n5. This is the ordinance of Allah, which He \\nsent down to you. Whoever fears Allah—He \\nwill remit his sins, and will amplify his re\\ufffeward.\\n6. Allow them to reside where you reside, ac\\ufffecording to your means, and do not harass \\nthem in order to make things difficult for \\nthem. If they are pregnant, spend on them \\nuntil they give birth. And if they nurse your \\ninfant, give them their payment. And con\\ufffeduct your relation in amity. But if you disa\\ufffegree, then let another woman nurse him.\\n7. The wealthy shall spend according to his \\nmeans; and he whose resources are restricted \\nshall spend according to what Allah has given \\nhim. Allah never burdens a soul beyond what \\nHe has given it. Allah will bring ease after \\nhardship.\\n8. How many a town defied the command of \\nits Lord and His messengers? So We held it \\nstrictly accountable, and We punished it with \\na dreadful punishment.\\n9. It tasted the result of its decisions, and the \\noutcome of its decisions was perdition.\\n10. Allah has prepared for them a severe retri\\ufffebution. So beware of Allah, O you who pos\\ufffesess intellect and have faith. Allah has sent \\ndown to you a Reminder.\\n11. A messenger who recites to you Allah’s \\nVerses, clear and distinct, that he may bring \\nthose who believe and work righteousness \\nfrom darkness into light. Whoever believes in \\nAllah and acts with integrity, He will admit \\nhim into gardens beneath which rivers flow, \\ntherein to abide forever. Allah has given him \\nan excellent provision.\\n12. Allah is He Who created seven heavens, \\nand their like of earth. The command de\\ufffescends through them, so that you may know \\nthat Allah is Capable of everything, and that \\nAllah Encompasses everything in knowledge.\\n66. PROHIBITION\\n(at-Tahrim)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. O prophet! Why do you prohibit what Allah \\nhas permitted for you, seeking to please your \\nwives? Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.\\n217\\n67. SOVEREIGNTY (al-Mulk)\\n2. Allah has decreed for you the dissolution of \\nyour oaths. Allah is your Master. He is the \\nAll-Knowing, the Most Wise.\\n3. The Prophet told something in confidence \\nto one of his wives. But when she disclosed it, \\nand Allah made it known to him; he commu\\ufffenicated part of it, and he avoided another \\npart. Then, when he informed her of it, she \\nsaid, “Who informed you of this?” He said, \\n“The All-Knowing, the All-Informed, in\\ufffeformed me.”\\n4. If you repent to Allah, then your hearts have \\nlistened. But if you band together against \\nhim, then Allah is his Ally, as is Gabriel, and \\nthe righteous believers. In addition, the an\\ufffegels will assist him.\\n5. Perhaps, if he divorces you, his Lord will \\ngive him in exchange wives better than you: \\nsubmissive, believing, obedient, penitent, de\\ufffevout, fasting—previously married, or virgins.\\n6. O you who believe! Protect yourselves and \\nyour families from a Fire, whose fuel is people \\nand stones. Over it are angels, fierce and pow\\ufffeerful. They never disobey Allah in anything \\nHe commands them, and they carry out \\nwhatever they are commanded.\\n7. O you who disbelieved! Make no excuses \\ntoday. You are being repaid for what you \\nused to do.\\n8. O you who believe! Repent to Allah with \\nsincere repentance. Perhaps your Lord will \\nremit your sins, and admit you into gardens \\nbeneath which rivers flow, on the Day when \\nAllah will not disappoint the Prophet and \\nthose who believed with him. Their light \\nstreaming before them, and to their right, \\nthey will say, “Our Lord, complete our light \\nfor us, and forgive us; You are capable of all \\nthings.”\\n9. O prophet! Strive hard against the disbe\\ufffelievers and the hypocrites, and be stern with \\nthem. Their abode is Hell. What a miserable \\ndestination!\\n10. Allah illustrates an example of those who \\ndisbelieve: the wife of Noah and the wife of \\nLot. They were under two of Our righteous \\nservants, but they betrayed them. They \\navailed them nothing against Allah, and it \\nwas said, “Enter the Fire with those who are \\nentering.”\\n11. And Allah illustrates an example of those \\nwho believe: the wife of Pharaoh, when she \\nsaid, “My Lord, build for me, with you, a \\nhouse in Paradise, and save me from Pharaoh \\nand his works, and save me from the wrong\\ufffedoing people.”\\n12. And Mary, the daughter of Imran, who \\nguarded her womb, and so We breathed into \\nher of Our Spirit; and she believed in the \\ntruth of her Lord’s Words and His Books, and \\nwas one of the devout.\\n67. SOVEREIGNTY\\n(al-Mulk)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Blessed is He in whose hand is the sover\\ufffeeignty, and Who has power over everything.\\n2. He who created death and life—to test \\nyou—as to which of you is better in conduct. \\nHe is the Almighty, the Forgiving.\\n3. He who created seven heavens in layers. \\nYou see no discrepancy in the creation of the \\nCompassionate. Look again. Can you see any \\ncracks?\\n4. Then look again, and again, and your sight \\nwill return to you dazzled and exhausted.\\n5. We have adorned the lower heaven with \\nlanterns, and made them missiles against the \\ndevils; and We have prepared for them the \\npunishment of the Blaze.\\n6. For those who reject their Lord, there is the \\ntorment of Hell. What an evil destination!\\n7. When they are thrown into it, they will hear \\nit roaring, as it seethes.\\n8. It almost bursts with fury. Every time a \\nbatch is thrown into it, its keepers will ask \\nthem, “Has no warner come to you?”\\n218\\n68. THE PEN (al-Qalam)\\n9. They will say, “Yes, a warner did come to us, \\nbut we disbelieved, and said, ‘Allah did not \\nsend down anything; you are very much mis\\ufffetaken.’”\\n10. And they will say, “Had we listened or rea\\ufffesoned, we would not have been among the in\\ufffemates of the Blaze.”\\n11. So they will acknowledge their sins. So \\naway with the inmates of the Blaze.\\n12. As for those who fear their Lord in secret—\\nfor them is forgiveness and a great reward.\\n13. Whether you keep your words secret, or \\ndeclare them—He is Aware of the inner\\nthoughts.\\n14. Would He not know, He Who created? He \\nis the Refined, the Expert.\\n15. It is He who made the earth manageable for \\nyou, so travel its regions, and eat of His pro\\ufffevisions. To Him is the Resurgence.\\n16. Are you confident that the One in heaven \\nwill not cause the earth to collapse beneath \\nyou as it spins?\\n17. Or are you confident that the One in \\nHeaven will not unleash against you a violent \\nstorm? Then you will know what My warning \\nis like.\\n18. Those before them also denied the truth; \\nand how was My disapproval?\\n19. Have they not seen the birds above them, \\nspreading their wings, and folding them? \\nNone holds them except the Compassionate. \\nHe is Perceiver of everything.\\n20. Or who is this who is a force for you to pro\\ufffetect you against the Compassionate? The dis\\ufffebelievers are in nothing but delusion.\\n21. Or who is this that will provide for you, if \\nHe withholds His provision? Yet they persist \\nin defiance and aversion.\\n22. Is he who walks bent on his own design \\nbetter guided, or he who walks upright on a \\nstraight path?\\n23. Say, “It is He who produced you; and made \\nfor you the hearing, and the vision, and the \\norgans. But rarely do you give thanks.”\\n24. Say, “It is He who scattered you on earth, \\nand to Him you will be rounded up.”\\n25. And they say, “When will this promise be \\nfulfilled, if you are truthful?”\\n26. Say, “Knowledge is with Allah, and I am \\nonly a clear warner.”\\n27. But when they see it approaching, the faces \\nof those who disbelieved will turn gloomy, \\nand it will be said, “This is what you used to \\ncall for.”\\n28. Say, “Have you considered? Should Allah \\nmake me perish, and those with me; or else \\nHe bestows His mercy on us; who will protect \\nthe disbelievers from an agonizing torment?”\\n29. Say, “He is the Compassionate. We have \\nfaith in Him, and in Him we trust. Soon you \\nwill know who is in evident error.”\\n30. Say, “Have you considered? If your water \\ndrains away, who will bring you pure running \\nwater?”\\n68. THE PEN\\n(al-Qalam)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Noon. By the pen, and by what they in\\ufffescribe.\\n2. By the grace of your Lord, you are not in\\ufffesane.\\n3. In fact, you will have a reward that will \\nnever end.\\n4. And you are of a great moral character.\\n5. You will see, and they will see.\\n6. Which of you is the afflicted.\\n7. Your Lord knows best who has strayed from \\nHis path, and He knows best the well-guided.\\n8. So do not obey the deniers.\\n9. They would like you to compromise, so they \\nwould compromise.\\n10. And do not obey any vile swearer.\\n11. Backbiter, spreader of slander.\\n219\\n68. THE PEN (al-Qalam)\\n12. Preventer of good, transgressor, sinner.\\n13. Rude and fake besides.\\n14. Just because he has money and children.\\n15. When Our Verses are recited to him, he \\nsays, “Myths of the ancients!”\\n16. We will brand him on the muzzle.\\n17. We tested them, as We tested the owners of \\nthe garden, when they vowed to harvest it in \\nthe morning.\\n18. Without any reservation.\\n19. But a calamity from your Lord went \\naround it while they slept.\\n20. And in the morning it was as if picked.\\n21. In the morning, they called to one another.\\n22. “Go early to your plantation, if you are go\\ufffeing to harvest.”\\n23. So off they went, murmuring to one an\\ufffeother.\\n24. “No poor person is to enter it upon you to\\ufffeday.”\\n25. And early they went, resolved in intent.\\n26. But when they saw it, they said, “We were \\nwrong.\\n27. We are now deprived.”\\n28. The most reasonable of them said, “Did I \\nnot say to you, ‘if only you would glorify?’”\\n29. They said, “Glory to our Lord—We were \\nindeed in the wrong.”\\n30. Then they turned to one another, blaming \\none another.\\n31. They said, “Woe to us—we were indeed \\ndomineering.\\n32. Perhaps our Lord will give us a better sub\\ufffestitute for it. We are turning to our Lord.”\\n33. Such is the punishment; but the punish\\ufffement of the Hereafter is greater, if they only \\nknew.\\n34. For the righteous are Gardens of Delight \\nwith their Lord.\\n35. Shall We treat the Muslims like the vil\\ufffelains?\\n36. What is the matter with you? How do you \\njudge?\\n37. Or do you have a scripture in which you \\nstudy.\\n38. Wherein there is whatever you choose?\\n39. Or do you have oaths from Us, binding un\\ufffetil the Day of Resurrection, that you will have \\nwhatever you demand?\\n40. Ask them, which of them will guarantee \\nthat.\\n41. Or do they have partners? Then let them \\nproduce their partners, if they are truthful.\\n42. On the Day when the Shin will be exposed, \\nand they will be called to bow down, but they \\nwill be unable.\\n43. Their eyes subdued, shame will cover \\nthem. They were invited to bow down when \\nthey were sound.\\n44. So leave Me to those who reject this dis\\ufffecourse; We will proceed against them gradu\\ufffeally, from where they do not know.\\n45. And I will give them respite. My plan is \\nfirm.\\n46. Or do you ask them for a fee, so they are \\nburdened with debt?\\n47. Or do they know the future, and so they \\nwrite it down?\\n48. So wait patiently for the Decision of your \\nLord, and do not be like the Fellow of the Fish \\nwho cried out in despair.\\n49. Were it not for his Lord’s favor that \\nreached him, he would have been thrown \\ninto the wilderness, fully despised.\\n50. But his Lord chose him, and made him one \\nof the righteous.\\n51. Those who disbelieve almost stab you with \\ntheir glances when they hear the message, \\nand say, “He is crazy!”\\n52. But it is no less than a reminder to all the \\nWorlds.\\n220\\n69. THE REALITY (al-Haqqah)\\n69. THE REALITY\\n(al-Haqqah)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. The Reality.\\n2. What is the Reality?\\n3. What will make you understand what the \\nReality is?\\n4. Thamood and Aad denied the Catastrophe.\\n5. As for Thamood, they were annihilated by \\nthe Overwhelming.\\n6. And as for Aad; they were annihilated by a \\nfurious, roaring wind.\\n7. He unleashed it upon them for seven nights \\nand eight days, in succession. You could see \\nthe people tossed around, as though they \\nwere stumps of hollow palm-trees.\\n8. Can you see any remnant of them?\\n9. Then Pharaoh came, and those before him, \\nand the Overturned Cities steeped in sin.\\n10. But they disobeyed the messenger of their \\nLord, so He seized them with an overpower\\ufffeing grip.\\n11. When the waters overflowed, We carried \\nyou in the cruising ship.\\n12. To make it a lesson for you—so that retain\\ufffeing ears may retain it. \\n13. Then, when the Trumpet is sounded a sin\\ufffegle time. \\n14. And the earth and the mountains are lifted \\nup, and crushed, with a single crush.\\n15. On that Day, the Event will come to pass.\\n16. And the heaven will crack; so on that Day \\nit will be frail.\\n17. And the angels will be ranged around its \\nborders, while eight will be carrying the \\nThrone of your Lord above them that Day.\\n18. On that Day you will be exposed, and no \\nsecret of yours will remain hidden.\\n19. As for him who is given his book in his \\nright hand, he will say, “Here, take my book \\nand read it.\\n20. I knew I would be held accountable.”\\n21. So he will be in pleasant living.\\n22. In a lofty Garden.\\n23. Its pickings are within reach.\\n24. “Eat and drink merrily for what you did in \\nthe days gone by.”\\n25. But as for him who is given his book in his \\nleft hand, he will say, “I wish I was never \\ngiven my book.\\n26. And never knew what my account was.\\n27. If only it was the end.\\n28. My money cannot avail me.\\n29. My power has vanished from me.”\\n30. “Take him and shackle him.\\n31. Then scorch him in the Blaze.\\n32. Then in a chain which length is seventy cu\\ufffebits tie him up.\\n33. For he would not believe in Allah the \\nGreat.\\n34. Nor would he advocate the feeding of the \\ndestitute.\\n35. So he has no friend here today.\\n36. And no food except scum.\\n37. Which only the sinners eat.”\\n38. Indeed, I swear by what you see.\\n39. And by what you do not see.\\n40. It is the speech of a noble messenger.\\n41. And it is not the speech of a poet—little do \\nyou believe.\\n42. Nor is it the speech of a soothsayer—little \\ndo you take heed.\\n43. It is a revelation from the Lord of the \\nWorlds.\\n44. Had he falsely attributed some statements \\nto Us.\\n45. We would have seized him by the right \\narm.\\n221\\n70. WAYS OF ASCENT (al-Ma’arij)\\n46. Then slashed his lifeline.\\n47. And none of you could have restrained Us \\nfrom him.\\n48. Surely, it is a message for the righteous.\\n49. And We know that some of you will reject \\nit.\\n50. And it is surely a source of grief for the un\\ufffebelievers.\\n51. Yet it is the absolute truth.\\n52. So glorify the name of your Lord, the Mag\\ufffenificent.\\n70. WAYS OF ASCENT\\n(al-Ma’arij)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. A questioner questioned the imminent tor\\ufffement.\\n2. For the disbelievers; none can repel it.\\n3. From Allah, Lord of the Ways of Ascent.\\n4. Unto Him the angels and the Spirit ascend \\non a Day the duration of which is fifty thou\\ufffesand years.\\n5. So be patient, with sweet patience.\\n6. They see it distant.\\n7. But We see it near.\\n8. On the Day when the sky will be like molten \\nbrass.\\n9. And the mountains will be like tufted wool.\\n10. No friend will care about his friend.\\n11. They will be shown each other. The crimi\\ufffenal wishes he would be redeemed from the \\npunishment of that Day by his children.\\n12. And his spouse, and his brother.\\n13. And his family that sheltered him.\\n14. And everyone on earth, in order to save \\nhim.\\n15. By no means! It is a Raging Fire.\\n16. It strips away the scalps.\\n17. It invites him who once turned his back \\nand fled.\\n18. And accumulated and hoarded.\\n19. Man was created restless.\\n20. Touched by adversity, he is fretful.\\n21. Touched by good, he is ungenerous.\\n22. Except the prayerful.\\n23. Those who are constant at their prayers.\\n24. And those in whose wealth is a rightful \\nshare.\\n25. For the beggar and the deprived.\\n26. And those who affirm the Day of Judg\\ufffement.\\n27. And those who fear the punishment of \\ntheir Lord.\\n28. Their Lord’s punishment is not to be taken \\nfor granted.\\n29. And those who guard their chastity.\\n30. Except from their spouses or those living \\nunder their control, for then they are free of \\nblame.\\n31. But whoever seeks to go beyond that—\\nthese are the transgressors.\\n32. And those who honor their trusts and their \\npledges.\\n33. And those who stand by their testimonies.\\n34. And those who are dedicated to their pray\\ufffeers.\\n35. These will be honored in Gardens.\\n36. What is with those who disbelieve, stretch\\ufffeing their necks towards you.\\n37. From the right, and from the left, banding \\ntogether?\\n38. Is every one of them aspiring to be admit\\ufffeted into a Garden of Bliss?\\n39. No indeed! We created them from what \\nthey know.\\n40. I swear by the Lord of the Easts and the \\nWests, that We are Able.\\n222\\n71. NOAH (Nuh)\\n41. To replace them with better than they, and \\nWe are not to be outdone.\\n42. So leave them to blunder and play, until \\nthey meet their Day which they are promised.\\n43. The Day when they will emerge from the \\ntombs in a rush, as though they were hurry\\ufffeing towards a target.\\n44. Their eyes cast down; overwhelmed by hu\\ufffemiliation. This is the Day which they were \\npromised.\\n71. NOAH\\n(Nuh)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. We sent Noah to his people: “Warn your \\npeople before there comes upon them a pain\\ufffeful punishment.”\\n2. He said, “O my people, I am to you a clear \\nwarner.\\n3. Worship Allah and reverence Him, and \\nobey me.\\n4. And He will forgive you of your sins, and \\nreprieve you until a stated term. Allah’s term \\ncannot be deferred once it has arrived, if you \\nonly knew.”\\n5. He said, “My Lord, I have called my people \\nnight and day.\\n6. But my call added only to their flight.\\n7. Whenever I called them to Your for\\ufffegiveness, they thrust their fingers into their \\nears, and wrapped themselves in their gar\\ufffements, and insisted, and became more and \\nmore arrogant.\\n8. Then I called them openly.\\n9. Then I appealed to them publicly, and I \\nspoke to them privately. \\n10. I said, ‘Ask your Lord for forgiveness; He is \\nForgiving.\\n11. He will let loose the sky upon you in tor\\uffferents.\\n12. And provide you with wealth and children, \\nand allot for you gardens, and allot for you \\nrivers.\\n13. What is the matter with you, that you do \\nnot appreciate Allah’s Greatness?\\n14. Although He created you in stages.\\n15. Do you not realize that Allah created seven \\nheavens in layers?\\n16. And He set the moon in their midst for \\nlight, and He made the sun a lamp.\\n17. And Allah germinated you from the earth\\nlike plants.\\n18. Then He will return you into it, and will \\nbring you out again.\\n19. And Allah made the earth a spread for you.\\n20. That you may travel its diverse roads.’”\\n21. Noah said, “My Lord, they have defied me, \\nand followed him whose wealth and children \\nincrease him only in perdition.”\\n22. And they schemed outrageous schemes.\\n23. And they said, “Do not give up your gods; \\ndo not give up Wadd, nor Souwa, nor \\nYaghoos, and Yaooq, and Nassr.\\n24. They have misled many, so do not increase \\nthe wrongdoers except in confusion.”\\n25. Because of their wrongs, they were \\ndrowned, and were hurled into a Fire. They \\ndid not find apart from Allah any helpers.\\n26. Noah said, “My Lord, do not leave of the \\nunbelievers a single dweller on earth.\\n27. If You leave them, they will mislead your \\nservants, and will breed only wicked unbe\\ufffelievers.\\n28. My Lord! Forgive me and my parents, and \\nanyone who enters my home in faith, and all \\nthe believing men and believing women; and \\ndo not increase the wrongdoers except in \\nperdition.”\\n72. THE JINN\\n(al-Jinn)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\n223\\n73. THE ENWRAPPED (al-Muzzammil)\\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Say, “It was revealed to me that a band of \\njinn listened in, and said, ‘We have heard a \\nwondrous Quran.\\n2. It guides to rectitude, so we have believed in \\nit; and we will never associate anyone with \\nour Lord.\\n3. And Exalted is the Grandeur of our Lord—\\nHe never had a mate, nor a child.\\n4. But the fools among us used to say nonsense \\nabout Allah.\\n5. And we thought that humans and jinn \\nwould never utter lies about Allah.\\n6. Some individual humans used to seek \\npower through some individual jinn, but they \\nonly increased them in confusion.\\n7. They thought, as you thought, that Allah \\nwould never resurrect anyone.\\n8. We probed the heaven, and found it filled \\nwith stern guards and projectiles.\\n9. We used to take up positions to listen in; but \\nwhoever listens now finds a projectile in wait \\nfor him.\\n10. We do not know whether ill is intended for \\nthose on earth, or if their Lord intends good\\ufffeness for them.\\n11. Some of us are righteous, but some of us are \\nless than that; we follow divergent paths.\\n12. We realized that we cannot defeat Allah on \\nearth, and that we cannot escape Him by flee\\ufffeing.\\n13. And when we heard the guidance, we be\\ufffelieved in it. Whoever believes in his Lord \\nfears neither loss, nor burden.\\n14. Among us are those who are submitting, \\nand among us are the compromisers. As for \\nthose who have submitted—it is they who \\npursue rectitude.\\n15. But as for the compromisers—they will be \\nfirewood for Hell.’”\\n16. Had they kept true to the Path, We would \\nhave given them plenty water to drink.\\n17. To test them with it. Whoever turns away \\nfrom the remembrance of his Lord, He will \\ndirect him to torment ever mounting.\\n18. The places of worship are for Allah. So do \\nnot call, besides Allah, upon anyone else.\\n19. And when the servant of Allah got up call\\ufffeing on Him, they almost fell on him in a mass.\\n20. Say, “I pray only to my Lord, and I never \\nassociate anyone with Him.”\\n21. Say, “It is not in my power to harm you, nor \\nto bring you to right conduct.”\\n22. Say, “No one can protect me from Allah, \\nand I will not find any refuge except with \\nHim.\\n23. Except for a proclamation from Allah and \\nHis messages. He who defies Allah and His \\nMessenger—for him is the Fire of Hell, in \\nwhich they will dwell forever.”\\n24. Until, when they see what they were prom\\ufffeised, they will know who is weaker in helpers, \\nand fewer in numbers.\\n25. Say, “I do not know whether what you are \\npromised is near, or whether my Lord will ex\\ufffetend it for a period.”\\n26. The Knower of the Invisible; He does not \\ndisclose His Invisible to anyone.\\n27. Except to a Messenger of His choosing. He \\nthen dispatches guards before him and be\\ufffehind him.\\n28. That He may know that they have con\\ufffeveyed the messages of their Lord. He encom\\ufffepasses what they have, and has tallied every\\ufffething by number.\\n73. THE ENWRAPPED\\n(al-Muzzammil)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. O you Enwrapped one.\\n2. Stay up during the night, except a little.\\n3. For half of it, or reduce it a little.\\n224\\n74. THE ENROBED (al-Muddathir)\\n4. Or add to it; and chant the Quran rhythmi\\ufffecally.\\n5. We are about to give you a heavy message.\\n6. The vigil of night is more effective, and bet\\ufffeter suited for recitation.\\n7. In the daytime, you have lengthy work to \\ndo.\\n8. So remember the Name of your Lord, and \\ndevote yourself to Him wholeheartedly.\\n9. Lord of the East and the West. There is no \\ngod but He, so take Him as a Trustee.\\n10. And endure patiently what they say, and \\nwithdraw from them politely.\\n11. And leave Me to those who deny the truth, \\nthose of luxury, and give them a brief respite.\\n12. With Us are shackles, and a Fierce Fire.\\n13. And food that chokes, and a painful pun\\ufffeishment.\\n14. On the Day when the earth and the moun\\ufffetains tremble, and the mountains become \\nheaps of sand.\\n15. We have sent to you a messenger, a witness \\nover you, as We sent to Pharaoh a messenger.\\n16. But Pharaoh defied the Messenger, so We \\nseized him with a terrible seizing.\\n17. So how will you, if you persist in unbelief, \\nsave yourself from a Day which will turn the \\nchildren gray-haired?\\n18. The heaven will shatter thereby. His prom\\ufffeise is always fulfilled.\\n19. This is a reminder. So whoever wills, let \\nhim take a path to his Lord.\\n20. Your Lord knows that you stay up nearly \\ntwo-thirds of the night, or half of it, or one\\ufffethird of it, along with a group of those with \\nyou. Allah designed the night and the day. He \\nknows that you are unable to sustain it, so He \\nhas pardoned you. So read of the Quran what \\nis possible for you. He knows that some of \\nyou may be ill; and others travelling through \\nthe land, seeking Allah’s bounty; and others \\nfighting in Allah’s cause. So read of it what is \\npossible for you, and observe the prayers, and \\ngive regular charity, and lend Allah a gener\\ufffeous loan. Whatever good you advance for \\nyourselves, you will find it with Allah, better \\nand generously rewarded. And seek Allah’s \\nforgiveness, for Allah is Forgiving and Mer\\ufffeciful.\\n74. THE ENROBED\\n(al-Muddathir)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. O you Enrobed one.\\n2. Arise and warn.\\n3. And magnify your Lord.\\n4. And purify your clothes.\\n5.And abandon abominations.\\n6. And show no favor seeking gain.\\n7. And be constant for your Lord.\\n8. When the Trumpet is blown.\\n9. That Day will be a difficult day.\\n10. For the disbelievers—not easy.\\n11. Leave Me to him whom I created alone.\\n12. And gave him vast wealth.\\n13. And children as witnesses.\\n14. And smoothed things for him.\\n15. Then he wants Me to add yet more!\\n16. By no means! He was stubborn towards \\nOur revelations.\\n17. I will exhaust him increasingly.\\n18. He thought and analyzed.\\n19. May he perish, how he analyzed.\\n20. Again: may he perish, how he analyzed.\\n21. Then he looked.\\n22. Then he frowned and whined.\\n23. Then he turned back and was proud.\\n24. And said, “This is nothing but magic from \\nthe past.\\n25. This is nothing but the word of a mortal.”\\n225\\n75. RESURRECTION (al-Qiyamah)\\n26. I will roast him in Saqar.\\n27. But what will explain to you what Saqar is?\\n28. It neither leaves, nor spares.\\n29. It scorches the flesh.\\n30. Over it are Nineteen.\\n31. We have appointed only angels to be war\\ufffedens of the Fire, and caused their number to \\nbe a stumbling block for those who disbe\\ufffelieve; so that those given the Scripture may \\nattain certainty; and those who believe may \\nincrease in faith; and those given the Scrip\\ufffeture and the believers may not doubt; and \\nthose in whose hearts is sickness and the un\\ufffebelievers may say, “What did Allah intend by \\nthis parable?” Thus Allah leads astray whom \\nHe wills, and guides whom He wills. None \\nknows the soldiers of your Lord except He. \\nThis is nothing but a reminder for the mor\\ufffetals.\\n32. Nay! By the moon.\\n33. And the night as it retreats.\\n34. And the morning as it lights up.\\n35. It is one of the greatest.\\n36. A warning to the mortals.\\n37. To whomever among you wishes to ad\\ufffevance, or regress.\\n38. Every soul is hostage to what it has earned.\\n39. Except for those on the Right.\\n40. In Gardens, inquiring.\\n41. About the guilty.\\n42. “What drove you into Saqar?”\\n43. They will say, “We were not of those who \\nprayed.\\n44. Nor did we feed the destitute.\\n45. And we used to indulge with those who in\\ufffedulge.\\n46. And we used to deny the Day of Judgment.\\n47. Until the Inevitable came upon us.”\\n48. But the intercession of intercessors will not \\nhelp them. \\n49. Why are they turning away from the Re\\ufffeminder?\\n50. As though they were panicked donkeys.\\n51. Fleeing from a lion?\\n52. Yet every one of them desires to be given \\nscrolls unrolled.\\n53. No indeed! But they do not fear the Here\\ufffeafter.\\n54. Nevertheless, it is a reminder.\\n55. So whoever wills, shall remember it.\\n56. But they will not remember, unless Allah \\nwills. He is the Source of Righteousness, and \\nthe Source of Forgiveness.\\n75. RESURRECTION\\n(al-Qiyamah)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. I swear by the Day of Resurrection.\\n2. And I swear by the blaming soul.\\n3. Does man think that We will not reassem\\ufffeble his bones?\\n4. Yes indeed; We are Able to reconstruct his \\nfingertips.\\n5. But man wants to deny what is ahead of \\nhim.\\n6. He asks, “When is the Day of Resurrec\\ufffetion?”\\n7. When vision is dazzled.\\n8. And the moon is eclipsed.\\n9. And the sun and the moon are joined to\\ufffegether.\\n10. On that Day, man will say, “Where is the \\nescape?”\\n11. No indeed! There is no refuge.\\n12. To your Lord on that Day is the settlement.\\n13. On that Day man will be informed of eve\\uffferything he put forward, and everything he left \\nbehind.\\n14. And man will be evidence against himself.\\n226\\n76. MAN (al-Insan)\\n15. Even as he presents his excuses.\\n16. Do not wag your tongue with it, to hurry \\non with it.\\n17. Upon Us is its collection and its recitation.\\n18. Then, when We have recited it, follow its \\nrecitation.\\n19. Then upon Us is its explanation.\\n20. Alas, you love the fleeting life.\\n21. And you disregard the Hereafter.\\n22. Faces on that Day will be radiant.\\n23. Looking towards their Lord.\\n24. And faces on that Day will be gloomy.\\n25. Realizing that a back-breaker has befallen \\nthem.\\n26. Indeed, when it has reached the breast\\ufffebones.\\n27. And it is said, “Who is the healer?”\\n28. And He realizes that it is the parting.\\n29. And leg is entwined with leg.\\n30. To your Lord on that Day is the drive.\\n31. He neither believed nor prayed.\\n32. But he denied and turned away.\\n33. Then he went to his family, full of pride.\\n34. Woe to you; and woe.\\n35. Then again: Woe to you; and woe.\\n36. Does man think that he will be left without \\npurpose?\\n37. Was he not a drop of ejaculated semen?\\n38. Then he became a clot. And He created and \\nproportioned?\\n39. And made of him the two sexes, the male \\nand the female?\\n40. Is He not Able to revive the dead?\\n76. MAN\\n(al-Insan)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Has there come upon man a period of time \\nwhen he was nothing to be mentioned?\\n2. We created man from a liquid mixture, to \\ntest him; and We made him hearing and see\\ufffeing.\\n3. We guided him to the way, be he apprecia\\ufffetive or unappreciative.\\n4. We have prepared for the faithless chains, \\nand yokes, and a Searing Fire.\\n5. But the righteous will drink from a cup \\nwhose mixture is aroma.\\n6. A spring from which the servants of Allah \\nwill drink, making it gush abundantly.\\n7. They fulfill their vows, and dread a Day \\nwhose ill is widespread.\\n8. And they feed, for the love of Him, the poor, \\nand the orphan, and the captive.\\n9. “We only feed you for the sake of Allah. We \\nwant from you neither compensation, nor \\ngratitude.\\n10. We dread from our Lord a frowning grim \\nDay.”\\n11. So Allah will protect them from the ills of \\nthat Day, and will grant them radiance and \\njoy.\\n12. And will reward them for their patience \\nwith a Garden and silk.\\n13. Reclining therein on the thrones; experi\\ufffeencing therein neither sun, nor frost.\\n14. Its shade hovering over them, and its fruit \\nbrought low within reach.\\n15. Passing around them are vessels of silver, \\nand cups of crystal.\\n16. Crystal of silver—they measured them ex\\ufffeactly.\\n17. They will be served therein with a cup \\nwhose flavor is Zanjabeel.\\n18. A spring therein named Salsabeel. \\n19. Passing among them are eternalized \\nyouths. If you see them, you would think \\nthem sprinkled pearls.\\n227\\n77. THE UNLEASHED (al-Mursalat)\\n20. Wherever you look, you see bliss, and a \\nvast kingdom.\\n21. Upon them are garments of green silk, and \\nsatin. And they will be adorned with bracelets \\nof silver. And their Lord will offer them a \\npure drink.\\n22. “This is a reward for you. Your efforts are \\nwell appreciated.”\\n23. It is We who sent down the Quran upon \\nyou—a gradual revelation.\\n24. So be patient for the decision of your Lord, \\nand do not obey the sinner or the blasphemer \\namong them.\\n25. And mention the Name of your Lord, \\nmorning and evening.\\n26. And for part of the night, prostrate yourself \\nto Him, and glorify Him long into the night.\\n27. As for these: they love the fleeting life, and \\nleave behind a Heavy Day.\\n28. We created them, and strengthened their \\nframe; and whenever We will, We can replace \\nthem with others like them.\\n29. This is a reminder; so whoever wills, let \\nhim take a path to his Lord.\\n30. Yet you cannot will, unless Allah wills. Al\\ufffelah is Knowing and Wise.\\n31. He admits into His mercy whomever He \\nwills. But as for the wrongdoers, He has pre\\ufffepared for them a painful punishment.\\n77. THE UNLEASHED\\n(al-Mursalat)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. By those unleashed in succession.\\n2. Storming turbulently.\\n3. Scattering far and wide.\\n4. Separating decisively.\\n5. Delivering a message.\\n6. Excusing or warning.\\n7. Surely what you are promised will happen.\\n8. When the stars are obliterated.\\n9. And the sky is fractured.\\n10. And the mountains are blown away.\\n11. And the messengers are alerted.\\n12. Until which day is it deferred?\\n13. Until the Day of Decision.\\n14. And what will teach you what the Day of \\nDecision is?\\n15. Woe on that Day to the liars. \\n16. Did We not destroy the ancients?\\n17. Then succeeded them with the others?\\n18. This is how We deal with the guilty.\\n19. Woe on that Day to the rejecters.\\n20. Did We not create you from an insignifi\\ufffecant fluid?\\n21. Then lodged it in a secure place?\\n22. For a known term?\\n23. We measured precisely. We are the best to \\nmeasure.\\n24. Woe on that Day to the falsifiers.\\n25. Did We not make the earth a homestead?\\n26. For the living and the dead?\\n27. And set on it lofty mountains, and given \\nyou pure water to drink?\\n28. Woe on that Day to the deniers.\\n29. “Proceed to what you used to deny.”\\n30. “Proceed to a shadow of three different \\nmasses.”\\n31. Offering no shade, and unavailing against \\nthe flames.\\n32. It shoots sparks as castles.\\n33. As if they were yellow camels.\\n34. Woe on that Day to the liars.\\n35. This is a Day when they will not speak.\\n36. And they will not be allowed to apologize.\\n37. Woe on that Day to the rejecters.\\n38. This is the Day of Separation; We have \\ngathered you, together with the ancients.\\n228\\n78. THE EVENT (an-Naba’)\\n39. So if you have a strategy, use it against Me.\\n40. Woe on that Day to the falsifiers.\\n41. The righteous will be amidst shades and \\nfountains.\\n42. And fruits as they desire.\\n43. “Eat and drink pleasantly, for what you \\nused to do.”\\n44. This is how We reward the doers of good.\\n45. Woe on that Day to the deniers.\\n46. “Eat and enjoy yourselves a little; you are \\nindeed criminals.”\\n47. Woe on that Day to the liars.\\n48. And when it is said to them, “Kneel”, they \\ndo not kneel.\\n49. Woe on that Day to the rejecters.\\n50. In what message, beyond this, will they be\\ufffelieve?\\n78. THE EVENT\\n(an-Naba’)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. What are they asking one another about?\\n2. About the Great Event.\\n3. About which they disagree.\\n4. Surely, they will find out.\\n5. Most certainly, they will find out.\\n6. Did We not make the earth a cradle?\\n7. And the mountains pegs?\\n8. And created you in pairs?\\n9. And made your sleep for rest?\\n10. And made the night a cover?\\n11. And made the day for livelihood?\\n12. And built above you seven strong ones?\\n13. And placed a blazing lamp?\\n14. And brought down from the clouds pour\\ufffeing water?\\n15. To produce with it grains and vegetation?\\n16. And luxuriant gardens?\\n17. The Day of Sorting has been appointed.\\n18. The Day when the Trumpet is blown, and \\nyou will come in droves.\\n19. And the sky is opened up, and becomes \\ngateways.\\n20. And the mountains are set in motion, and \\nbecome a mirage.\\n21. Hell is lying in ambush.\\n22. For the oppressors, a destination.\\n23. Where they will remain for eons.\\n24. They will taste therein neither coolness, \\nnor drink.\\n25. Except boiling water, and freezing hail.\\n26. A fitting requital.\\n27. For they were not anticipating any reckon\\ufffeing.\\n28. And they denied Our signs utterly.\\n29. But We have enumerated everything in \\nwriting.\\n30. So taste! We will increase you only in suf\\ufffefering.\\n31. But for the righteous there is triumph.\\n32. Gardens and vineyards.\\n33. And splendid spouses, well matched.\\n34. And delicious drinks.\\n35. They will hear therein neither gossip, nor \\nlies.\\n36. A reward from your Lord, a fitting gift.\\n37. Lord of the heavens and the earth, and eve\\uffferything between them—The Most Merci\\ufffeful—none can argue with Him.\\n38. On the Day when the Spirit and the angels \\nstand in row. They will not speak, unless it be \\none permitted by the Most Merciful, and he \\nwill say what is right.\\n39. That is the Day of Reality. So whoever wills, \\nlet him take a way back to his Lord.\\n40. We have warned you of a near punish\\ufffement—the Day when a person will observe \\n229\\n79. THE SNATCHERS (an-Nazi’at)\\nwhat his hands have produced, and the faith\\ufffeless will say, “O, I wish I were dust.”\\n79. THE SNATCHERS\\n(an-Nazi’at)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. By those who snatch violently.\\n2. And those who remove gently.\\n3. And those who glide smoothly.\\n4. And those who race swiftly.\\n5. And those who regulate events.\\n6. On the Day when the Quake quakes.\\n7. And is followed by the Successor.\\n8. Hearts on that Day will be pounding.\\n9. Their sights downcast.\\n10. They say, “Are we to be restored to the \\noriginal condition?\\n11. When we have become hollow bones?”\\n12. They say, “This is a losing proposition.”\\n13. But it will be only a single nudge.\\n14. And they will be awake.\\n15. Has the story of Moses reached you? \\n16. When His Lord called out to him in the sa\\ufffecred valley of Tuwa.\\n17. “Go to Pharaoh—he has transgressed.”\\n18. And say, “Do you care to be cleansed?\\n19. And I will guide you to your Lord, and you \\nwill turn reverent.”\\n20. He showed him the Greatest Miracle.\\n21. But he denied and defied.\\n22. Then turned his back, and tried.\\n23. And gathered and proclaimed.\\n24. He said, “I am your Lord, the most high.”\\n25. So Allah seized him with an exemplary \\npunishment, in the last and in the first.\\n26. In this is a lesson for whoever fears.\\n27. Are you more difficult to create, or the \\nheaven? He constructed it.\\n28. He raised its masses, and proportioned it.\\n29. And He dimmed its night, and brought out \\nits daylight.\\n30. And the earth after that He spread.\\n31. And from it, He produced its water and its \\npasture.\\n32. And the mountains, He anchored.\\n33. A source of enjoyment for you and for your \\nanimals.\\n34. But when the Great Cataclysm arrives.\\n35. A Day when man will remember what he \\nhas endeavored.\\n36. And Hell will be displayed to whoever sees.\\n37. As for him who was defiant.\\n38. And preferred the life of this world.\\n39. Then Hell is the shelter.\\n40. But as for him who feared the Standing of \\nhis Lord, and restrained the self from desires.\\n41. Then Paradise is the shelter.\\n42. They ask you about the Hour, “When will \\nit take place?”\\n43. You have no knowledge of it.\\n44. To your Lord is its finality.\\n45. You are just a warner for whoever dreads \\nit.\\n46. On the Day when they witness it—as \\nthough they only stayed an evening, or its \\nmorning.\\n80. HE FROWNED\\n(‘Abasa)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. He frowned and turned away.\\n2. When the blind man approached him.\\n3. But how do you know? Perhaps he was \\nseeking to purify himself.\\n230\\n81. THE ROLLING (at-Takwir)\\n4. Or be reminded, and the message would \\nbenefit him.\\n5. But as for him who was indifferent.\\n6. You gave him your attention.\\n7. Though you are not liable if he does not pu\\uffferify himself.\\n8. But as for him who came to you seeking.\\n9. In awe.\\n10. To him you were inattentive.\\n11. Do not. This is a Lesson.\\n12. Whoever wills, shall remember it.\\n13. On honorable pages.\\n14. Exalted and purified.\\n15. By the hands of scribes.\\n16. Noble and devoted.\\n17. Perish man! How thankless he is!\\n18. From what did He create him?\\n19. From a sperm drop He created him, and \\nenabled him.\\n20. Then He eased the way for him.\\n21. Then He puts him to death, and buries \\nhim.\\n22. Then, when He wills, He will resurrect \\nhim.\\n23. But no, he did not fulfill what He has com\\ufffemanded him.\\n24. Let man consider his food.\\n25. We pour down water in abundance.\\n26. Then crack the soil open. \\n27. And grow in it grains.\\n28. And grapes and herbs.\\n29. And olives and dates.\\n30. And luscious gardens.\\n31. And fruits and vegetables.\\n32. Enjoyment for you, and for your livestock.\\n33. But when the Deafening Noise comes to \\npass.\\n34. The Day when a person will flee from his \\nbrother.\\n35. And his mother and his father.\\n36. And his consort and his children.\\n37. Every one of them, on that Day, will have \\nenough to preoccupy him.\\n38. Faces on that Day will be radiant.\\n39. Laughing and rejoicing.\\n40. And Faces on that Day will be covered with \\nmisery.\\n41. Overwhelmed by remorse.\\n42. These are the faithless, the vicious.\\n81. THE ROLLING\\n(at-Takwir)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. When the sun is rolled up.\\n2. When the stars are dimmed.\\n3. When the mountains are set in motion.\\n4. When the relationships are suspended.\\n5. When the beasts are gathered.\\n6. When the oceans are set aflame.\\n7. When the souls are paired.\\n8. When the girl, buried alive, is asked:\\n9. For what crime was she killed?\\n10. When the records are made public.\\n11. When the sky is peeled away.\\n12. When the Fire is set ablaze.\\n13. When Paradise is brought near.\\n14. Each soul will know what it has readied.\\n15. I swear by the galaxies.\\n16. Precisely running their courses.\\n17. And by the night as it recedes.\\n18. And by the morn as it breathes.\\n19. This is the speech of a noble messenger.\\n231\\n82. THE SHATTERING (al-Infitar)\\n20. Endowed with power, eminent with the \\nLord of the Throne. \\n21. Obeyed and honest.\\n22. Your friend is not possessed.\\n23. He saw him on the luminous horizon.\\n24. And He does not withhold knowledge of \\nthe Unseen.\\n25. And it is not the word of an accursed devil.\\n26. So where are you heading?\\n27. It is only a Reminder to all mankind.\\n28. To whoever of you wills to go straight.\\n29. But you cannot will, unless Allah wills—\\nThe Lord of the Worlds.\\n82. THE SHATTERING\\n(al-Infitar)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. When the sky breaks apart.\\n2. When the planets are scattered.\\n3. When the oceans are exploded.\\n4. When the tombs are strewn around.\\n5. Each soul will know what it has advanced, \\nand what it has deferred.\\n6. O man! What deluded you concerning your \\nLord, the Most Generous?\\n7. He Who created you, and formed you, and \\nproportioned you?\\n8. In whatever shape He willed, He assembled \\nyou.\\n9. But you reject the religion.\\n10. Though over you are watchers.\\n11. Honest recorders.\\n12. They know everything you do.\\n13. The virtuous will be in bliss.\\n14. While the wicked will be in Hell.\\n15. They will enter it on the Day of Justice.\\n16. And they will not be absent from it.\\n17. But what will convey to you what the Day \\nof Justice is?\\n18. Then again, what will convey to you what \\nthe Day of Justice is?\\n19. The Day when no soul will avail another \\nsoul anything; and the decision on that Day \\nis Allah’s.\\n83. THE DEFRAUDERS\\n(al-Mutaffifin)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Woe to the defrauders.\\n2. Those who, when they take a measure from \\npeople, they take in full.\\n3. But when they measure or weigh to others, \\nthey cheat.\\n4. Do these not know that they will be resur\\uffferected?\\n5. For a Great Day?\\n6. The Day when mankind will stand before \\nthe Lord of the Worlds?\\n7. Not at all. The record of the wicked is in Sijj\\ufffeeen.\\n8. But how can you know what Sijjeen is?\\n9. A numerical book.\\n10. Woe on that Day to the deniers.\\n11. Those who deny the Day of Reckoning. \\n12. But none denies it except the sinful aggres\\ufffesor.\\n13. When Our revelations are recited to him, \\nhe says, “Legends of the ancients.”\\n14. Not at all. Their hearts have become cor\\uffferoded by what they used to earn.\\n15. Not at all. On that Day, they will be \\nscreened from their Lord.\\n16. Then they will roast in Hell.\\n17. Then it will be said, “This is what you used \\nto deny.”\\n232\\n84. THE RUPTURE (al-Inshiqaq)\\n18. No indeed; the record of the righteous is in \\nElliyyeen.\\n19. But how can you know what Elliyyoon is?\\n20. A numerical book.\\n21. Witnessed by those brought near.\\n22. Indeed, the righteous will be amid bliss.\\n23. On thrones, looking on.\\n24. You will recognize on their faces the radi\\ufffeance of bliss.\\n25. They will be given to drink a sealed wine.\\n26. Whose seal is musk—this is what compet\\ufffeitors should compete for.\\n27. Its mixture is of Tasneem.\\n28. A spring from which those brought near \\ndrink.\\n29. Those who committed crimes used to \\nlaugh at those who believed.\\n30. And when they passed by them, they would \\nwink at one another.\\n31. And when they went back to their families, \\nthey would go back exulting.\\n32. And if they saw them, they would say, \\n“These people are lost.”\\n33. Yet they were not sent as guardians over \\nthem.\\n34. But on that Day, those who believed will \\nlaugh at the unbelievers.\\n35. On luxurious furnishings, looking on.\\n36. Have the unbelievers been repaid for what \\nthey used to do?\\n84. THE RUPTURE\\n(al-Inshiqaq)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. When the sky is ruptured.\\n2. And hearkens to its Lord, as it must.\\n3. And when the earth is leveled out.\\n4. And casts out what is in it, and becomes \\nempty.\\n5. And hearkens to its Lord, as it must.\\n6. O man! You are laboring towards your \\nLord, and you will meet Him.\\n7. As for him who is given his book in his right \\nhand.\\n8. He will have an easy settlement.\\n9. And will return to his family delighted.\\n10. But as for him who is given his book behind \\nhis back.\\n11. He will call for death.\\n12. And will enter the Blaze.\\n13. He used to be happy among his family.\\n14. He thought he would never return.\\n15. In fact, his Lord was watching him.\\n16. I swear by the twilight.\\n17. And by the night, and what it covers.\\n18. And by the moon, as it grows full.\\n19. You will mount stage by stage.\\n20. What is the matter with them that they do \\nnot believe?\\n21. And when the Quran is read to them, they \\ndo not bow down?\\n22. In fact, those who disbelieve are in denial.\\n23. But Allah knows what they hide inside.\\n24. So inform them of a painful punishment.\\n25. Except those who believe and do good \\ndeeds; they will have an undiminished re\\ufffeward.\\n85. THE CONSTELLATIONS\\n(al-Buruj)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. By the sky with the constellations.\\n2. And by the Promised Day.\\n3. And by the witness and the witnessed.\\n233\\n86. THE NIGHTLY VISITOR (at-Tariq)\\n4. Destroyed were the People of the Trench.\\n5. The fire supplied with fuel.\\n6. While they sat around it.\\n7. And were witnessing what they did to the \\nbelievers. \\n8. They begrudged them only because they be\\ufffelieved in Allah the Almighty, the Praisewor\\ufffethy.\\n9. To Whom belongs the sovereignty of the \\nheavens and the earth. Allah is witness over \\neverything.\\n10. Those who tempt the believers, men and \\nwomen, then do not repent; for them is the \\npunishment of Hell; for them is the punish\\ufffement of Burning.\\n11. Those who believe and do righteous deeds \\nwill have Gardens beneath which rivers flow. \\nThat is the great triumph.\\n12. The onslaught of your Lord is severe.\\n13. It is He who begins and repeats.\\n14. And He is the Forgiving, the Loving.\\n15. Possessor of the Glorious Throne.\\n16. Doer of whatever He wills.\\n17. Has there come to you the story of the le\\ufffegions?\\n18. Of Pharaoh and Thamood?\\n19. In fact, those who disbelieve are in denial.\\n20. And Allah encloses them from beyond.\\n21. In fact, it is a Glorious Quran.\\n22. In a Preserved Tablet.\\n86. THE NIGHTLY VISITOR\\n(at-Tariq)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. By the sky and at-Tariq.\\n2. But what will let you know what at-Tariq is?\\n3. The Piercing Star.\\n4. There is no soul without a Protector over it.\\n5. Let man consider what he was created from.\\n6. He was created from gushing liquid.\\n7. Issuing from between the backbone and the \\nbreastbones.\\n8. He is certainly able to return him.\\n9. On the Day when the secrets are disclosed.\\n10. He will have no strength, and no supporter.\\n11. By the sky that returns.\\n12. And the earth that cracks open.\\n13. It is a Decisive Word.\\n14. It is no joke.\\n15. They plot and scheme.\\n16. But I plot and scheme.\\n17. Therefore, give the blasphemers respite, a \\nbrief respite.\\n87. THE MOST HIGH\\n(al-A’la)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Praise the Name of your Lord, the Most \\nHigh.\\n2. He who creates and regulates.\\n3. He who measures and guides.\\n4. He who produces the pasture.\\n5. And then turns it into light debris. \\n6. We will make you read, so do not forget. \\n7. Except what Allah wills. He knows what is \\ndeclared, and what is hidden.\\n8. We will ease you into the Easy Way.\\n9. So remind, if reminding helps.\\n10. The reverent will remember.\\n11. But the wretched will avoid it.\\n12. He who will enter the Gigantic Fire.\\n13. Where he will neither die, nor live.\\n14. Successful is he who purifies himself.\\n234\\n88. THE OVERWHELMING (al-Ghashiyah)\\n15. And mentions the name of his Lord, and \\nprays.\\n16. But you prefer the present life.\\n17. Though the Hereafter is better, and more \\nlasting.\\n18. This is in the former scriptures.\\n19. The Scriptures of Abraham and Moses.\\n88. THE OVERWHELMING\\n(al-Ghashiyah)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Has there come to you the news of the over\\ufffewhelming?\\n2. Faces on that Day will be shamed.\\n3. Laboring and exhausted.\\n4. Roasting in a scorching Fire.\\n5. Given to drink from a flaming spring.\\n6. They will have no food except thorns.\\n7. That neither nourishes, nor satisfies hun\\ufffeger.\\n8. Faces on that Day will be joyful.\\n9. Satisfied with their endeavor.\\n10. In a lofty Garden.\\n11. In it you will hear no nonsense.\\n12. In it is a flowing spring.\\n13. In it are raised beds.\\n14. And cups set in place.\\n15. And cushions set in rows.\\n16. And carpets spread around.\\n17. Do they not look at the camels—how they \\nare created?\\n18. And at the sky—how it is raised?\\n19. And at the mountains—how they are in\\ufffestalled?\\n20. And at the earth—how it is spread out?\\n21. So remind. You are only a reminder.\\n22. You have no control over them.\\n23. But whoever turns away and disbelieves.\\n24. Allah will punish him with the greatest \\npunishment.\\n25. To Us is their return.\\n26. Then upon Us rests their reckoning.\\n89. THE DAWN\\n(al-Fajr)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. By the daybreak.\\n2. And ten nights.\\n3. And the even and the odd.\\n4. And the night as it recedes.\\n5. Is there in this an oath for a rational person?\\n6. Have you not seen how your Lord dealt \\nwith Aad?\\n7. Erum of the pillars.\\n8. The like of which was never created in the \\nland.\\n9. And Thamood—those who carved the \\nrocks in the valley.\\n10. And Pharaoh of the Stakes.\\n11. Those who committed excesses in the \\nlands.\\n12. And spread much corruption therein.\\n13. So your Lord poured down upon them a \\nscourge of punishment.\\n14. Your Lord is on the lookout.\\n15. As for man, whenever his Lord tests him, \\nand honors him, and prospers him, he says, \\n“My Lord has honored me.”\\n16. But whenever He tests him, and restricts \\nhis livelihood for him, he says, “My Lord has \\ninsulted me.”\\n17. Not at all. But you do not honor the or\\ufffephan.\\n18. And you do not urge the feeding of the \\npoor.\\n235\\n90. THE LAND (al-Balad)\\n19. And you devour inheritance with all greed.\\n20. And you love wealth with immense love.\\n21. No—when the earth is leveled, pounded, \\nand crushed.\\n22. And your Lord comes, with the angels, row \\nafter row.\\n23. And on that Day, Hell is brought forward. \\nOn that Day, man will remember, but how \\nwill remembrance avail him?\\n24. He will say, “If only I had forwarded for my \\nlife.”\\n25. On that Day, none will punish as He pun\\ufffeishes.\\n26. And none will shackle as He shackles.\\n27. But as for you, O tranquil soul.\\n28. Return to your Lord, pleased and accepted.\\n29. Enter among My servants.\\n30. Enter My Paradise.\\n90. THE LAND\\n(al-Balad)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. I swear by this land.\\n2. And you are a resident of this land.\\n3.And by a father and what he fathered.\\n4. We created man in distress.\\n5. Does he think that no one has power over \\nhim?\\n6. He says, “I have used up so much money.”\\n7. Does he think that no one sees him?\\n8. Did We not give him two eyes?\\n9. And a tongue, and two lips?\\n10. And We showed him the two ways?\\n11. But he did not brave the ascent.\\n12. And what will explain to you what the as\\ufffecent is?\\n13. The freeing of a slave.\\n14. Or the feeding on a day of hunger.\\n15. An orphan near of kin.\\n16. Or a destitute in the dust.\\n17. Then he becomes of those who believe, and \\nadvise one another to patience, and advise \\none another to kindness.\\n18. These are the people of happiness.\\n19. But as for those who defy Our revela\\ufffetions—these are the people of misery.\\n20. Upon them is a padlocked Fire.\\n91. THE SUN\\n(ash-Shams)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. By the sun and its radiance.\\n2. And the moon as it follows it.\\n3. And the day as it reveals it.\\n4. And the night as it conceals it.\\n5. And the sky and He who built it.\\n6. And the earth and He who spread it.\\n7. And the soul and He who proportioned it.\\n8. And inspired it with its wickedness and its \\nrighteousness.\\n9. Successful is he who purifies it.\\n10. Failing is he who corrupts it.\\n11. Thamood denied in its pride.\\n12. When it followed its most wicked.\\n13. The messenger of Allah said to them, “This \\nis the she-camel of Allah, so let her drink.”\\n14. But they called him a liar, and hamstrung \\nher. So their Lord crushed them for their sin, \\nand leveled it.\\n15. And He does not fear its sequel.\\n92. THE NIGHT\\n(al-Layl)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\n236\\n93. MORNING LIGHT (adh-Duha)\\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. By the night as it covers.\\n2. And the day as it reveals.\\n3. And He who created the male and the fe\\ufffemale.\\n4. Your endeavors are indeed diverse.\\n5. As for him who gives and is righteous.\\n6. And confirms goodness.\\n7. We will ease his way towards ease.\\n8. But as for him who is stingy and compla\\ufffecent.\\n9. And denies goodness.\\n10. We will ease his way towards difficulty.\\n11. And his money will not avail him when he \\nplummets.\\n12. It is upon Us to guide.\\n13. And to Us belong the Last and the First.\\n14. I have warned you of a Fierce Blaze.\\n15. None will burn in it except the very wicked.\\n16. He who denies and turns away.\\n17. But the devout will avoid it.\\n18. He who gives his money to become pure.\\n19. Seeking no favor in return.\\n20. Only seeking the acceptance of his Lord, \\nthe Most High.\\n21. And he will be satisfied.\\n93. MORNING LIGHT\\n(adh-Duha)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. By the morning light.\\n2. And the night as it settles.\\n3. Your Lord did not abandon you, nor did He \\nforget.\\n4. The Hereafter is better for you than the \\nFirst.\\n5. And your Lord will give you, and you will \\nbe satisfied.\\n6. Did He not find you orphaned, and shel\\ufffetered you?\\n7.And found you wandering, and guided you?\\n8. And found you in need, and enriched you?\\n9. Therefore, do not mistreat the orphan.\\n10. Nor rebuff the seeker.\\n11. But proclaim the blessings of your Lord.\\n94. THE SOOTHING\\n(ash-Sharh)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Did We not soothe your heart?\\n2. And lift from you your burden.\\n3. Which weighed down your back?\\n4. And raised for you your reputation?\\n5. With hardship comes ease.\\n6. With hardship comes ease.\\n7. When your work is done, turn to devotion.\\n8. And to your Lord turn for everything.\\n95. THE FIG\\n(at-Tin)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. By the fig and the olive.\\n2. And Mount Sinai.\\n3. And this safe land.\\n4. We created man in the best design.\\n5. Then reduced him to the lowest of the low.\\n6. Except those who believe and do righteous \\ndeeds; for them is a reward without end.\\n7. So why do you still reject the religion?\\n8. Is Allah not the Wisest of the wise?\\n237\\n96. CLOT (al-’Alaq)\\n96. CLOT\\n(al-’Alaq)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Read: In the Name of your Lord who cre\\ufffeated.\\n2. Created man from a clot.\\n3. Read: And your Lord is the Most Generous.\\n4. He who taught by the pen.\\n5. Taught man what he never knew.\\n6. In fact, man oversteps all bounds.\\n7. When he considers himself exempt.\\n8. But to your Lord is the return.\\n9. Have you seen him who prevents?\\n10. A servant when he prays?\\n11. Do you think he is upon guidance?\\n12. Or advocates righteousness?\\n13. Do you see how he disbelieved and turned \\naway?\\n14. Does he not know that Allah sees?\\n15. No. If he does not desist, We will drag him \\nby the forelock.\\n16. A deceitful, sinful forelock.\\n17. Let him call on his gang.\\n18. We will call the Guards.\\n19. No, do not obey him; but kneel down, and \\ncome near.\\n97. DECREE\\n(al-Qadr)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. We sent it down on the Night of Decree.\\n2. But what will convey to you what the Night \\nof Decree is?\\n3. The Night of Decree is better than a thou\\ufffesand months.\\n4. In it descend the angels and the Spirit, by \\nthe leave of their Lord, with every command.\\n5. Peace it is; until the rise of dawn.\\n98. CLEAR EVIDENCE\\n(al-Bayyinah)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Those who disbelieved among the People of \\nthe Scripture, and the Polytheists, were not \\napart, until the Clear Evidence came to them.\\n2. A messenger from Allah reciting purified \\nscripts.\\n3. In them are valuable writings.\\n4. Those who were given the Scripture did not \\nsplinter, except after the Clear Evidence came \\nto them.\\n5. They were commanded only to worship Al\\ufffelah, devoting their faith to Him alone, and to \\npractice regular prayer, and to give alms. \\nThat is the upright religion.\\n6. Those who disbelieve among the People of \\nthe Scripture, and the Polytheists, will be in \\nthe Fire of Hell, where they will abide forever. \\nThese are the worst of creatures.\\n7. As for those who believe and lead a right\\ufffeeous life—these are the best of creatures.\\n8. Their reward is with their Lord: Gardens of \\nEternity beneath which rivers flow, where \\nthey will abide forever. Allah is pleased with \\nthem, and they are pleased with Him. That is \\nfor whoever fears His Lord.\\n99. THE QUAKE\\n(az-Zalzalah)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. When the earth is shaken with its quake.\\n2. And the earth brings out its loads.\\n3. And man says, “What is the matter with it?”\\n4. On that Day, it will tell its tales.\\n238\\n100. THE RACERS (al-’Adiyat)\\n5. For your Lord will have inspired it.\\n6. On that Day, the people will emerge in \\ndroves, to be shown their works.\\n7. Whoever has done an atom's weight of good \\nwill see it.\\n8. And whoever has done an atom's weight of \\nevil will see it.\\n100. THE RACERS\\n(al-’Adiyat)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. By the racers panting.\\n2. Igniting sparks.\\n3. Raiding at dawn.\\n4. Raising clouds of dust.\\n5. Storming into the midst.\\n6. Indeed, the human being is ungrateful to his \\nLord.\\n7. And he bears witness to that.\\n8. And he is fierce in his love of wealth.\\n9. Does he not know? When the contents of \\nthe graves are scattered around.\\n10. And the contents of the hearts are ob\\ufffetained.\\n11. Their Lord, on that Day, is fully informed \\nof them.\\n101. THE SHOCKER\\n(al-Qari’ah)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. The Shocker.\\n2. What is the Shocker?\\n3. What will explain to you what the Shocker \\nis?\\n4. The Day when the people will be like scat\\ufffetered moths.\\n5. And the mountains will be like tufted wool.\\n6. As for he whose scales are heavy. \\n7. He will be in a pleasant life.\\n8. But as for he whose scales are light.\\n9. His home is the Abyss.\\n10. Do you know what it is?\\n11. A Raging Fire.\\n102. ABUNDANCE\\n(at-Takathur)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Abundance distracts you.\\n2. Until you visit the graveyards.\\n3. Indeed, you will know. \\n4. Certainly, you will know.\\n5. If you knew with knowledge of certainty.\\n6. You would see the Inferno.\\n7. Then you will see it with the eye of certainty.\\n8. Then, on that Day, you will be questioned \\nabout the Bliss.\\n103. TIME\\n(al-’Asr)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. By Time.\\n2. The human being is in loss.\\n3. Except those who believe, and do good \\nworks, and encourage truth, and recommend \\npatience.\\n104. THE BACKBITER\\n(al-Humazah)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Woe to every slanderer backbiter.\\n239\\n105. THE ELEPHANT (al-Fil)\\n2. Who gathers wealth and counts it over.\\n3. Thinking that his wealth has made him im\\ufffemortal.\\n4. By no means. He will be thrown into the \\nCrusher.\\n5. And what will make you realize what the \\nCrusher is?\\n6. Allah's kindled Fire.\\n7. That laps to the hearts.\\n8. It closes in on them.\\n9. In extended columns.\\n105. THE ELEPHANT\\n(al-Fil)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Have you not considered how your Lord \\ndealt with the People of the Elephant?\\n2. Did He not make their plan go wrong?\\n3. He sent against them swarms of birds.\\n4. Throwing at them rocks of baked clay.\\n5. Leaving them like chewed-up leaves.\\n106. QURAISH\\n(Quraysh)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. For the security of Quraish.\\n2. Their security during winter and summer \\njourneys.\\n3. Let them worship the Lord of this House.\\n4. Who has fed them against hunger, and has \\nsecured them against fear.\\n107. ASSISTANCE\\n(al-Ma’un)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Have you considered him who denies the \\nreligion?\\n2. It is he who mistreats the orphan.\\n3. And does not encourage the feeding of the \\npoor.\\n4. So woe to those who pray.\\n5. Those who are heedless of their prayers.\\n6. Those who put on the appearance.\\n7. And withhold the assistance.\\n108. PLENTY\\n(al-Kawthar)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. We have given you plenty.\\n2. So pray to your Lord and sacrifice.\\n3. He who hates you is the loser.\\n109. THE DISBELIEVERS\\n(al-Kafirun)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Say, “O disbelievers.\\n2. I do not worship what you worship.\\n3. Nor do you worship what I worship.\\n4. Nor do I serve what you serve.\\n5. Nor do you serve what I serve.\\n6. You have your way, and I have my way.”\\n110. VICTORY\\n(an-Nasr)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. When there comes Allah’s victory, and con\\ufffequest.\\n2. And you see the people entering Allah’s re\\ufffeligion in multitudes.\\n240\\n111. THORNS (al-Masad )\\n3. Then celebrate the praise of your Lord, and \\nseek His forgiveness. He is the Accepter of \\nRepentance.\\n111. THORNS\\n(al-Masad )\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Condemned are the hands of Abee Lahab, \\nand he is condemned.\\n2. His wealth did not avail him, nor did what \\nhe acquired.\\n3. He will burn in a Flaming Fire.\\n4. And his wife—the firewood carrier.\\n5. Around her neck is a rope of thorns.\\n112. MONOTHEISM\\n(al-Ikhlas )\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Say, “He is Allah, the One.\\n2. Allah, the Absolute.\\n3. He begets not, nor was He begotten.\\n4. And there is nothing comparable to Him.”\\n113. DAYBREAK\\n(al-Falaq)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Say, “I take refuge with the Lord of Day\\ufffebreak.\\n2. From the evil of what He created.\\n3. And from the evil of the darkness as it gath\\ufffeers.\\n4. And from the evil of those who practice sor\\ufffecery.\\n5. And from the evil of an envious when he \\nenvies.”\\n114. MANKIND\\n(an-Nas)\\nIn the name of Allah, \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful \\n1. Say, “I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind.\\n2. The King of mankind.\\n3. The God of mankind.\\n4. From the evil of the sneaky whisperer.\\n5. Who whispers into the hearts of people.\\n6. From among jinn and among people.”\\n241\", metadata={'source': 'quran.txt'})]"
