“Allah, there is no god but He, the Living, the Eternal. He sent

before it; and He sent down the Torah and the Gospel.”

“When you read the Quran, seek refuge with Allah from 
Satan the outcast. He has no authority over those who 
believe and trust in their Lord. His authority is only over 
those who follow him, and those who associate others 
with Him.”

1. THE OPENING (al-Fatihah)
1. THE OPENING
(al-Fatihah)
1. In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Mer￾ciful.
2. Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds.
3. The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
4. Master of the Day of Judgment.
5. It is You we worship, and upon You we call 
for help.
6. Guide us to the straight path.
7. The path of those You have blessed, not of 
those against whom there is anger, nor of 
those who are misguided.
2. THE HEIFER
(al-Baqarah)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Alif, Lam, Meem.
2. This is the Book in which there is no doubt, 
a guide for the righteous.
3. Those who believe in the unseen, and per￾form the prayers, and give from what We 
have provided for them.
4. And those who believe in what was revealed 
to you, and in what was revealed before you, 
and are certain of the Hereafter.
5. These are upon guidance from their Lord. 
These are the successful.
6. As for those who disbelieve—it is the same 
for them, whether you have warned them, or 
have not warned them—they do not believe.
7. Allah has set a seal on their hearts and on 
their hearing, and over their vision is a veil. 
They will have a severe torment.
8. Among the people are those who say, “We 
believe in Allah and in the Last Day,” but they 
are not believers.
9. They seek to deceive Allah and those who 
believe, but they deceive none but them￾selves, though they are not aware.
10. In their hearts is sickness, and Allah has in￾creased their sickness. They will have a pain￾ful punishment because of their denial.
11. And when it is said to them, “Do not make 
trouble on earth,” they say, “We are only re￾formers.”
12. In fact, they are the troublemakers, but they 
are not aware.
13. And when it is said to them, “Believe as the 
people have believed,” they say, “Shall we be￾lieve as the fools have believed?” In fact, it is 
they who are the fools, but they do not know.
14. And when they come across those who be￾lieve, they say, “We believe”; but when they 
are alone with their devils, they say, “We are 
with you; we were only ridiculing.”
15. It is Allah who ridicules them, and leaves 
them bewildered in their transgression.
16. Those are they who have bartered error for 
guidance; but their trade does not profit 
them, and they are not guided.
17. Their likeness is that of a person who kin￾dled a fire; when it illuminated all around 
him, Allah took away their light, and left 
them in darkness, unable to see. 
18. Deaf, dumb, blind. They will not return.
19. Or like a cloudburst from the sky, in which 
is darkness, and thunder, and lightning. They 
press their fingers into their ears from the 
thunderbolts, in fear of death. But Allah sur￾rounds the disbelievers.
20. The lightning almost snatches their sight 
away. Whenever it illuminates for them, they 
walk in it; but when it grows dark over them, 
they stand still. Had Allah willed, He could 
have taken away their hearing and their sight. 
Allah is capable of everything.
21. O people! Worship your Lord who created 
you and those before you, that you may attain 
piety.
1
2. THE HEIFER (al-Baqarah)
22. He who made the earth a habitat for you, 
and the sky a structure, and sends water 
down from the sky, and brings out fruits 
thereby, as a sustenance for you. Therefore, 
do not assign rivals to Allah while you know.
23. And if you are in doubt about what We 
have revealed to Our servant, then produce a 
chapter like these, and call your witnesses 
apart from Allah, if you are truthful.
24. But if you do not—and you will not—then 
beware the Fire whose fuel is people and 
stones, prepared for the disbelievers.
25. And give good news to those who believe 
and do righteous deeds; that they will have 
gardens beneath which rivers flow. When￾ever they are provided with fruit therefrom as 
sustenance, they will say, “This is what we 
were provided with before,” and they will be 
given the like of it. And they will have pure 
spouses therein, and they will abide therein 
forever.
26. Allah does not shy away from making an 
example of a gnat, or something above it. As 
for those who believe, they know that it is the 
Truth from their Lord. But as for those who 
disbelieve, they say, “What did Allah intend 
by this example?” He leads astray many 
thereby, and He guides many thereby; but He 
misleads thereby only the evildoers.
27. Those who violate Allah’s covenant after its 
confirmation, and sever what Allah has com￾manded to be joined, and commit evil on 
earth. These are the losers. 
28. How can you deny Allah, when you were 
dead and He gave you life, then He will put 
you to death, then He will bring you to life, 
then to Him you will be returned? 
29. It is He who created for you everything on 
earth, then turned to the heaven, and made 
them seven heavens. And He is aware of all 
things.
30. When your Lord said to the angels, “I am 
placing a successor on earth.” They said, 
“Will You place in it someone who will cause 
corruption in it and shed blood, while we de￾clare Your praises and sanctify You?” He 
said, “I know what you do not know.”
31. And He taught Adam the names, all of 
them; then he presented them to the angels, 
and said, “Tell Me the names of these, if you 
are sincere.”
32. They said, “Glory be to You! We have no 
knowledge except what You have taught us. 
It is you who are the Knowledgeable, the 
Wise.”
33. He said, “O Adam, tell them their names.” 
And when he told them their names, He said, 
“Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of 
the heavens and the earth, and that I know 
what you reveal and what you conceal?”
34. And We said to the angels, “Bow down to 
Adam.” They bowed down, except for Satan. 
He refused, was arrogant, and was one of the 
disbelievers.
35. We said, “O Adam, inhabit the Garden, 
you and your spouse, and eat from it freely as 
you please, but do not approach this tree, lest
you become wrongdoers.”
36. But Satan caused them to slip from it, and 
caused them to depart the state they were in. 
We said, “Go down, some of you enemies of 
one another. And you will have residence on 
earth, and enjoyment for a while.”
37. Then Adam received words from his Lord, 
so He relented towards him. He is the Relent￾ing, the Merciful. 
38. We said, “Go down from it, all of you. Yet 
whenever guidance comes to you from Me, 
then whoever follows My guidance—they 
have nothing to fear, nor shall they grieve.
39. But as for those who disbelieve and reject 
Our signs—these are the inmates of the 
Fire—wherein they will remain forever.”
40. O Children of Israel! Remember My bless￾ings which I bestowed upon you, and fulfill 
your pledge to Me, and I will fulfill My pledge 
to you, and fear Me.
41. And believe in what I revealed, confirming 
what is with you; and do not be the first to 
2
2. THE HEIFER (al-Baqarah)
deny it; and do not exchange My revelations 
for a small price; and be conscious of Me.
42. And do not mix truth with falsehood, and 
do not conceal the truth while you know.
43. And attend to your prayers, and practice 
regular charity, and kneel with those who 
kneel.
44. Do you command people to virtuous con￾duct, and forget yourselves, even though you 
read the Scripture? Do you not understand?
45. And seek help through patience and 
prayer. But it is difficult, except for the de￾vout.
46. Those who know that they will meet their 
Lord, and that to Him they will return.
47. O Children of Israel! Remember My favor 
which I bestowed upon you, and I that fa￾vored you over all nations.
48. And beware of a Day when no soul will 
avail another in the least, nor will any inter￾cession be accepted on its behalf, nor will any 
ransom be taken from it, nor will they be 
helped.
49. And recall that We delivered you from the 
people of Pharaoh. They inflicted on you ter￾rible persecution, killing your sons and spar￾ing your women. Therein was a tremendous 
trial from your Lord.
50. And recall that We parted the sea for you, 
so We saved you, and We drowned the peo￾ple of Pharaoh as you looked on.
51. And recall that We appointed for Moses 
forty nights. Then you took to worshiping the 
calf after him, and you turned wicked.
52. Then We pardoned you after that, so that 
you might be grateful.
53. And recall that We gave Moses the Scrip￾ture and the Criterion, so that you may be 
guided.
54. And recall that Moses said to his people, “O 
my people, you have done wrong to your￾selves by worshiping the calf. So repent to 
your Maker, and kill your egos. That would 
be better for you with your Maker.” So He 
turned to you in repentance. He is the Ac￾cepter of Repentance, the Merciful.
55. And recall that you said, “O Moses, we will 
not believe in you unless we see Allah 
plainly.” Thereupon the thunderbolt struck 
you, as you looked on.
56. Then We revived you after your death, so 
that you may be appreciative.
57. And We shaded you with clouds, and We 
sent down to you manna and quails: “Eat of 
the good things We have provided for you.” 
They did not wrong Us, but they used to 
wrong their own souls.
58. And recall that We said, “Enter this town, 
and eat plentifully from it whatever you wish; 
but enter the gate humbly, and say, 'Pardon.' 
We will forgive your sins, and give increase to 
the virtuous.”
59. But the wrongdoers among them substi￾tuted words other than those given to them, 
so We sent down on the wrongdoers a plague 
from heaven, because of their wicked behav￾ior.
60. And recall when Moses prayed for water 
for his people. We said, “Strike the rock with 
your staff.” Thereupon twelve springs gushed 
out from it, and each tribe recognized its 
drinking-place. “Eat and drink from Allah’s 
provision, and do not corrupt the earth with 
disobedience.”
61. And recall when you said, “O Moses, we 
cannot endure one kind of food, so call to 
your Lord to produce for us of what the earth 
grows: of its herbs, and its cucumbers, and its 
garlic, and its lentils, and its onions.” He said, 
“Would you substitute worse for better? Go 
down to Egypt, where you will have what you 
asked for.” They were struck with humilia￾tion and poverty, and incurred wrath from 
Allah. That was because they rejected Allah’s 
revelations and wrongfully killed the proph￾ets. That was because they disobeyed and 
transgressed.
62. Those who believe, and those who are Jew￾ish, and the Christians, and the Sabeans—any 
who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and 
3
2. THE HEIFER (al-Baqarah)
act righteously—will have their reward with 
their Lord; they have nothing to fear, nor will 
they grieve.
63. And recall when We received a pledge 
from you, and raised the Mount above you: 
“Take what We have given you earnestly, and 
remember what is in it, that you may attain 
righteousness.”
64. But after that you turned away. Were it not 
for Allah’s grace and mercy towards you, you 
would have been among the losers.
65. And you surely knew those of you who vi￾olated the Sabbath. We said to them, “Be des￾picable apes!”
66. Thus We made it a deterrent for their gen￾eration, and for subsequent generations, and 
a lesson for the righteous.
67. And recall when Moses said to his people, 
“Allah commands you to sacrifice a heifer.” 
They said, “Do you make a mockery of us?” 
He said, “Allah forbid that I should be so ig￾norant.”
68. They said, “Call upon your Lord to show us 
which one.” He said, “He says she is a heifer, 
neither too old, nor too young, but in be￾tween. So do what you are commanded.”
69. They said, “Call upon your Lord to show us 
what her color is.” He said, “He says she is a 
yellow heifer, bright in color, pleasing to the 
beholders.”
70. They said, “Call upon your Lord to show us 
which one; the heifers look alike to us; and 
Allah willing, we will be guided.”
71. He said, “He says she is a heifer, neither 
yoked to plow the earth, nor to irrigate the 
field; sound without blemish.” They said, 
“Now you have brought the truth.” So they 
slew her; though they almost did not.
72. And recall when you killed a person, and 
disputed in the matter; but Allah was to ex￾pose what you were hiding.
73. We said, “Strike him with part of it.” Thus 
Allah brings the dead to life; and He shows 
you His signs, that you may understand.
74. Then after that your hearts hardened. They 
were as rocks, or even harder. For there are 
some rocks from which rivers gush out, and 
others that splinter and water comes out 
from them, and others that sink in awe of Al￾lah. Allah is not unaware of what you do.
75. Do you hope that they will believe in you, 
when some of them used to hear the Word of 
Allah, and then deliberately distort it, even 
after understanding it?
76. And when they come across those who be￾lieve, they say, “We believe,” but when they 
come together privately, they say, “Will you 
inform them of what Allah has disclosed to 
you, so that they might dispute with you con￾cerning it before your Lord?” Do you not un￾derstand?
77. Do they not know that Allah knows what 
they conceal and what they reveal?
78. And among them are uneducated who 
know the Scripture only through hearsay, 
and they only speculate.
79. So woe to those who write the Scripture 
with their own hands, and then say, “This is 
from Allah,” that they may exchange it for a 
little price. Woe to them for what their hands 
have written, and woe to them for what they 
earn. 
80. And they say, “The Fire will not touch us 
except for a number of days.” Say, “Have you 
received a promise from Allah—Allah never 
breaks His promise—or are you saying about 
Allah what you do not know?”
81. Indeed, whoever commits misdeeds, and 
becomes besieged by his iniquities—these are 
the inmates of the Fire, wherein they will 
dwell forever. 
82. As for those who believe and do righteous 
deeds—these are the inhabitants of Paradise, 
wherein they will dwell forever.
83. We made a covenant with the Children of 
Israel: “Worship none but Allah; and be good 
to parents, and relatives, and orphans, and 
the needy; and speak nicely to people; and 
pray regularly, and give alms.” Then you 
4
2. THE HEIFER (al-Baqarah)
turned away, except for a few of you, recant￾ing.
84. And We made a covenant with you: “You 
shall not shed the blood of your own, nor 
shall you evict your own from your homes.” 
You agreed, and were all witnesses.
85. But here you are, killing your own, and ex￾pelling a group of your own from their 
homes—conspiring against them in wrong￾doing and hostility. And if they come to you 
as captives, you ransom them, although it was 
forbidden to you. Is it that you believe in part 
of the Scripture, and disbelieve in part? What 
is the reward for those among you who do 
that but humiliation in this life? And on the 
Day of Resurrection, they will be assigned to 
the most severe torment. Allah is not una￾ware of what you do. 
86. Those are they who bought the present life 
for the Hereafter, so the punishment will not 
be lightened for them, nor will they be 
helped.
87. We gave Moses the Scripture, and sent a 
succession of messengers after him. And We 
gave Jesus son of Mary the clear proofs, and 
We supported him with the Holy Spirit. Is it 
that whenever a messenger comes to you with 
anything your souls do not desire, you grew 
arrogant, calling some impostors, and killing 
others?
88. And they said, “Our hearts are sealed.” Ra￾ther, Allah has cursed them for their ingrati￾tude. They have little faith.
89. And when a scripture came to them from 
Allah, confirming what they have—although 
previously they were seeking victory against 
those who disbelieved—but when there came 
to them what they recognized, they disbe￾lieved in it. So Allah’s curse is upon the dis￾believers.
90. Miserable is what they sold their souls 
for—rejecting what Allah has revealed, out of 
resentment that Allah would send down His 
grace upon whomever He chooses from 
among His servants. Thus they incurred 
wrath upon wrath. And there is a demeaning 
punishment for the disbelievers. 
91. And when it is said to them, “Believe in 
what Allah has revealed,” they say, “We be￾lieve in what was revealed to us,” and they re￾ject anything beyond that, although it is the 
truth which confirms what they have. Say, 
“Why did you kill Allah’s prophets before, if 
you were believers?”
92. Moses came to you with clear proofs, yet 
you adopted the calf in his absence, and you 
were in the wrong.
93. And We made a covenant with you, and 
raised the Mount above you: “Take what We 
have given you firmly, and listen.” They said, 
“We hear and disobey.” And their hearts be￾came filled with the love of the calf because of 
their disbelief. Say, “Wretched is what your 
faith commands you to do, if you are believ￾ers.” 
94. Say, “If the Final Home with Allah is yours 
alone, to the exclusion of all other people, 
then wish for death if you are sincere.”
95. But they will never wish for it, because of 
what their hands have forwarded. Allah is 
aware of the evildoers.
96. You will find them, of all mankind, the 
most eager for life, even more than the poly￾theists. Every one of them wishes he could 
live a thousand years; but to be granted a long 
life will not nudge him from the punishment. 
Allah is Seeing of what they do.
97. Say, “Whoever is hostile to Gabriel—it is 
he who revealed it to your heart by Allah’s 
leave, confirming what preceded it, and guid￾ance and good news for the believers.”
98. Whoever is hostile to Allah, and His angels, 
and His messengers, and Gabriel, and Mi￾chael—Allah is hostile to the faithless.
99. We have revealed to you clear signs, and 
none rejects them except the sinners.
100. Is it not that whenever they make a cove￾nant, some of them toss it aside? In fact, most 
of them do not believe.
101. And when there came to them a messen￾ger from Allah, confirming what they had, a 
faction of those who were given the Book 
5
2. THE HEIFER (al-Baqarah)
threw the Book of Allah behind their backs, 
as if they do not know.
102. And they followed what the devils taught 
during the reign of Solomon. It was not Solo￾mon who disbelieved, but it was the devils 
who disbelieved. They taught the people 
witchcraft and what was revealed in Babylon 
to the two angels Harut and Marut. They did 
not teach anybody until they had said, “We 
are a test, so do not lose faith.” But they 
learned from them the means to cause sepa￾ration between man and his wife. But they 
cannot harm anyone except with Allah's per￾mission. And they learned what would harm 
them and not benefit them. Yet they knew 
that whoever deals in it will have no share in 
the Hereafter. Miserable is what they sold 
their souls for, if they only knew.
103. Had they believed and been righteous, the 
reward from Allah would have been better, if 
they only knew.
104. O you who believe! Do not say ambiguous 
words, but say words of respect, and listen. 
The disbelievers will have a painful torment.
105. It is never the wish of the disbelievers from 
among the People of the Book, nor of the pol￾ytheists, that any good should be sent down 
to you from your Lord. But Allah chooses for 
His mercy whomever He wills. Allah is Pos￾sessor of Sublime Grace.
106. We never nullify a verse, nor cause it to be 
forgotten, unless We bring one better than it, 
or similar to it. Do you not know that Allah 
is capable of all things?
107. Do you not know that to Allah belongs the 
sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, and 
that apart from Allah you have no guardian 
or helper?
108. Or do you want to question your Messen￾ger as Moses was questioned before? Who￾ever exchanges faith for disbelief has strayed 
from the right path.
109. Many of the People of the Book wish to 
turn you back into unbelievers after you have 
believed, out of envy on their part, after the 
Truth has become clear to them. But pardon 
and overlook, until Allah brings His com￾mand. Allah has power over all things.
110. And perform the prayer, and give alms. 
Whatever good you forward for yourselves, 
you will find it with Allah. Allah is Seeing of 
everything you do.
111. And they say, “None will enter Heaven un￾less he is a Jew or a Christian.” These are their 
wishes. Say, “Produce your proof, if you are 
truthful.”
112. In fact, whoever submits himself to Allah, 
and is a doer of good, will have his reward 
with his Lord—they have nothing to fear, nor 
shall they grieve.
113. The Jews say, “The Christians are not 
based on anything;” and the Christians say, 
“The Jews are not based on anything.” Yet 
they both read the Scripture. Similarly, the ig￾norant said the same thing. Allah will judge 
between them on the Day of Resurrection re￾garding their differences.
114. Who is more unjust than him who forbids 
the remembrance of Allah’s name in places of 
worship, and contributes to their ruin? These 
ought not to enter them except in fear. For 
them is disgrace in this world, and for them 
is a terrible punishment in the Hereafter.
115. To Allah belong the East and the West. 
Whichever way you turn, there is Allah’s 
presence. Allah is Omnipresent and Omnis￾cient.
116. And they say, “Allah has begotten a son.” 
Be He glorified. Rather, His is everything in 
the heavens and the earth; all are obedient to 
Him.
117. Originator of the heavens and the earth. 
Whenever He decrees a thing, He says to it, 
“Be,” and it becomes.
118. Those who do not know say, “If only Allah 
would speak to us, or a sign would come to 
us.” Thus said those who were before them. 
Their hearts are alike. We have made the 
signs clear for people who are certain. 
6
2. THE HEIFER (al-Baqarah)
119. We have sent you with the truth—bring￾ing good news, and giving warnings. You will 
not be questioned about the inmates of Hell.
120. The Jews and the Christians will not ap￾prove of you, unless you follow their creed. 
Say, “Allah’s guidance is the guidance.” 
Should you follow their desires, after the 
knowledge that has come to you, you will 
have in Allah neither guardian nor helper.
121. Those to whom We have given the Scrip￾ture follow it, as it ought to be followed—
these believe in it. But as for those who reject 
it—these are the losers.
122. O Children of Israel! Remember My bless￾ing which I bestowed upon you, and that I 
have favored you over all people.
123. And beware of a Day when no soul will 
avail another soul in any way, and no ransom 
will be accepted from it, and no intercession 
will benefit it, and they will not be helped.
124. And when his Lord tested Abraham with 
certain words, and he fulfilled them. He said, 
“I am making you a leader of humanity.” He 
said, “And my descendants?” He said, “My 
pledge does not include the wrongdoers.”
125. And We made the House a focal point for 
the people, and a sanctuary. Use the shrine of 
Abraham as a place of prayer. And We com￾missioned Abraham and Ishmael, “Sanctify 
My House for those who circle around it, and 
those who seclude themselves in it, and those 
who kneel and prostrate.”
126. When Abraham said, “O My Lord, make 
this a peaceful land, and provide its people 
with fruits—whoever of them believes in Al￾lah and the Last Day.” He said, “And whoever 
disbelieves, I will give him a little enjoyment, 
then I will consign him to the punishment of 
the Fire; how miserable the destiny!”
127. As Abraham raises the foundations of the 
House, together with Ishmael, “Our Lord, ac￾cept it from us, You are the Hearer, the 
Knower.
128. Our Lord, and make us submissive to You, 
and from our descendants a community sub￾missive to You. And show us our rites, and 
accept our repentance. You are the Acceptor 
of Repentance, the Merciful.
129. Our Lord, and raise up among them a 
messenger, of themselves, who will recite to 
them Your revelations, and teach them the 
Book and wisdom, and purify them. You are 
the Almighty, the Wise.”
130. Who would forsake the religion of Abra￾ham, except he who fools himself? We chose 
him in this world, and in the Hereafter he will 
be among the righteous. 
131. When his Lord said to him, “Submit!” He 
said, “I have submitted to the Lord of the 
Worlds.”
132. And Abraham exhorted his sons, and Ja￾cob, “O my sons, Allah has chosen this reli￾gion for you, so do not die unless you have 
submitted.”
133. Or were you witnesses when death ap￾proached Jacob, and he said to his sons, 
“What will you worship after Me?” They said, 
“We will worship your God, and the God of 
your fathers, Abraham, Ishmael, and Isaac; 
One God; and to Him we submit.”
134. That was a community that has passed; for 
them is what they have earned, and for you is 
what you have earned; and you will not be 
questioned about what they used to do.
135. And they say, “Be Jews or Christians, and 
you will be guided.” Say, “Rather, the religion 
of Abraham, the Monotheist; he was not an 
idolater.”
136. Say, “We believe in Allah; and in what was 
revealed to us; and in what was revealed to 
Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, 
and the Patriarchs; and in what was given to 
Moses and Jesus; and in what was given to the 
prophets—from their Lord. We make no dis￾tinction between any of them, and to Him we 
surrender.”
137. If they believe in the same as you have be￾lieved in, then they have been guided. But if 
they turn away, then they are in schism. Allah 
will protect you against them; for He is the 
Hearer, the Knower. 
7
2. THE HEIFER (al-Baqarah)
138. Allah’s coloring. And who gives better col￾oring than Allah? “And we are devoted to 
Him.”
139. Say, “Do you argue with us about Allah, 
when He is our Lord and your Lord, and We 
have our works, and you have your works, 
and we are sincere to Him?”
140. Or do you say that Abraham, Ishmael, 
Isaac, Jacob, and the Patriarchs were Jews or 
Christians? Say, “Do you know better, or Al￾lah?” And who does greater wrong than he 
who conceals a testimony he has from Allah? 
Allah is not unaware of what you do.
141. That was a community that has passed. To 
them is what they have earned, and to you is 
what you have earned. And you will not be 
questioned about what they used to do.
142. The ignorant among the people will say, 
“What has turned them away from the direc￾tion of prayer they once followed?” Say, “To 
Allah belong the East and the West. He 
guides whom He wills to a straight path.”
143. Thus We made you a moderate commu￾nity, that you may be witnesses to humanity, 
and that the Messenger may be a witness to 
you. We only established the direction of 
prayer, which you once followed, that We 
may distinguish those who follow the Mes￾senger from those who turn on their heels. It 
is indeed difficult, except for those whom Al￾lah has guided. But Allah would never let 
your faith go to waste. Allah is Kind towards 
the people, Merciful.
144. We have seen your face turned towards 
the heaven. So We will turn you towards a di￾rection that will satisfy you. So turn your face 
towards the Sacred Mosque. And wherever 
you may be, turn your faces towards it. Those 
who were given the Book know that it is the 
Truth from their Lord; and Allah is not una￾ware of what they do. 
145. Even if you were to bring to those who 
were given the Book every proof, they would 
not follow your direction, nor are you to fol￾low their direction, nor do they follow the di￾rection of one another. And if you were to 
follow their desires, after the knowledge that 
has come to you, you would be in that case 
one of the wrongdoers.
146. Those to whom We have given the Book 
recognize it as they recognize their own chil￾dren. But some of them conceal the truth 
while they know.
147. The truth is from your Lord, so do not be 
a skeptic.
148. To every community is a direction to￾wards which it turns. Therefore, race towards 
goodness. Wherever you may be, Allah will 
bring you all together. Allah is capable of eve￾rything.
149. And wherever you come from, turn your 
face towards the Sacred Mosque. This is the 
truth from your Lord, and Allah is not heed￾less of what you do.
150. And wherever you come from, turn your 
face towards the Sacred Mosque. And wher￾ever you may be, turn your faces towards it. 
So that the people may not have any argu￾ment against you—except those who do 
wrong among them. So do not fear them, but 
fear Me, that I may complete My blessings 
upon you, and that you may be guided.
151. Just as We sent to you a messenger from 
among you, who recites Our revelations to 
you, and purifies you, and teaches you the 
Book and wisdom, and teaches you what you 
did not know.
152. So remember Me, and I will remember 
you. And thank Me, and do not be ungrate￾ful.
153. O you who believe! Seek help through pa￾tience and prayers. Allah is with the steadfast.
154. And do not say of those who are killed in 
the cause of Allah, “Dead.” Rather, they are 
alive, but you do not perceive.
155. We will certainly test you with some fear 
and hunger, and some loss of possessions and 
lives and crops. But give good news to the 
steadfast.
156. Those who, when a calamity afflicts them, 
say, “To Allah we belong, and to Him we will 
return.”
8
2. THE HEIFER (al-Baqarah)
157. Upon these are blessings and mercy from 
their Lord. These are the guided ones. 
158. Safa and Marwa are among the rites of Al￾lah. Whoever makes the Pilgrimage to the 
House, or performs the Umrah, commits no 
error by circulating between them. Whoever 
volunteers good—Allah is Appreciative and 
Cognizant.
159. Those who suppress the proofs and the 
guidance We have revealed, after We have 
clarified them to humanity in the Scripture—
those—Allah curses them, and the cursers 
curse them.
160. Except those who repent, and reform, and 
proclaim. Those—I will accept their repent￾ance. I am the Acceptor of Repentance, the 
Merciful.
161. But as for those who reject faith, and die 
rejecting—those—upon them is the curse of 
Allah, and of the angels, and of all humanity.
162. They will remain under it forever, and the 
torment will not be lightened for them, and 
they will not be reprieved.
163. Your God is one God. There is no god but 
He, the Benevolent, the Compassionate.
164. In the creation of the heavens and the 
earth; in the alternation of night and day; in 
the ships that sail the oceans for the benefit of 
mankind; in the water that Allah sends down 
from the sky, and revives the earth with it af￾ter it had died, and scatters in it all kinds of 
creatures; in the changing of the winds, and 
the clouds disposed between the sky and the 
earth; are signs for people who understand.
165. Yet among the people are those who take 
other than Allah as equals to Him. They love 
them as the love of Allah. But those who be￾lieve have greater love for Allah. If only the 
wrongdoers would realize, when they see the 
torment; that all power is Allah’s, and that Al￾lah is severe in punishment.
166. Those who were followed will then disown 
those who followed them, and they will see 
the retribution, and ties between them will be 
severed.
167. Those who followed will say, “If only we 
can have another chance, we will disown 
them, as they disowned us.” Thus Allah will 
show them their deeds, as regrets to them, 
and they will not come out of the Fire.
168. O people! Eat of what is lawful and good 
on earth, and do not follow the footsteps of 
Satan. He is to you an open enemy.
169. He commands you to do evil and vice, and 
to say about Allah what you do not know.
170. And when it is said to them, “Follow what 
Allah has revealed,” they say, “We will follow 
what we found our ancestors following.” 
Even if their ancestors understood nothing, 
and were not guided?
171. The parable of those who disbelieve is that 
of someone who calls upon someone who 
hears nothing except screaming and yelling. 
Deaf, dumb, and blind—they do not under￾stand.
172. O you who believe! Eat of the good things 
We have provided for you, and give thanks to 
Allah, if it is Him that you serve.
173. He has forbidden you carrion, and blood, 
and the flesh of swine, and what was dedi￾cated to other than Allah. But if anyone is 
compelled, without desiring or exceeding, he 
commits no sin. Allah is Forgiving and Mer￾ciful.
174. Those who conceal what Allah revealed in 
the Book, and exchange it for a small price—
those swallow nothing but fire into their bel￾lies. And Allah will not speak to them on the 
Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them, 
and they will have a painful punishment. 
175. It is they who exchange guidance for error, 
and forgiveness for punishment. But why do 
they insist on the Fire?
176. That is because Allah has revealed the 
Book in truth; and those who differ about the 
Book are in deep discord.
177. Righteousness does not consist of turning 
your faces towards the East and the West. But 
righteous is he who believes in Allah, and the 
Last Day, and the angels, and the Scripture, 
9
2. THE HEIFER (al-Baqarah)
and the prophets. Who gives money, though 
dear, to near relatives, and orphans, and the 
needy, and the homeless, and the beggars, 
and for the freeing of slaves; those who per￾form the prayers, and pay the obligatory 
charity, and fulfill their promise when they 
promise, and patiently persevere in the face 
of persecution, hardship, and in the time of 
conflict. These are the sincere; these are the 
pious.
178. O you who believe! Retaliation for the 
murdered is ordained upon you: the free for 
the free, the slave for the slave, the female for 
the female. But if he is forgiven by his kin, 
then grant any reasonable demand, and pay 
with good will. This is a concession from 
your Lord, and a mercy. But whoever com￾mits aggression after that, a painful torment 
awaits him.
179. There is life for you in retaliation, O peo￾ple of understanding, so that you may refrain.
180. It is decreed for you: when death ap￾proaches one of you, and he leaves wealth, to 
make a testament in favor of the parents and 
the relatives, fairly and correctly—a duty 
upon the righteous. 
181. But whoever changes it after he has heard 
it, the guilt is upon those who change it. Allah 
is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.
182. Should someone suspect bias or injustice 
on the part of a testator, and then reconciles 
between them, he commits no sin. Allah is 
Forgiving and Merciful. 
183. O you who believe! Fasting is prescribed 
for you, as it was prescribed for those before 
you, that you may become righteous.
184. For a specified number of days. But who￾ever among you is sick, or on a journey, then 
a number of other days. For those who are 
able: a ransom of feeding a needy person. But 
whoever volunteers goodness, it is better for 
him. But to fast is best for you, if you only 
knew.
185. Ramadan is the month in which the Quran 
was revealed. Guidance for humanity, and 
clear portents of guidance, and the Criterion. 
Whoever of you witnesses the month, shall 
fast it. But whoever is sick, or on a journey, 
then a number of other days. Allah desires 
ease for you, and does not desire hardship for 
you, that you may complete the number, and 
celebrate Allah for having guided you, so that 
you may be thankful.
186. And when My servants ask you about Me, 
I Am near; I answer the call of the caller when 
he calls on Me. So let them answer Me, and 
have faith in Me, that they may be rightly 
guided.
187. Permitted for you is intercourse with your 
wives on the night of the fast. They are a gar￾ment for you, and you are a garment for 
them. Allah knows that you used to betray 
yourselves, but He turned to you and par￾doned you. So approach them now, and seek 
what Allah has ordained for you, and eat and 
drink until the white streak of dawn can be
distinguished from the black streak. Then 
complete the fast until nightfall. But do not 
approach them while you are in retreat at the 
mosques. These are the limits of Allah, so do 
not come near them. Allah thus clarifies His 
revelations to the people, that they may attain 
piety.
188. And do not consume one another’s wealth 
by unjust means, nor offer it as bribes to the 
officials in order to consume part of other 
people’s wealth illicitly, while you know.
189. They ask you about the crescents. Say, 
“They are timetables for people, and for the 
Hajj.” It is not virtuous that you approach 
homes from their backs, but virtue is to be pi￾ous. So approach homes from their doors, 
and observe Allah, that you may succeed.
190. And fight in the cause of Allah those who 
fight you, but do not commit aggression; Al￾lah does not love the aggressors.
191. And kill them wherever you overtake 
them, and expel them from where they had 
expelled you. Oppression is more serious 
than murder. But do not fight them at the Sa￾cred Mosque, unless they fight you there. If 
they fight you, then kill them. Such is the ret￾ribution of the disbelievers.
10
2. THE HEIFER (al-Baqarah)
192. But if they cease, then Allah is Forgiving 
and Merciful.
193. And fight them until there is no oppres￾sion, and worship becomes devoted to Allah 
alone. But if they cease, then let there be no 
hostility except against the oppressors.
194. The sacred month for the sacred month; 
and sacrilege calls for retaliation. Whoever 
commits aggression against you, retaliate 
against him in the same measure as he has 
committed against you. And be conscious of 
Allah, and know that Allah is with the right￾eous.
195. And spend in the cause of Allah, and do 
not throw yourselves with your own hands 
into ruin, and be charitable. Allah loves the 
charitable.
196. And carry out the Hajj and the Umrah for 
Allah. But if you are prevented, then what￾ever is feasible of offerings. And do not shave 
your heads until the offering has reached its 
destination. Whoever of you is sick, or has an 
injury of the head, then redemption of fast￾ing, or charity, or worship. When you are se￾cure: whoever continues the Umrah until the 
Hajj, then whatever is feasible of offering. But 
if he lacks the means, then fasting for three 
days during the Hajj and seven when you 
have returned, making ten in all. This is for 
he whose household is not present at the Sa￾cred Mosque. And remain conscious of Al￾lah, and know that Allah is stern in retribu￾tion.
197. The Hajj is during specific months. Who￾ever decides to perform the Hajj—there shall 
be no sexual relations, nor misconduct, nor 
quarrelling during the Hajj. And whatever 
good you do, Allah knows it. And take provi￾sions, but the best provision is righteousness. 
And be mindful of Me, O people of under￾standing.
198. You commit no error by seeking bounty 
from your Lord. When you disperse from Ar￾afat, remember Allah at the Sacred Land￾mark. And remember Him as He has guided 
you. Although, before that, you were of those 
astray.
199. Then disperse from where the people dis￾perse, and ask Allah for forgiveness. Allah is 
Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.
200. When you have completed your rites, re￾member Allah as you remember your par￾ents, or even more. Among the people is he 
who says, “Our Lord, give us in this world,” 
yet he has no share in the Hereafter.
201. And among them is he who says, “Our 
Lord, give us goodness in this world, and 
goodness in the Hereafter, and protect us 
from the torment of the Fire.”
202. These will have a share of what they have 
earned. Allah is swift in reckoning.
203. And remember Allah during the desig￾nated days. But whoever hurries on in two 
days commits no wrong, and whoever stays 
on commits no wrong—provided he main￾tains righteousness. And obey Allah, and 
know that to Him you will be gathered.
204. Among the people is he whose speech 
about the worldly life impresses you, and he 
calls Allah to witness what is in his heart, 
while he is the most hostile of adversaries.
205. When he gains power, he strives to spread 
corruption on earth, destroying properties 
and lives. Allah does not like corruption.
206. And when he is told, “Beware of Allah,” 
his pride leads him to more sin. Hell is 
enough for him—a dreadful abode.
207. And among the people is he who sells 
himself seeking Allah’s approval. Allah is 
kind towards the servants. 
208. O you who believe! Enter into submission, 
wholeheartedly, and do not follow the foot￾steps of Satan; he is to you an outright enemy.
209. But if you slip after the proofs have come 
to you, know that Allah is Powerful and Wise.
210. Are they waiting for Allah Himself to 
come to them in the shadows of the clouds, 
together with the angels, and thus the matter 
is settled? All things are returned to Allah.
211. Ask the Children of Israel how many clear 
signs We have given them. Whoever alters 
11
2. THE HEIFER (al-Baqarah)
the blessing of Allah after it has come to 
him—Allah is severe in retribution.
212. Beautified is the life of this world for those 
who disbelieve, and they ridicule those who 
believe. But the righteous will be above them 
on the Day of Resurrection. Allah provides to 
whomever He wills without measure.
213. Humanity used to be one community; 
then Allah sent the prophets, bringing good 
news and giving warnings. And He sent 
down with them the Scripture, with the truth, 
to judge between people regarding their dif￾ferences. But none differed over it except 
those who were given it—after the proofs had 
come to them—out of mutual envy between 
them. Then Allah guided those who believed 
to the truth they had disputed, in accordance 
with His will. Allah guides whom He wills to 
a straight path. 
214. Or do you expect to enter Paradise before 
the example of those who came before you 
had reached you? Adversity and hardship 
had afflicted them, and they were so shaken 
up, that the Messenger and those who be￾lieved with him said, “When is Allah’s vic￾tory?” Indeed, Allah’s victory is near.
215. They ask you what they should give. Say, 
“Whatever charity you give is for the parents, 
and the relatives, and the orphans, and the 
poor, and the wayfarer. Whatever good you 
do, Allah is aware of it.
216. Fighting is ordained for you, even though 
you dislike it. But it may be that you dislike 
something while it is good for you, and it may 
be that you like something while it is bad for 
you. Allah knows, and you do not know.
217. They ask you about fighting during the 
Holy Month. Say, “Fighting during it is de￾plorable; but to bar others from Allah’s path, 
and to disbelieve in Him, and to prevent ac￾cess to the Holy Mosque, and to expel its peo￾ple from it, are more deplorable with Allah. 
And persecution is more serious than killing. 
They will not cease to fight you until they 
turn you back from your religion, if they can. 
Whoever among you turns back from his re￾ligion, and dies a disbeliever—those are they 
whose works will come to nothing, in this life, 
and in the Hereafter. Those are the inmates 
of the Fire, abiding in it forever.
218. Those who believed, and those who mi￾grated and fought for the sake of Allah—
those look forward to Allah’s mercy. Allah is 
Forgiving and Merciful.
219. They ask you about intoxicants and gam￾bling. Say, “There is gross sin in them, and 
some benefits for people, but their sinfulness 
outweighs their benefit.” And they ask you 
about what they should give: say, “The sur￾plus.” Thus Allah explains the revelations to 
you, so that you may think.
220. About this world and the next. And they 
ask you about orphans. Say, “Improvement 
for them is best. And if you intermix with 
them, then they are your brethren.” Allah 
knows the dishonest from the honest. Had 
Allah willed, He could have overburdened 
you. Allah is Mighty and Wise.
221. Do not marry idolatresses, unless they 
have believed. A believing maid is better than 
an idolatress, even if you like her. And do not 
marry idolaters, unless they have believed. A 
believing servant is better than an idolater, 
even if you like him. These call to the Fire, but 
Allah calls to the Garden and to forgiveness, 
by His leave. He makes clear His communi￾cations to the people, that they may be mind￾ful.
222. And they ask you about menstruation: 
say, “It is harmful, so keep away from women 
during menstruation. And do not approach 
them until they have become pure. Once they 
have become pure, approach them in the way 
Allah has directed you.” Allah loves the re￾pentant, and He loves those who keep clean.”
223. Your women are cultivation for you; so 
approach your cultivation whenever you like, 
and send ahead for yourselves. And fear Al￾lah, and know that you will meet Him. And 
give good news to the believers.
224. And do not allow your oaths in Allah's 
name to hinder you from virtue, and right￾eousness, and making peace between people. 
Allah is Listener and Knower.
12
2. THE HEIFER (al-Baqarah)
225. Allah does not hold you responsible for 
your unintentional oaths, but He holds you 
responsible for your intentions. Allah is For￾giving and Forbearing.
226. Those who vow abstinence from their 
wives must wait for four months. But if they 
reconcile—Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
227. And if they resolve to divorce—Allah is 
Hearing and Knowing.
228. Divorced women shall wait by themselves 
for three periods. And it is not lawful for 
them to conceal what Allah has created in 
their wombs, if they believe in Allah and the 
Last Day. Meanwhile, their husbands have 
the better right to take them back, if they de￾sire reconciliation. And women have rights 
similar to their obligations, according to what 
is fair. But men have a degree over them. Al￾lah is Mighty and Wise.
229. Divorce is allowed twice. Then, either 
honorable retention, or setting free kindly. It 
is not lawful for you to take back anything 
you have given them, unless they fear that 
they cannot maintain Allah's limits. If you 
fear that they cannot maintain Allah’s limits, 
then there is no blame on them if she sacri￾fices something for her release. These are Al￾lah’s limits, so do not transgress them. Those 
who transgress Allah’s limits are the unjust.
230. If he divorces her, she shall not be lawful 
for him again until she has married another 
husband. If the latter divorces her, then there 
is no blame on them for reuniting, provided 
they think they can maintain Allah's limits. 
These are Allah’s limits; He makes them clear 
to people who know.
231. When you divorce women, and they have 
reached their term, either retain them amica￾bly, or release them amicably. But do not re￾tain them to hurt them and commit aggres￾sion. Whoever does that has wronged him￾self. And do not take Allah’s revelations for a 
joke. And remember Allah's favor to you, and 
that He revealed to you the Scripture and 
Wisdom to teach you. And fear Allah, and 
know that Allah is aware of everything.
232. When you divorce women, and they have 
reached their term, do not prevent them from 
marrying their husbands, provided they 
agree on fair terms. Thereby is advised who￾ever among you believes in Allah and the Last 
Day. That is better and more decent for you. 
Allah knows, and you do not know.
233. Mothers may nurse their infants for two 
whole years, for those who desire to complete 
the nursing-period. It is the duty of the father 
to provide for them and clothe them in a 
proper manner. No soul shall be burdened 
beyond its capacity. No mother shall be 
harmed on account of her child, and no fa￾ther shall be harmed on account of his child. 
The same duty rests upon the heir. If the cou￾ple desire weaning, by mutual consent and 
consultation, they commit no error by doing 
so. You commit no error by hiring nursing￾mothers, as long as you pay them fairly. And 
be wary of Allah, and know that Allah is See￾ing of what you do.
234. As for those among you who die and leave 
widows behind, their widows shall wait by 
themselves for four months and ten days. 
When they have reached their term, there is 
no blame on you regarding what they might 
honorably do with themselves. Allah is fully 
acquainted with what you do.
235. You commit no error by announcing your 
engagement to women, or by keeping it to 
yourselves. Allah knows that you will be 
thinking about them. But do not meet them 
secretly, unless you have something proper to 
say. And do not confirm the marriage tie un￾til the writing is fulfilled. And know that Al￾lah knows what is in your souls, so beware of 
Him. And know that Allah is Forgiving and 
Forbearing.
236. You commit no error by divorcing women 
before having touched them, or before hav￾ing set the dowry for them. And compensate 
them—the wealthy according to his means, 
and the poor according to his means—with a 
fair compensation, a duty upon the doers of 
good.
13
2. THE HEIFER (al-Baqarah)
237. If you divorce them before you have 
touched them, but after you had set the 
dowry for them, give them half of what you 
specified—unless they forego the right, or the 
one in whose hand is the marriage contract
foregoes it. But to forego is nearer to piety. 
And do not forget generosity between one 
another. Allah is seeing of everything you do.
238. Guard your prayers, and the middle 
prayer, and stand before Allah in devotion.
239. But if you are in fear, then on foot, or rid￾ing. And when you are safe, remember Allah, 
as He taught you what you did not know.
240. Those of you who die and leave wives be￾hind—a will shall provide their wives with 
support for a year, provided they do not 
leave. If they leave, you are not to blame for 
what they do with themselves, provided it is 
reasonable. Allah is Mighty and Wise.
241. And divorced women shall be provided 
for, equitably—a duty upon the righteous.
242. Allah thus explains His revelations to you, 
so that you may understand.
243. Have you not considered those who fled 
their homes, by the thousands, fearful of 
death? Allah said to them, “Die.” Then He re￾vived them. Allah is Gracious towards the 
people, but most people are not appreciative.
244. Fight in the cause of Allah, and know that 
Allah is Hearing and Knowing.
245. Who is he who will offer Allah a generous 
loan, so He will multiply it for him manifold? 
Allah receives and amplifies, and to Him you 
will be returned.
246. Have you not considered the notables of 
the Children of Israel after Moses? When 
they said to a prophet of theirs, “Appoint a 
king for us, and we will fight in the cause of 
Allah.” He said, “Is it possible that, if fighting 
was ordained for you, you would not fight?” 
They said, “Why would we not fight in the 
cause of Allah, when we were driven out of 
our homes, along with our children?” But 
when fighting was ordained for them, they 
turned away, except for a few of them. But Al￾lah is aware of the wrongdoers.
247. Their prophet said to them, “Allah has ap￾pointed Saul to be your king.” They said, 
“How can he have authority over us, when we 
are more worthy of authority than he, and he 
was not given plenty of wealth?” He said, “Al￾lah has chosen him over you, and has in￾creased him in knowledge and stature.” Allah 
bestows His sovereignty upon whomever He 
wills. Allah is Embracing and Knowing.
248. And their prophet said to them, “The 
proof of his kingship is that the Ark will be 
restored to you, bringing tranquility from 
your Lord, and relics left by the family of Mo￾ses and the family of Aaron. It will be carried 
by the angels. In that is a sign for you, if you 
are believers.” 
249. When Saul set out with the troops, he said, 
“Allah will be testing you with a river. Who￾ever drinks from it does not belong with me. 
But whoever does not drink from it, does be￾long with me, except for whoever scoops up 
a little with his hand.” But they drank from it, 
except for a few of them. Then, when he 
crossed it, he and those who believed with 
him, they said, “We have no strength to face 
Goliath and his troops today.” But those who 
knew that they would meet Allah said, “How 
many a small group has defeated a large 
group by Allah’s will. Allah is with the stead￾fast.”
250. And when they confronted Goliath and 
his troops, they said, “Our Lord, pour down 
patience on us, and strengthen our foothold, 
and support us against the faithless people.”
251. And they defeated them by Allah’s leave, 
and David killed Goliath, and Allah gave him 
sovereignty and wisdom, and taught him as 
He willed. Were it not for Allah restraining 
the people, some by means of others, the 
earth would have gone to ruin. But Allah is 
gracious towards mankind.
252. These are Allah’s revelations, which We 
recite to you in truth. You are one of the mes￾sengers.
253. These messengers: We gave some ad￾vantage over others. To some of them Allah 
spoke directly, and some He raised in rank. 
14
2. THE HEIFER (al-Baqarah)
We gave Jesus son of Mary the clear miracles, 
and We strengthened him with the Holy 
Spirit. Had Allah willed, those who succeeded 
them would not have fought one another, af￾ter the clear signs had come to them; but they 
disputed; some of them believed, and some of 
them disbelieved. Had Allah willed, they 
would not have fought one another; but Allah 
does whatever He desires.
254. O you who believe! Spend from what We 
have given you, before a Day comes in which 
there is neither trading, nor friendship, nor 
intercession. The disbelievers are the wrong￾doers.
255. Allah! There is no god except He, the Liv￾ing, the Everlasting. Neither slumber over￾takes Him, nor sleep. To Him belongs every￾thing in the heavens and everything on earth. 
Who is he that can intercede with Him except 
with His permission? He knows what is be￾fore them, and what is behind them; and they 
cannot grasp any of His knowledge, except as 
He wills. His Throne extends over the heav￾ens and the earth, and their preservation does 
not burden Him. He is the Most High, the 
Great. 
256. There shall be no compulsion in religion; 
the right way has become distinct from the 
wrong way. Whoever renounces evil and be￾lieves in Allah has grasped the most trustwor￾thy handle; which does not break. Allah is 
Hearing and Knowing.
257. Allah is the Lord of those who believe; He 
brings them out of darkness and into light. As 
for those who disbelieve, their lords are the 
evil ones; they bring them out of light and 
into darkness—these are the inmates of the 
Fire, in which they will abide forever.
258. Have you not considered him who argued 
with Abraham about his Lord, because Allah 
had given him sovereignty? Abraham said, 
“My Lord is He who gives life and causes 
death.” He said, “I give life and cause death.” 
Abraham said, “Allah brings the sun from the 
East, so bring it from the West,” so the blas￾phemer was confounded. Allah does not 
guide the wrongdoing people.
259. Or like him who passed by a town col￾lapsed on its foundations. He said, “How can 
Allah revive this after its demise?” Thereupon 
Allah caused him to die for a hundred years, 
and then resurrected him. He said, “For how 
long have you tarried?” He said, “I have tar￾ried for a day, or part of a day.” He said, “No. 
You have tarried for a hundred years. Now 
look at your food and your drink—it has not 
spoiled—and look at your donkey. We will 
make you a wonder for mankind. And look 
at the bones, how We arrange them, and then 
clothe them with flesh.” So when it became 
clear to him, he said, “I know that Allah has 
power over all things.” 
260. And when Abraham said, “My Lord, show 
me how You give life to the dead.” He said, 
“Have you not believed?” He said, “Yes, but 
to put my heart at ease.” He said, “Take four 
birds, and incline them to yourself, then place 
a part on each hill, then call to them; and they 
will come rushing to you. And know that Al￾lah is Powerful and Wise.”
261. The parable of those who spend their 
wealth in Allah’s way is that of a grain that 
produces seven spikes; in each spike is a hun￾dred grains. Allah multiplies for whom He 
wills. Allah is Bounteous and Knowing. 
262. Those who spend their wealth in the way 
of Allah, and then do not follow up what they 
spent with reminders of their generosity or 
with insults, will have their reward with their 
Lord—they have nothing to fear, nor shall 
they grieve.
263. Kind words and forgiveness are better 
than charity followed by insults. Allah is Rich 
and Clement.
264. O you who believe! Do not nullify your 
charitable deeds with reminders and hurtful 
words, like him who spends his wealth to be 
seen by the people, and does not believe in 
Allah and the Last Day. His likeness is that of 
a smooth rock covered with soil: a downpour 
strikes it, and leaves it bare—they gain noth￾ing from their efforts. Allah does not guide 
the disbelieving people.
15
2. THE HEIFER (al-Baqarah)
265. And the parable of those who spend their 
wealth seeking Allah’s approval, and to 
strengthen their souls, is that of a garden on 
a hillside. If heavy rain falls on it, its produce 
is doubled; and if no heavy rain falls, then 
dew is enough. Allah is seeing of everything 
you do.
266. Would anyone of you like to have a garden 
of palms and vines, under which rivers 
flow—with all kinds of fruit in it for him, and 
old age has stricken him, and he has weak 
children—then a tornado with fire batters it, 
and it burns down? Thus Allah makes clear 
the signs for you, so that you may reflect.
267. O you who believe! Give of the good 
things you have earned, and from what We 
have produced for you from the earth. And 
do not pick the inferior things to give away, 
when you yourselves would not accept it ex￾cept with eyes closed. And know that Allah is 
Sufficient and Praiseworthy.
268. Satan promises you poverty, and urges 
you to immorality; but Allah promises you 
forgiveness from Himself, and grace. Allah is 
Embracing and Knowing.
269. He gives wisdom to whomever He wills. 
Whoever is given wisdom has been given 
much good. But none pays heed except those 
with insight.
270. Whatever charity you give, or a pledge you 
fulfill, Allah knows it. The wrongdoers have 
no helpers.
271. If you give charity openly, that is good. But 
if you keep it secret, and give it to the needy 
in private, that is better for you. It will atone 
for some of your misdeeds. Allah is cognizant 
of what you do.
272. Their guidance is not your responsibility, 
but Allah guides whom He wills. Any charity 
you give is for your own good. Any charity 
you give shall be for the sake of Allah. Any 
charity you give will be repaid to you in full, 
and you will not be wronged.
273. It is for the poor; those who are restrained 
in the way of Allah, and unable to travel in 
the land. The unaware would think them 
rich, due to their dignity. You will recognize 
them by their features. They do not ask from 
people insistently. Whatever charity you give, 
Allah is aware of it. 
274. Those who spend their wealth by night 
and day, privately and publicly, will receive 
their reward from their Lord. They have 
nothing to fear, nor shall they grieve. 
275. Those who swallow usury will not rise, ex￾cept as someone driven mad by Satan's touch. 
That is because they say, “Commerce is like 
usury.” But Allah has permitted commerce, 
and has forbidden usury. Whoever, on re￾ceiving advice from his Lord, refrains, may 
keep his past earnings, and his case rests with 
Allah. But whoever resumes—these are the 
dwellers of the Fire, wherein they will abide 
forever. 
276. Allah condemns usury, and He blesses 
charities. Allah does not love any sinful in￾grate.
277. Those who believe, and do good deeds, 
and pray regularly, and give charity—they 
will have their reward with their Lord; they 
will have no fear, nor shall they grieve. 
278. O you who believe! Fear Allah, and forgo 
what remains of usury, if you are believers. 
279. If you do not, then take notice of a war by 
Allah and His Messenger. But if you repent, 
you may keep your capital, neither wronging, 
nor being wronged.
280. But if he is in hardship, then deferment 
until a time of ease. But to remit it as charity 
is better for you, if you only knew.
281. And guard yourselves against a Day when 
you will be returned to Allah; then each soul 
will be rewarded fully for what it has earned, 
and they will not be wronged.
282. O you who believe! When you incur debt 
among yourselves for a certain period of 
time, write it down. And have a scribe write 
in your presence, in all fairness. And let no 
scribe refuse to write, as Allah has taught 
him. So let him write, and let the debtor dic￾tate. And let him fear Allah, his Lord, and di￾minish nothing from it. But if the debtor is 
16
3. FAMILY OF IMRAN (Ali ‘Imran)
mentally deficient, or weak, or unable to dic￾tate, then let his guardian dictate with hon￾esty. And call to witness two men from 
among you. If two men are not available, then 
one man and two women whose testimony is 
acceptable to all—if one of them fails to re￾member, the other would remind her. Wit￾nesses must not refuse when called upon. 
And do not think it too trivial to write down, 
whether small or large, including the time of 
repayment. That is more equitable with Al￾lah, and stronger as evidence, and more likely 
to prevent doubt—except in the case of a spot 
transaction between you—then there is no 
blame on you if you do not write it down. 
And let there be witnesses whenever you con￾clude a contract, and let no harm be done to 
either scribe or witness. If you do that, it is 
corruption on your part. And fear Allah. Al￾lah teaches you. Allah is aware of everything.
283. If you are on a journey, and cannot find a 
scribe, then a security deposit should be 
handed over. But if you trust one another, let 
the trustee fulfill his trust, and let him fear Al￾lah, his Lord. And do not conceal testimony. 
Whoever conceals it is sinner at heart. Allah 
is aware of what you do.
284. To Allah belongs everything in the heav￾ens and the earth. Whether you reveal what is 
within your selves, or conceal it, Allah will 
call you to account for it. He forgives whom 
He wills, and He punishes whom He wills. 
Allah is Able to do all things.
285. The Messenger has believed in what was 
revealed to him from his Lord, as did the be￾lievers. They all have believed in Allah, and 
His angels, and His scriptures, and His mes￾sengers: “We make no distinction between 
any of His messengers.” And they say, “We 
hear and we obey. Your forgiveness, our 
Lord. To you is the destiny.”
286. Allah does not burden any soul beyond its 
capacity. To its credit is what it earns, and 
against it is what it commits. “Our Lord, do 
not condemn us if we forget or make a mis￾take. Our Lord, do not burden us as You have 
burdened those before us. Our Lord, do not 
burden us with more than we have strength 
to bear; and pardon us, and forgive us, and 
have mercy on us. You are our Lord and Mas￾ter, so help us against the disbelieving peo￾ple.”
3. FAMILY OF IMRAN
(Ali ‘Imran)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Alif, Lam, Meem.
2. Allah, there is no god but He, the Living, the 
Eternal.
3. He sent down to you the Book with the 
Truth, confirming what came before it; and 
He sent down the Torah and the Gospel.
4. Aforetime, as guidance for mankind; and 
He sent down the Criterion. Those who have 
rejected Allah’s signs will have a severe pun￾ishment. Allah is Mighty, Able to take re￾venge.
5. Nothing is hidden from Allah, on earth or 
in the heaven.
6. It is He who forms you in the wombs as He 
wills. There is no god except He, the Al￾mighty, the Wise.
7. It is He who revealed to you the Book. Some 
of its verses are definitive; they are the foun￾dation of the Book, and others are unspecific. 
As for those in whose hearts is deviation, they 
follow the unspecific part, seeking descent, 
and seeking to derive an interpretation. But 
none knows its interpretation except Allah
and those firmly rooted in knowledge say, 
“We believe in it; all is from our Lord.” But 
none recollects except those with under￾standing.
8. “Our Lord, do not cause our hearts to 
swerve after You have guided us, and bestow 
on us mercy from Your presence; You are the 
Giver.”
9. “Our Lord, You will gather the people for a 
Day in which there is no doubt.” Allah will 
never break His promise.
17
3. FAMILY OF IMRAN (Ali ‘Imran)
10. As for those who disbelieve, neither their 
wealth nor their children will avail them any￾thing against Allah. These will be fuel for the 
Fire.
11. Like the behavior of Pharaoh’s people and 
those before them. They rejected Our signs, 
so Allah seized them for their sins. Allah is 
Strict in retribution.
12. Say to those who disbelieve, “You will be 
defeated, and rounded up into Hell—an aw￾ful resting-place.”
13. There was a sign for you in the two parties 
that met. One party fighting in the way of Al￾lah, and the other was disbelieving. They saw 
them with their own eyes twice their number. 
But Allah supports with His help whomever 
He wills. In that is a lesson for those with in￾sight.
14. Adorned for the people is the love of de￾sires, such as women, and children, and piles 
upon piles of gold and silver, and branded 
horses, and livestock, and fields. These are 
the conveniences of the worldly life, but with 
Allah lies the finest resort.
15. Say, “Shall I inform you of something bet￾ter than that? For those who are righteous, 
with their Lord are Gardens beneath which 
rivers flow, where they will remain forever, 
and purified spouses, and acceptance from 
Allah.” Allah is Observant of the servants.
16. Those who say, “Our Lord, we have be￾lieved, so forgive us our sins, and save us 
from the suffering of the Fire.”
17. The patient, and the truthful, and the rev￾erent, and the charitable, and the seekers of 
forgiveness at dawn.
18. Allah bears witness that there is no god but 
He, as do the angels, and those endowed with 
knowledge—upholding justice. There is no 
god but He, the Mighty, the Wise.
19. Religion with Allah is Islam. Those to 
whom the Scripture was given differed only 
after knowledge came to them, out of envy 
among themselves. Whoever rejects the signs 
of Allah—Allah is quick to take account.
20. If they argue with you, say, “I have surren￾dered myself to Allah, and those who follow 
me.” And say to those who were given the 
Scripture, and to the unlearned, “Have you 
surrendered?” If they have surrendered, then 
they are guided; but if they turn away, then 
your duty is to convey. Allah is Seeing of the 
servants.
21. As for those who defy Allah’s revelations, 
and kill the prophets unjustly, and kill those 
who advocate justice among the people—
promise them a painful retribution.
22. They are those whose deeds will come to 
nothing, in this world and in the Hereafter; 
and they will have no saviors.
23. Have you not considered those who were 
given a share of the Scripture, as they were 
called to the Scripture of Allah to arbitrate be￾tween them; then some of them turned back, 
and declined?
24. That is because they said, “The Fire will not 
touch us except for a limited number of 
days.” They have been misled in their religion 
by the lies they fabricated.
25. How about when We gather them for a 
Day in which there is no doubt, and each soul 
will be paid in full for what it has earned, and 
they will not be wronged?
26. Say, “O Allah, Owner of Sovereignty. You 
grant sovereignty to whom You will, and You 
strip sovereignty from whom you will. You 
honor whom you will, and You humiliate 
whom you will. In Your hand is all goodness. 
You are Capable of all things.”
27. “You merge the night into the day, and 
You merge the day into the night; and you 
bring the living out of the dead, and You 
bring the dead out of the living; and You pro￾vide for whom you will without measure.”
28. Believers are not to take disbelievers for 
friends instead of believers. Whoever does 
that has nothing to do with Allah, unless it is 
to protect your own selves against them. Al￾lah warns you to beware of Him. To Allah is 
the destiny.
18
3. FAMILY OF IMRAN (Ali ‘Imran)
29. Say, “Whether you conceal what is in your 
hearts, or disclose it, Allah knows it.” He 
knows everything in the heavens and the 
earth. Allah is Powerful over everything.
30. On the Day when every soul finds all the 
good it has done presented. And as for the 
evil it has done, it will wish there were a great 
distance between them. Allah cautions you of 
Himself. Allah is Kind towards the servants.
31. Say, “If you love Allah, then follow me, and 
Allah will love you, and will forgive you your 
sins.” Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
32. Say, “Obey Allah and the Messenger.” But 
if they turn away—Allah does not love the 
faithless.
33. Allah chose Adam, and Noah, and the fam￾ily of Abraham, and the family of Imran, over 
all mankind.
34. Offspring one of the other. Allah is Hearer 
and Knower.
35. The wife of Imran said, “My Lord, I have 
vowed to You what is in my womb, dedi￾cated, so accept from me; You are the Hearer 
and Knower.”
36. And when she delivered her, she said, “My 
Lord, I have delivered a female,” and Allah 
was well aware of what she has delivered, 
“and the male is not like the female, and I 
have named her Mary, and have commended 
her and her descendants to Your protection, 
from Satan the outcast.”
37. Her Lord accepted her with a gracious re￾ception, and brought her a beautiful upbring￾ing, and entrusted her to the care of Zecha￾riah. Whenever Zechariah entered upon her 
in the sanctuary, he found her with provision. 
He said, “O Mary, where did you get this 
from?” She said, “It is from Allah; Allah pro￾vides to whom He wills without reckoning.”
38. Thereupon Zechariah prayed to his Lord; 
he said, “My Lord, bestow on me good off￾spring from Your presence; You are the 
Hearer of Prayers.” 
39. Then the angels called out to him, as he 
stood praying in the sanctuary: “Allah gives 
you good news of John; confirming a Word 
from Allah, and honorable, and moral, and a 
prophet; one of the upright.”
40. He said, “My Lord, how will I have a son, 
when old age has overtaken me, and my wife 
is barren?” He said, “Even so, Allah does 
whatever He wills.” 
41. He said, “My Lord, give me a sign.” He said, 
“Your sign is that you shall not speak to the 
people for three days, except by gestures. And 
remember your Lord much, and praise in the 
evening and the morning.”
42. The angels said, “O Mary, Allah has chosen 
you, and has purified you. He has chosen you 
over all the women of the world. 
43. “O Mary, be devoted to your Lord, and 
bow down, and kneel with those who kneel.”
44. These are accounts from the Unseen, 
which We reveal to you. You were not with 
them when they cast their lots as to which of 
them would take charge of Mary; nor were 
you with them as they quarreled.
45. The Angels said, “O Mary, Allah gives you 
good news of a Word from Him. His name is 
the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, well-es￾teemed in this world and the next, and one of 
the nearest.
46. He will speak to the people from the crib, 
and in adulthood, and will be one of the 
righteous.”
47. She said, “My Lord, how can I have a child, 
when no man has touched me?” He said, “It 
will be so. Allah creates whatever He wills. To 
have anything done, He only says to it, ‘Be,’ 
and it is.”
48. And He will teach him the Scripture and 
wisdom, and the Torah and the Gospel.
49. A messenger to the Children of Israel: “I 
have come to you with a sign from your Lord. 
I make for you out of clay the figure of a bird; 
then I breathe into it, and it becomes a bird 
by Allah’s leave. And I heal the blind and the 
leprous, and I revive the dead, by Allah’s 
leave. And I inform you concerning what you 
19
3. FAMILY OF IMRAN (Ali ‘Imran)
eat, and what you store in your homes. In that 
is a sign for you, if you are believers.”
50. “And verifying what lies before me of the 
Torah, and to make lawful for you some of 
what was forbidden to you. I have come to 
you with a sign from your Lord; so fear Allah, 
and obey me.”
51. “Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so wor￾ship Him. That is a straight path.”
52. When Jesus sensed disbelief on their part, 
he said, “Who are my allies towards Allah?” 
The disciples said, “We are Allah’s allies; we 
have believed in Allah, and bear witness that 
we submit.”
53. “Our Lord, we have believed in what You 
have revealed, and we have followed the Mes￾senger, so count us among the witnesses.”
54. They planned, and Allah planned; but Al￾lah is the Best of planners. 
55. Allah said, “O Jesus, I am terminating your
life, and raising you to Me, and clearing you 
of those who disbelieve. And I will make 
those who follow you superior to those who 
disbelieve, until the Day of Resurrection. 
Then to Me is your return; then I will judge 
between you regarding what you were dis￾puting.
56. As for those who disbelieve, I will punish 
them with a severe punishment, in this world 
and the next, and they will have no helpers.
57. And as for those who believe and do good 
works, He will give them their rewards in full. 
Allah does not love the unjust.”
58. This is what We recite to you of the Verses 
and the Wise Reminder.
59. The likeness of Jesus in Allah’s sight is that 
of Adam: He created him from dust, then 
said to him, “Be,” and he was.
60. The truth is from your Lord, so do not be 
of those who doubt.
61. And if anyone disputes with you about 
him, after the knowledge that has come to 
you, say, “Come, let us call our children and 
your children, and our women and your 
women, and ourselves and yourselves, and let 
us invoke Allah’s curse on the liars.”
62. This is the narrative of truth: there is no 
god but Allah. Allah is the Mighty, the Wise.
63. But if they turn away—Allah knows the 
corrupt.
64. Say, “O People of the Book, come to terms 
common between us and you: that we wor￾ship none but Allah, and that we associate 
nothing with Him, and that none of us takes 
others as lords besides Allah.” And if they 
turn away, say, “Bear witness that we have 
submitted.” 
65. O People of the Book! Why do you argue 
about Abraham, when the Torah and the
Gospel were not revealed until after him? 
Will you not reason?
66. Here you are—you argue about things you 
know, but why do you argue about things you 
do not know? Allah knows, and you do not 
know. 
67. Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Chris￾tian, but he was a Monotheist, a Muslim. And 
he was not of the Polytheists.
68. The people most deserving of Abraham are 
those who followed him, and this prophet, 
and those who believe. Allah is the Guardian 
of the believers.
69. A party of the People of the Book would 
love to lead you astray, but they only lead 
themselves astray, and they do not realize it.
70. O People of the Book! Why do you reject 
the revelations of Allah, even as you witness?
71. O People of the Book! Why do you con￾found the truth with falsehood, and know￾ingly conceal the truth?
72. Some of the People of the Book say, “Be￾lieve in what was revealed to the believers at 
the beginning of the day, and reject it at its 
end, so that they may return.”
73. And trust none except those who follow 
your religion.” Say, “Guidance is Allah’s 
guidance. If someone is given the like of what 
you were given, or they argue with you before 
your Lord, say, “All grace is in Allah’s hand; 
20
3. FAMILY OF IMRAN (Ali ‘Imran)
He gives it to whomever He wills.” Allah is 
Bounteous and Knowing.
74. He specifies His mercy for whomever He 
wills. Allah is Possessor of Sublime Grace.
75. Among the People of the Book is he, who, 
if you entrust him with a heap of gold, he will 
give it back to you. And among them is he, 
who, if you entrust him with a single coin, he 
will not give it back to you, unless you keep 
after him. That is because they say, “We are 
under no obligation towards the gentiles.” 
They tell lies about Allah, and they know it.
76. Indeed, whoever fulfills his commitments 
and maintains piety—Allah loves the pious.
77. Those who exchange the covenant of Allah, 
and their vows, for a small price, will have no 
share in the Hereafter, and Allah will not 
speak to them, nor will He look at them on 
the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify 
them. They will have a painful punishment.
78. And among them are those who twist the 
Scripture with their tongues, that you may 
think it from the Scripture, when it is not 
from the Scripture. And they say, “It is from 
Allah,” when it is not from Allah. They tell 
lies and attribute them to Allah, knowingly.
79. No person to whom Allah has given the 
Scripture, and wisdom, and prophethood 
would ever say to the people, “Be my wor￾shipers rather than Allah’s.” Rather, “Be peo￾ple of the Lord, according to the Scripture 
you teach, and the teachings you learn.”
80. Nor would he command you to take the 
angels and the prophets as lords. Would he 
command you to infidelity after you have 
submitted?
81. Allah received the covenant of the proph￾ets, “Inasmuch as I have given you of scrip￾ture and wisdom; should a messenger come 
to you verifying what you have, you shall be￾lieve in him, and support him.” He said, “Do 
you affirm My covenant and take it upon 
yourselves?” They said, “We affirm it.” He 
said, “Then bear witness, and I am with you 
among the witnesses.”
82. Whoever turns away after that—these are 
the deceitful.
83. Do they desire other than the religion of 
Allah, when to Him has submitted everything 
in the heavens and the earth, willingly or un￾willingly, and to Him they will be returned?
84. Say, “We believe in Allah, and in what was 
revealed to us; and in what was revealed to 
Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, 
and the Patriarchs; and in what was given to 
Moses, and Jesus, and the prophets from 
their Lord. We make no distinction between 
any of them, and to Him we submit.”
85. Whoever seeks other than Islam as a reli￾gion, it will not be accepted from him, and in 
the Hereafter he will be among the losers.
86. How will Allah guide a people who disbe￾lieved after having believed, and had wit￾nessed that the Messenger is true, and the 
clear proofs had come to them? Allah does 
not guide the unjust people.
87. Those—their penalty is that upon them 
falls the curse of Allah, and of the angels, and 
of all mankind.
88. Remaining in it eternally, without their 
punishment being eased from them, and 
without being reprieved.
89. Except those who repent afterwards, and 
reform; for Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
90. As for those who disbelieve after having 
believed, then plunge deeper into disbelief, 
their repentance will not be accepted; these 
are the lost.
91. As for those who disbelieve and die disbe￾lievers, even the earth full of gold would not 
be accepted from any of them, were he to of￾fer it for ransom. These will have a painful 
torment, and will have no saviors.
92. You will not attain virtuous conduct until 
you give of what you cherish. Whatever you 
give away, Allah is aware of it. 
93. All food was permissible to the Children of 
Israel, except what Israel forbade for itself be￾fore the Torah was revealed. Say, “Bring the 
Torah, and read it, if you are truthful.”
21
3. FAMILY OF IMRAN (Ali ‘Imran)
94. Whoever forges lies about Allah after 
that—these are the unjust. 
95. Say, “Allah has spoken the truth, so follow 
the religion of Abraham the Monotheist; he 
was not a Pagan.”
96. The first house established for mankind is 
the one at Bekka; blessed, and guidance for all 
people.
97. In it are evident signs; the Station of Abra￾ham. Whoever enters it attains security. Pil￾grimage to the House is a duty to Allah for all 
who can make the journey. But as for those 
who refuse—Allah is Independent of the 
worlds.
98. Say, “O People of the Scripture, why do you 
reject the Revelations of Allah, when Allah 
witnesses what you do?”
99. Say, “O People of the Scripture, why do you 
hinder from Allah’s path those who believe, 
seeking to distort it, even though you are wit￾nesses? Allah is not unaware of what you do.”
100. O you who believe! If you obey a party of 
those who were given the Scripture, they will 
turn you, after your belief, into disbelievers.
101. And how could you disbelieve, when Al￾lah’s revelations are being recited to you, and 
among you is His Messenger? Whoever 
cleaves to Allah has been guided to a straight 
path.
102. O you who believe! Revere Allah with due 
reverence, and do not die except as Muslims.
103. And hold fast to the rope of Allah, alto￾gether, and do not become divided. And re￾member Allah’s blessings upon you; how you 
were enemies, and He reconciled your hearts, 
and by His grace you became brethren. And 
you were on the brink of a pit of fire, and He 
saved you from it. Allah thus clarifies His rev￾elations for you, so that you may be guided.
104. And let there be among you a community 
calling to virtue, and advocating righteous￾ness, and deterring from evil. These are the 
successful.
105. And do not be like those who separated 
and disputed after the clear proofs came to 
them; for them is a great punishment.
106. On the Day when some faces will be whit￾ened, and some faces will be blackened. As 
for those whose faces are blackened: “Did you
disbelieve after your belief?” Then taste the 
punishment for having disbelieved.
107. But as for those whose faces are whitened: 
they are in Allah’s mercy, remaining in it for￾ever.
108. These are the revelations of Allah. We re￾cite them to you in truth. Allah desires no in￾justice for mankind.
109. To Allah belongs everything in the heav￾ens and everything on earth, and to Allah all 
events are referred.
110. You are the best community that ever 
emerged for humanity: you advocate what is 
moral, and forbid what is immoral, and be￾lieve in Allah. Had the People of the Scripture 
believed, it would have been better for them. 
Among them are the believers, but most of 
them are sinners.
111. They will do you no harm, beyond insult￾ing you. And if they fight you, they will turn 
around and flee, then they will not be helped.
112. They shall be humiliated wherever they 
are encountered, except through a rope from 
Allah, and a rope from the people; and they 
incurred wrath from Allah, and were stricken 
with misery. That is because they rejected Al￾lah’s revelations, and killed the prophets un￾justly. That is because they rebelled and com￾mitted aggression.
113. They are not alike. Among the People of 
the Scripture is a community that is upright; 
they recite Allah’s revelations throughout the 
night, and they prostrate themselves.
114. They believe in Allah and the Last Day, 
and advocate righteousness and forbid evil, 
and are quick to do good deeds. These are 
among the righteous.
115. Whatever good they do, they will not be 
denied it. Allah knows the righteous.
22
3. FAMILY OF IMRAN (Ali ‘Imran)
116. As for those who disbelieve, neither their 
possessions nor their children will avail them 
anything against Allah. These are the inhab￾itants of the Fire, abiding therein forever.
117. The parable of what they spend in this
worldly life is that of a frosty wind that strikes 
the harvest of a people who have wronged 
their souls, and destroys it. Allah did not 
wrong them, but they wronged their own 
selves.
118. O you who believe! Do not befriend out￾siders who never cease to wish you harm. 
They love to see you suffer. Hatred has al￾ready appeared from their mouths, but what 
their hearts conceal is worse. We have made 
the messages clear for you, if you understand.
119. There you are, you love them, but they do 
not love you, and you believe in the entire 
scripture. And when they meet you, they say, 
“We believe;” but when they are alone, they 
bite their fingers in rage at you. Say, “Die in 
your rage; Allah knows what is within the 
hearts.”
120. If something good happens to you, it up￾sets them; but if something bad befalls you, 
they rejoice at it. But if you persevere and 
maintain righteousness, their schemes will 
not harm you at all. Allah comprehends what 
they do.
121. Remember when you left your home in the 
morning, to assign battle-positions for the 
believers. Allah is Hearing and Knowing.
122. When two groups among you almost fal￾tered, but Allah was their Protector. So in Al￾lah let the believers put their trust.
123. Allah had given you victory at Badr, when 
you were weak. So fear Allah, that you may be 
thankful.
124. When you said to the believers, “Is it not 
enough for you that your Lord has reinforced 
you with three thousand angels, sent down?”
125. It is; but if you persevere and remain cau￾tious, and they attack you suddenly, your 
Lord will reinforce you with five thousand 
angels, well trained.
126. Allah made it but a message of hope for 
you, and to reassure your hearts thereby. Vic￾tory comes only from Allah the Almighty, the 
Wise.
127. He thus cuts off a section of those who dis￾believed, or subdues them, so they retreat dis￾appointed. 
128. It is no concern of yours whether He re￾deems them or punishes them. They are 
wrongdoers.
129. To Allah belongs everything in the heav￾ens and the earth. He forgives whom He wills, 
and He punishes whom He wills. Allah is 
Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.
130. O you who believe! Do not feed on usury, 
compounded over and over, and fear Allah, 
so that you may prosper.
131. And guard yourselves against the Fire that 
is prepared for the disbelievers.
132. And obey Allah and the Messenger, that 
you may obtain mercy.
133. And race towards forgiveness from your 
Lord, and a Garden as wide as the heavens 
and the earth, prepared for the righteous. 
134. Those who give in prosperity and adver￾sity, and those who restrain anger, and those 
who forgive people. Allah loves the doers of 
good.
135. And those who, when they commit an in￾decency or wrong themselves, remember Al￾lah and ask forgiveness for their sins—and 
who forgives sins except Allah? And they do 
not persist in their wrongdoing while they 
know.
136. Those—their reward is forgiveness from 
their Lord, and gardens beneath which rivers 
flow, abiding therein forever. How excellent 
is the reward of the workers. 
137. Many societies have passed away before 
you. So travel the earth and note the fate of 
the deniers.
138. This is a proclamation to humanity, and 
guidance, and advice for the righteous.
23
3. FAMILY OF IMRAN (Ali ‘Imran)
139. And do not waver, nor feel remorse. You 
are the superior ones, if you are believers. 
140. If a wound afflicts you, a similar wound 
has afflicted the others. Such days We alter￾nate between the people, that Allah may 
know those who believe, and take martyrs 
from among you. Allah does not love the evil￾doers.
141. So that Allah may prove those who believe, 
and eliminate the disbelievers. 
142. Or do you expect to enter Paradise, before 
Allah has distinguished those among you 
who strive, and before He has distinguished 
the steadfast? 
143. You used to wish for death before you 
have faced it. Now you have seen it before 
your own eyes.
144. Muhammad is no more than a messenger. 
Messengers have passed on before him. If he 
dies or gets killed, will you turn on your 
heels? He who turns on his heels will not 
harm Allah in any way. And Allah will re￾ward the appreciative.
145. No soul can die except by Allah’s leave, at 
a predetermined time. Whoever desires the 
reward of the world, We will give him some 
of it; and whoever desires the reward of the 
Hereafter, We will give him some of it; and 
We will reward the appreciative.
146. How many a prophet fought alongside 
him numerous godly people? They did not 
waver for what afflicted them in the cause of 
Allah, nor did they weaken, nor did they give 
in. Allah loves those who endure.
147. Their only words were, “Our Lord, forgive 
us our offences, and our excesses in our con￾duct, and strengthen our foothold, and help 
us against the disbelieving people.”
148. So Allah gave them the reward of this 
world, and the excellent reward of the Here￾after. Allah loves the doers of good.
149. O you who believe! If you obey those who 
disbelieve, they will turn you back on your 
heels, and you end up losers.
150. Allah is your Master, and He is the Best of 
Helpers.
151. We will throw terror into the hearts of 
those who disbelieve, because they attribute 
to Allah partners for which He revealed no 
sanction. Their lodging is the Fire. Miserable 
is the lodging of the evildoers.
152. Allah has fulfilled His promise to you, and 
you defeated them by His leave; until when 
you faltered, and disputed the command, and 
disobeyed after He had shown you what you 
like. Some of you want this world, and some 
of you want the next. Then He turned you 
away from them, to test you; but He par￾doned you. Allah is Gracious towards the be￾lievers.
153. Remember when you fled, not caring for 
anyone, even though the Messenger was call￾ing you from your rear. Then He repaid you 
with sorrow upon sorrow, so that you would 
not grieve over what you missed, or for what 
afflicted you. Allah is Informed of what you 
do.
154. Then after the setback, He sent down se￾curity upon you. Slumber overcame some of 
you, while others cared only for themselves, 
thinking of Allah thoughts that were un￾true—thoughts of ignorance—saying, “Is an￾ything up to us?” Say, “Everything is up to Al￾lah.” They conceal within themselves what 
they do not reveal to you. And they say, “If it 
was up to us, none of us would have been 
killed here.” Say, “Even if you Had stayed in 
your homes, those destined to be killed would 
have marched into their death beds.” Allah 
thus tests what is in your minds, and purifies 
what is in your hearts. Allah knows what the 
hearts contain.
155. Those of you who turned back on the day 
when the two armies clashed—it was Satan 
who caused them to backslide, on account of 
some of what they have earned. But Allah has 
forgiven them. Allah is Forgiving and Pru￾dent.
156. O you who believe! Do not be like those 
who disbelieved, and said of their brethren 
24
3. FAMILY OF IMRAN (Ali ‘Imran)
who marched in the land, or went on the of￾fensive, “Had they stayed with us, they would 
not have died or been killed.” So that Allah 
may make it a cause of regret in their hearts. 
Allah gives life and causes death. Allah is See￾ing of what you do.
157. If you are killed in the cause of Allah, or 
die—forgiveness and mercy from Allah are 
better than what they hoard.
158. If you die, or are killed—to Allah you will 
be gathered up.
159. It is by of grace from Allah that you were 
gentle with them. Had you been harsh, hard￾hearted, they would have dispersed from 
around you. So pardon them, and ask for￾giveness for them, and consult them in the 
conduct of affairs. And when you make a de￾cision, put your trust in Allah; Allah loves the 
trusting.
160. If Allah supports you, there is none who 
can overcome you. But if He fails you, who is 
there to help you after Him? So in Allah let
the believers put their trust.
161. It is not for a prophet to act dishonestly. 
Whoever acts dishonestly will bring his dis￾honesty on the Day of Resurrection. Then 
every soul will be paid in full for what it has 
earned, and they will not be wronged.
162. Is someone who pursues Allah's approval 
the same as someone who incurs Allah's 
wrath and his refuge is Hell—the miserable 
destination?
163. They have different ranks with Allah, and 
Allah is Seeing of what they do.
164. Allah has blessed the believers, as He 
raised up among them a messenger from 
among themselves, who recites to them His 
revelations, and purifies them, and teaches 
them the Scripture and wisdom; although be￾fore that they were in evident error.
165. And when a calamity befell you, even after 
you had inflicted twice as much, you said, 
“How is this?” Say, “It is from your own 
selves.” Allah is Able to do all things.
166. What befell you on the day the two armies 
clashed was with Allah’s permission; that He 
may know the believers.
167. And that He may know the hypocrites. 
And it was said to them, “Come, fight in the 
cause of Allah, or contribute.” They said, “If 
we knew how to fight, we would have fol￾lowed you.” On that day they were closer to 
infidelity than they were to faith. They say 
with their mouths what is not in their hearts; 
but Allah knows what they hide.
168. Those who said of their brethren, as they 
stayed behind, “Had they obeyed us, they 
would not have been killed.” Say, “Then avert 
death from yourselves, if you are truthful.”
169. Do not consider those killed in the cause 
of Allah as dead. In fact, they are alive, at their 
Lord, well provided for.
170. Delighting in what Allah has given them 
out of His grace, and happy for those who 
have not yet joined them; that they have 
nothing to fear, nor will they grieve.
171. They rejoice in grace from Allah, and 
bounty, and that Allah will not waste the re￾ward of the faithful.
172. Those who responded to Allah and the 
Messenger, despite the persecution they had 
suffered. For the virtuous and the pious 
among them is a great reward.
173. Those to whom the people have said, “The 
people have mobilized against you, so fear 
them.” But this only increased them in faith, 
and they said, “Allah is enough for us; He is 
the Excellent Protector.”
174. So they came back with grace from Allah, 
and bounty, and no harm having touched 
them. They pursued what pleases Allah. Al￾lah possesses immense grace.
175. That is only Satan frightening his parti￾sans; so do not fear them, but fear Me, if you 
are believers.
176. And do not be saddened by those who 
rush into disbelief. They will not harm Allah 
in the least. Allah desires to give them no 
25
3. FAMILY OF IMRAN (Ali ‘Imran)
share in the Hereafter. A terrible torment 
awaits them.
177. Those who exchange blasphemy for faith 
will not harm Allah in the least. A painful tor￾ment awaits them.
178. Those who disbelieve should not assume 
that We respite them for their own good. In 
fact, We only respite them so that they may 
increase in sinfulness. A humiliating torment 
awaits them.
179. Allah will not leave the believers as you 
are, without distinguishing the wicked from 
the sincere. Nor will Allah inform you of the 
future, but Allah elects from among His mes￾sengers whom He wills. So believe in Allah 
and His messengers. If you believe and prac￾tice piety, you will have a splendid reward.
180. Those who withhold what Allah has given 
them of his bounty should not assume that is 
good for them. In fact, it is bad for them. 
They will be encircled by their hoardings on 
the Day of Resurrection. To Allah belongs the 
inheritance of the heavens and the earth, and 
Allah is well acquainted with what you do.
181. Allah has heard the statement of those 
who said, “Allah is poor, and we are rich.” We 
will write down what they said, and their 
wrongful killing of the prophets; and We will 
say, “Taste the torment of the burning.”
182. “This is on account of what your hands 
have forwarded, and because Allah is not un￾just towards the creatures.”
183. Those who said, “Allah has made a cove￾nant with us, that we shall not believe in any 
messenger unless he brings us an offering to 
be consumed by fire.” Say, “Messengers have 
come to you before me with proofs, and with 
what you asked for; so why did you assassi￾nate them, if you are truthful?”
184. If they accuse you of lying, messengers be￾fore you were accused of lying. They came 
with the proofs, and the Psalms, and the Illu￾minating Scripture.
185. Every soul will have a taste of death, and 
you will receive your recompense on the Day 
of Resurrection. Whoever is swayed from the 
Fire, and admitted to Paradise, has won. The 
life of this world is merely enjoyment of de￾lusion.
186. You will be tested through your posses￾sions and your persons; and you will hear 
from those who received the Scripture before 
you, and from the idol worshipers, much 
abuse. But if you persevere and lead a right￾eous life—that indeed is a mark of great de￾termination. 
187. Allah received a pledge from those who 
were given the Scripture: “You shall proclaim 
it to the people, and not conceal it.” But they 
disregarded it behind their backs, and ex￾changed it for a small price. What a miserable 
exchange they made.
188. Do not think that those who rejoice in 
what they have done, and love to be praised 
for what they have not done—do not think 
they can evade the punishment. They will 
have a painful punishment.
189. To Allah belongs the sovereignty of the 
heavens and the earth. Allah has power over 
all things.
190. In the creation of the heavens and the 
earth, and in the alternation of night and day, 
are signs for people of understanding.
191. Those who remember Allah while stand￾ing, and sitting, and on their sides; and they 
reflect upon the creation of the heavens and 
the earth: “Our Lord, You did not create this 
in vain, glory to You, so protect us from the 
punishment of the Fire.”
192. “Our Lord, whomever You commit to the 
Fire, You have disgraced. The wrongdoers 
will have no helpers.”
193. “Our Lord, we have heard a caller calling 
to the faith: `Believe in your Lord,' and we 
have believed. Our Lord! Forgive us our sins, 
and remit our misdeeds, and make us die in 
the company of the virtuous.”
194. “Our Lord, and give us what You have 
promised us through Your messengers, and 
do not disgrace us on the Day of Resurrec￾tion. Surely You never break a promise.”

4. WOMEN (an-Nisa’)
195. And so their Lord answered them: “I will 
not waste the work of any worker among you, 
whether male or female. You are one of an￾other. For those who emigrated, and were ex￾pelled from their homes, and were persecuted 
because of Me, and fought and were killed—
I will remit for them their sins, and will admit 
them into gardens beneath which rivers 
flow—a reward from Allah. With Allah is the 
ultimate reward.”
196. Do not be impressed by the disbelievers’ 
movements in the land.
197. A brief enjoyment, then their abode is 
Hell. What a miserable resort.
198. As for those who feared their Lord: for 
them will be gardens beneath which rivers 
flow, wherein they will abide forever—hospi￾tality from Allah. What Allah possesses is 
best for the just.
199. Among the People of the Scripture are 
those who believe in Allah, and in what was 
revealed to you, and in what was revealed to 
them. They are humble before Allah, and 
they do not sell Allah’s revelations for a cheap 
price. These will have their reward with their 
Lord. Allah is swift in reckoning.
200. O you who believe! Be patient, and advo￾cate patience, and be united, and revere Al￾lah, so that you may thrive.
4. WOMEN
(an-Nisa’)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. O people! Fear your Lord, who created you 
from a single soul, and created from it its 
mate, and propagated from them many men 
and women. And revere Allah whom you ask 
about, and the parents. Surely, Allah is 
Watchful over you.
2. And give orphans their properties, and do 
not substitute the bad for the good. And do 
not consume their properties by combining 
them with yours, for that would be a serious 
sin.
3. If you fear you cannot act fairly towards the 
orphans—then marry the women you like—
two, or three, or four. But if you fear you will 
not be fair, then one, or what you already 
have. That makes it more likely that you 
avoid bias.
4. Give women their dowries graciously. But if 
they willingly forego some of it, then con￾sume it with enjoyment and pleasure.
5. Do not give the immature your money 
which Allah has assigned to you for support. 
But provide for them from it, and clothe 
them, and speak to them with kind words.
6. Test the orphans until they reach the age of 
marriage. If you find them to be mature 
enough, hand over their properties to them. 
And do not consume it extravagantly or hast￾ily before they grow up. The rich shall not 
charge any wage, but the poor may charge 
fairly. When you hand over their properties 
to them, have it witnessed for them. Allah 
suffices as a Reckoner.
7. Men receive a share of what their parents 
and relatives leave, and women receive a 
share of what their parents and relatives 
leave; be it little or much—a legal share.
8. If the distribution is attended by the rela￾tives, and the orphans, and the needy, give 
them something out of it, and speak to them 
kindly.
9. Those who are concerned about the fate of 
their weak children, in case they leave them 
behind, should fear Allah, and speak appro￾priate words.
10. Those who consume the wealth of orphans 
illicitly consume only fire into their bellies; 
and they will roast in a Blaze.
11. Allah instructs you regarding your chil￾dren: The male receives the equivalent of the 
share of two females. If they are daughters, 
more than two, they get two-thirds of what he 
leaves. If there is only one, she gets one-half. 
As for the parents, each gets one-sixth of 
what he leaves, if he had children. If he had 
no children, and his parents inherit from 
27
4. WOMEN (an-Nisa’)
him, his mother gets one-third. If he has sib￾lings, his mother gets one-sixth. After ful￾filling any bequest and paying off debts. Your 
parents and your children—you do not know 
which are closer to you in welfare. This is Al￾lah's Law. Allah is Knowing and Judicious.
12. You get one-half of what your wives leave 
behind, if they had no children. If they had 
children, you get one-fourth of what they 
leave. After fulfilling any bequest and paying 
off debts. They get one-fourth of what you 
leave behind, if you have no children. If you 
have children, they get one-eighth of what 
you leave. After fulfilling any bequest and 
paying off debts. If a man or woman leaves 
neither parents nor children, but has a 
brother or sister, each of them gets one-sixth. 
If there are more siblings, they share one￾third. After fulfilling any bequest and paying 
off debts, without any prejudice. This is a will 
from Allah. Allah is Knowing and Clement.
13. These are the bounds set by Allah. Who￾ever obeys Allah and His Messenger, He will 
admit him into Gardens beneath which rivers 
flow, to abide therein forever. That is the 
great attainment.
14. But whoever disobeys Allah and His Mes￾senger, and oversteps His bounds, He will ad￾mit him into a Fire, wherein he abides for￾ever, and he will have a shameful punish￾ment.
15. Those of your women who commit lewd￾ness, you must have four witnesses against 
them, from among you. If they testify, con￾fine them to the homes until death claims 
them, or Allah makes a way for them.
16. If two men among you commit it, punish 
them both. But if they repent and reform, 
leave them alone. Allah is Redeemer, Full of 
Mercy.
17. Repentance is available from Allah for 
those who commit evil out of ignorance, and 
then repent soon after. These—Allah will re￾lent towards them. Allah is Knowing and 
Wise.
18. But repentance is not available for those 
who commit evils, until when death ap￾proaches one of them, he says, “Now I re￾pent,” nor for those who die as disbelievers. 
These—We have prepared for them a painful 
torment.
19. O you who believe! It is not permitted for 
you to inherit women against their will. And 
do not coerce them in order to take away 
some of what you had given them, unless they 
commit a proven adultery. And live with 
them in kindness. If you dislike them, it may 
be that you dislike something in which Allah 
has placed much good.
20. If you wish to replace one wife with an￾other, and you have given one of them a for￾tune, take nothing back from it. Would you 
take it back fraudulently and sinfully?
21. And how can you take it back, when you 
have been intimate with one another, and 
they have received from you a solid commit￾ment?
22. Do not marry women whom your fathers 
married, except what is already past. That is 
improper, indecent, and a bad custom.
23. Forbidden for you are your mothers, your 
daughters, your sisters, your paternal aunts, 
your maternal aunts, your brother's daugh￾ters, your sister's daughters, your foster￾mothers who nursed you, your sisters 
through nursing, your wives' mothers, and 
your stepdaughters in your guardianship—
born of wives you have gone into—but if you 
have not gone into them, there is no blame on 
you. And the wives of your genetic sons, and 
marrying two sisters simultaneously. Except 
what is past. Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most 
Merciful.
24. And all married women, except those you 
rightfully possess. This is Allah’s decree, 
binding upon you. Permitted for you are 
those that lie outside these limits, provided 
you seek them in legal marriage, with gifts 
from your property, seeking wedlock, not 
prostitution. If you wish to enjoy them, then 
give them their dowry—a legal obligation. 
You commit no error by agreeing to any 
28
4. WOMEN (an-Nisa’)
change to the dowry. Allah is All-Knowing, 
Most Wise.
25. If any of you lack the means to marry free 
believing women, he may marry one of the 
believing maids under your control. Allah is 
well aware of your faith. You are from one 
another. Marry them with the permission of 
their guardians, and give them their recom￾pense fairly—to be protected—neither com￾mitting adultery, nor taking secret lovers. 
When they are married, if they commit adul￾tery, their punishment shall be half that of 
free women. That is for those among you who 
fear falling into decadence. But to practice 
self-restraint is better for you. Allah is Most 
Forgiving, Most Merciful.
26. Allah intends to make things clear to you, 
and to guide you in the ways of those before 
you, and to redeem you. Allah is Most Know￾ing, Most Wise.
27. Allah intends to redeem you, but those 
who follow their desires want you to turn 
away utterly.
28. Allah intends to lighten your burden, for 
the human being was created weak.
29. O you who believe! Do not consume each 
other’s wealth illicitly, but trade by mutual 
consent. And do not kill yourselves, for Allah 
is Merciful towards you.
30. Whoever does that, out of hostility and 
wrongdoing, We will cast him into a Fire. 
And that would be easy for Allah.
31. If you avoid the worst of what you are for￾bidden, We will remit your sins, and admit 
you by a Gate of Honor.
32. Do not covet what Allah has given to some 
of you in preference to others. For men is a 
share of what they have earned, and for 
women is a share of what they have earned. 
And ask Allah of his bounty. Allah has 
knowledge of everything.
33. To everyone We have assigned beneficiar￾ies in what is left by parents and relatives. 
Those with whom you have made an agree￾ment, give them their share. Allah is Witness 
over all things.
34. Men are the protectors and maintainers of 
women, as Allah has given some of them an 
advantage over others, and because they 
spend out of their wealth. The good women 
are obedient, guarding what Allah would 
have them guard. As for those from whom 
you fear disloyalty, admonish them, and 
abandon them in their beds, then strike them. 
But if they obey you, seek no way against 
them. Allah is Sublime, Great.
35. If you fear a breach between the two, ap￾point an arbiter from his family and an arbi￾ter from her family. If they wish to reconcile, 
Allah will bring them together. Allah is 
Knowledgeable, Expert.
36. Worship Allah, and ascribe no partners to 
Him, and be good to the parents, and the rel￾atives, and the orphans, and the poor, and the 
neighbor next door, and the distant neighbor, 
and the close associate, and the traveler, and 
your servants. Allah does not love the arro￾gant showoff.
37. Those who are stingy, and exhort people to 
stinginess, and conceal what Allah has given 
them from His bounty. We have prepared for 
the disbelievers a disgraceful punishment.
38. And those who spend their money to be 
seen by people, and believe neither in Allah 
nor in the Last Day. Whoever has Satan as a 
companion—what an evil companion.
39. What would they have lost, had they be￾lieved in Allah and the Last Day, and gave out 
of what Allah has provided for them? Allah 
knows them very well.
40. Allah does not commit an atom's weight of 
injustice; and if there is a good deed, He dou￾bles it, and gives from His Presence a sublime 
compensation.
41. Then how will it be, when We bring a wit￾ness from every community, and We bring 
you as a witness against these?
42. On that Day, those who disbelieved and 
disobeyed the Messenger will wish that the 
earth were leveled over them. They will con￾ceal nothing from Allah.
29
4. WOMEN (an-Nisa’)
43. O you who believe! Do not approach the 
prayer while you are drunk, so that you know 
what you say; nor after sexual orgasm—un￾less you are travelling—until you have 
bathed. If you are sick, or traveling, or one of 
you comes from the toilet, or you have had 
intercourse with women, and cannot find 
water, find clean sand and wipe your faces 
and your hands with it. Allah is Pardoning 
and Forgiving.
44. Have you not considered those who were 
given a share of the Book? They buy error, 
and wish you would lose the way.
45. But Allah knows your enemies best. Allah 
is sufficient as a Protector, and Allah is suffi￾cient as a Supporter.
46. Among the Jews are some who take words 
out of context, and say, “We hear and we dis￾obey”, and “Hear without listening”, and 
“Observe us,” twisting with their tongues and 
slandering the religion. Had they said, “We 
hear and we obey”, and “Listen”, and “Give 
us your attention,” it would have been better 
for them, and more upright. But Allah has 
cursed them for their disbelief; they do not 
believe except a little.
47. O you who were given the Book! Believe in 
what We sent down, confirming what you 
have, before We obliterate faces and turn 
them inside out, or curse them as We cursed 
the Sabbath-breakers. The command of Allah 
is always done.
48. Allah does not forgive association with 
Him, but He forgives anything less than that 
to whomever He wills. Whoever associates 
anything with Allah has devised a monstrous 
sin.
49. Have you not considered those who claim 
purity for themselves? Rather, Allah purifies 
whom He wills, and they will not be wronged 
a whit.
50. See how they devise lies against Allah. That 
alone is an outright sin.
51. Have you not considered those who were 
given a share of the Book? They believe in su￾perstition and evil powers, and say of those 
who disbelieve, “These are better guided on 
the way than the believers.”
52. Those are they whom Allah has cursed. 
Whomever Allah curses, you will find no sav￾ior for him.
53. Or do they own a share of the kingdom? 
Then they would not give people a speck.
54. Or do they envy the people for what Allah 
has given them of His grace? We have given 
the family of Abraham the Book and wisdom, 
and We have given them a great kingdom.
55. Among them are those who believed in it, 
and among them are those who held back 
from it. Hell is a sufficient Inferno.
56. Those who reject Our revelations—We will 
scorch them in a Fire. Every time their skins 
are cooked, We will replace them with other 
skins, so they will experience the suffering. 
Allah is Most Powerful, Most Wise.
57. As for those who believe and do good 
deeds, We will admit them into Gardens be￾neath which rivers flow, abiding therein for￾ever. They will have purified spouses therein, 
and We will admit them into a shady shade.
58. Allah instructs you to give back things en￾trusted to you to their owners. And when you 
judge between people, judge with justice. Al￾lah’s instructions to you are excellent. Allah 
is All-Hearing, All-Seeing.
59. O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey 
the Messenger and those in authority among 
you. And if you dispute over anything, refer 
it to Allah and the Messenger, if you believe 
in Allah and the Last Day. That is best, and a 
most excellent determination.
60. Have you not observed those who claim 
that they believe in what was revealed to you, 
and in what was revealed before you, yet they 
seek Satanic sources for legislation, in spite of 
being commanded to reject them? Satan 
means to mislead them far away.
61. And when it is said to them, “Come to what 
Allah has revealed, and to the Messenger,” 
you see the hypocrites shunning you com￾pletely.
30
4. WOMEN (an-Nisa’)
62. How about when a disaster strikes them 
because what their hands have put forward, 
and then they come to you swearing by Allah: 
“We only intended goodwill and reconcilia￾tion”?
63. They are those whom Allah knows what is 
in their hearts. So ignore them, and admon￾ish them, and say to them concerning them￾selves penetrating words.
64. We did not send any messenger except to 
be obeyed by Allah’s leave. Had they, when 
they wronged themselves, come to you, and 
prayed for Allah's forgiveness, and the Mes￾senger had prayed for their forgiveness, they 
would have found Allah Relenting and Mer￾ciful.
65. But no, by your Lord, they will not believe 
until they call you to arbitrate in their dis￾putes, and then find within themselves no re￾sentment regarding your decisions, and sub￾mit themselves completely.
66. Had We decreed for them: “Kill your￾selves,” or “Leave your homes,” they would 
not have done it, except for a few of them. But 
had they done what they were instructed to 
do, it would have been better for them, and a 
firmer confirmation.
67. And We would have given them from Our 
presence a rich compensation.
68. And We would have guided them on a 
straight path.
69. Whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger—
these are with those whom Allah has 
blessed—among the prophets, and the sin￾cere, and the martyrs, and the upright. Excel￾lent are those as companions.
70. That is the grace from Allah. Allah suffices 
as Knower.
71. O you who believe! Take your precautions, 
and mobilize in groups, or mobilize alto￾gether.
72. Among you is he who lags behind. Then, 
when a calamity befalls you, he says, “Allah 
has favored me, that I was not martyred with 
them.”
73. But when some bounty from Allah comes 
to you, he says—as if no affection existed be￾tween you and him—“If only I had been with 
them, I would have achieved a great victory.”
74. Let those who sell the life of this world for 
the Hereafter fight in the cause of Allah. 
Whoever fights in the cause of Allah, and 
then is killed, or achieves victory, We will 
grant him a great compensation.
75. And why would you not fight in the cause 
of Allah, and the helpless men, and women, 
and children, cry out, “Our Lord, deliver us 
from this town whose people are oppressive, 
and appoint for us from Your Presence a Pro￾tector, and appoint for us from Your Pres￾ence a Victor.”
76. Those who believe fight in the cause of Al￾lah, while those who disbelieve fight in the 
cause of Evil. So fight the allies of the Devil. 
Surely the strategy of the Devil is weak.
77. Have you not considered those who were 
told, “Restrain your hands, and perform your 
prayers, and spend in regular charity”? But 
when fighting was ordained for them, a fac￾tion of them feared the people as Allah is 
ought to be feared, or even more. And they 
said, “Our Lord, why did You ordain fighting 
for us? If only You would postpone it for us 
for a short while.” Say, “The enjoyments of 
this life are brief, but the Hereafter is better 
for the righteous, and you will not be 
wronged one bit.”
78. Wherever you may be, death will catch up 
with you, even if you were in fortified towers. 
When a good fortune comes their way, they 
say, “This is from Allah.” But when a misfor￾tune befalls them, they say, “This is from 
you.” Say, “All is from Allah.” So what is the 
matter with these people, that they hardly un￾derstand a thing?
79. Whatever good happens to you is from Al￾lah, and whatever bad happens to you is from 
your own self. We sent you to humanity as a 
messenger, and Allah is Witness enough.
80. Whoever obeys the Messenger is obeying 
Allah. And whoever turns away—We did not 
send you as a watcher over them.
31
4. WOMEN (an-Nisa’)
81. They profess obedience, but when they 
leave your presence, some of them conspire 
something contrary to what you said. But Al￾lah writes down what they conspire. So avoid 
them, and put your trust in Allah. Allah is 
Guardian enough.
82. Do they not ponder the Quran? Had it 
been from any other than Allah, they would 
have found in it much discrepancy.
83. When some news of security or alarm 
comes their way, they broadcast it. But had 
they referred it to the Messenger, and to those 
in authority among them, those who can 
draw conclusions from it would have com￾prehended it. Were it not for Allah’s blessing 
and mercy upon you, you would have fol￾lowed the Devil, except for a few.
84. So fight in the cause of Allah; you are re￾sponsible only for yourself. And rouse the be￾lievers. Perhaps Allah will restrain the might 
of those who disbelieve. Allah is Stronger in 
Might, and More Punishing.
85. Whoever intercedes for a good cause has a 
share in it, and whoever intercedes for an evil 
cause shares in its burdens. Allah keeps watch 
over everything.
86. When you are greeted with a greeting, re￾spond with a better greeting, or return it. Al￾lah keeps count of everything.
87. Allah—there is no god except He. He will 
gather you to the Day of Resurrection, in 
which there is no doubt. And who speaks 
more truly than Allah?
88. What is the matter with you, divided into 
two factions regarding the hypocrites, when 
Allah Himself has overwhelmed them on ac￾count of what they did? Do you want to guide 
those whom Allah has led astray? Whomever 
Allah leads astray—you will never find for 
him a way.
89. They would love to see you disbelieve, just 
as they disbelieve, so you would become 
equal. So do not befriend any of them, unless 
they emigrate in the way of Allah. If they turn 
away, seize them and execute them wherever 
you may find them; and do not take from 
among them allies or supporters.
90. Except those who join people with whom 
you have a treaty, or those who come to you 
reluctant to fight you or fight their own peo￾ple. Had Allah willed, He would have given 
them power over you, and they would have 
fought you. If they withdraw from you, and 
do not fight you, and offer you peace, then 
Allah assigns no excuse for you against them.
91. You will find others who want security 
from you, and security from their own peo￾ple. But whenever they are tempted into civil 
discord, they plunge into it. So if they do not 
withdraw from you, nor offer you peace, nor 
restrain their hands, seize them and execute 
them wherever you find them. Against these, 
We have given you clear authorization.
92. Never should a believer kill another be￾liever, unless by error. Anyone who kills a be￾liever by error must set free a believing slave, 
and pay compensation to the victim’s family, 
unless they remit it as charity. If the victim 
belonged to a people who are hostile to you, 
but is a believer, then the compensation is to 
free a believing slave. If he belonged to a peo￾ple with whom you have a treaty, then com￾pensation should be handed over to his fam￾ily, and a believing slave set free. Anyone who 
lacks the means must fast for two consecutive 
months, by way of repentance to Allah. Allah 
is All-Knowing, Most Wise.
93. Whoever kills a believer deliberately, the 
penalty for him is Hell, where he will remain 
forever. And Allah will be angry with him, 
and will curse him, and will prepare for him 
a terrible punishment. 
94. O you who believe! When you journey in 
the way of Allah, investigate, and do not say 
to him who offers you peace, “You are not a 
believer,” aspiring for the goods of this world. 
With Allah are abundant riches. You your￾selves were like this before, and Allah be￾stowed favor on you; so investigate. Allah is 
well aware of what you do.
32
4. WOMEN (an-Nisa’)
95. Not equal are the inactive among the be￾lievers—except the disabled—and the striv￾ers in the cause of Allah with their posses￾sions and their persons. Allah prefers the 
strivers with their possessions and their per￾sons above the inactive, by a degree. But Al￾lah has promised goodness to both. Yet Allah 
favors the strivers, over the inactive, with a 
great reward.
96. Degrees from Him, and forgiveness, and 
mercy. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
97. While the angels are removing the souls of 
those who have wronged themselves, they 
will say, “What was the matter with you?” 
They will say, “We were oppressed in the 
land.” They will say, “Was Allah’s earth not 
vast enough for you to emigrate in it?” 
These—their refuge is Hell. What a wretched 
retreat!
98. Except for the weak among men, and 
women, and children who have no means to 
act, and no means to find a way out.
99. These—Allah may well pardon them. Allah 
is Pardoning and Forgiving.
100. Anyone who emigrates for the sake of Al￾lah will find on earth many places of refuge, 
and plentitude. Anyone who leaves his home, 
emigrating to Allah and His Messenger, and 
then is overtaken by death, his compensation 
falls on Allah. Allah is Forgiver, Most Merci￾ful.
101. When you travel in the land, there is no 
blame on you for shortening the prayers, if 
you fear that the disbelievers may harm you. 
The disbelievers are your manifest enemies.
102. When you are among them, and you stand 
to lead them in prayer, let a group of them 
stand with you, and let them hold their weap￾ons. Then, when they have done their pros￾trations, let them withdraw to the rear, and 
let another group, that have not prayed yet, 
come forward and pray with you; and let 
them take their precautions and their weap￾ons. Those who disbelieve would like you to 
neglect your weapons and your equipment, 
so they can attack you in a single assault. You 
commit no error, if you are hampered by rain 
or are sick, by putting down your weapons; 
but take precautions. Indeed, Allah has pre￾pared for the disbelievers a demeaning pun￾ishment.
103. When you have completed the prayer, re￾member Allah, standing, or sitting, or on 
your sides. And when you feel secure, per￾form the prayer. The prayer is obligatory for 
believers at specific times.
104. And do not falter in the pursuit of the en￾emy. If you are aching, they are aching as you 
are aching, but you expect from Allah what 
they cannot expect. Allah is Knowledgeable 
and Wise.
105. We have revealed to you the Scripture, 
with the truth, so that you judge between 
people in accordance with what Allah has 
shown you. And do not be an advocate for the 
traitors.
106. And ask Allah for forgiveness. Allah is 
Forgiver and Merciful.
107. And do not argue on behalf of those who 
deceive themselves. Allah does not love the 
deceitful sinner.
108. They hide from the people, but they can￾not hide from Allah. He is with them, as they 
plot by night with words He does not ap￾prove. Allah comprehends what they do.
109. There you are, arguing on their behalf in 
the present life, but who will argue with Allah 
on their behalf on the Day of Resurrection? 
Or who will be their representative?
110. Whoever commits evil, or wrongs his soul, 
then implores Allah for forgiveness, will find 
Allah Forgiving and Merciful.
111. And Whoever earns a sin, earns it against 
himself. Allah is Aware and Wise.
112. And whoever commits a mistake, or a sin, 
and then blames it on an innocent person, 
has taken a slander and a clear sin.
113. Were it not for Allah’s grace towards you, 
and His mercy, a faction of them would have 
managed to mislead you. But they only mis￾lead themselves, and they cannot harm you in 
33
4. WOMEN (an-Nisa’)
any way. Allah has revealed to you the Scrip￾ture and wisdom, and has taught you what 
you did not know. Allah’s goodness towards 
you is great.
114. There is no good in much of their private 
counsels, except for him who advocates char￾ity, or kindness, or reconciliation between 
people. Whoever does that, seeking Allah’s 
approval, We will give him a great compen￾sation.
115. Whoever makes a breach with the Messen￾ger, after the guidance has become clear to 
him, and follows other than the path of the 
believers, We will direct him in the direction 
he has chosen, and commit him to Hell—
what a terrible destination!
116. Allah will not forgive that partners be as￾sociated with Him; but will forgive anything 
less than that, to whomever He wills. Anyone 
who ascribes partners to Allah has strayed 
into far error.
117. They invoke in His stead only females. In 
fact, they invoke none but a rebellious devil.
118. Allah has cursed him. And he said, “I will 
take to myself my due share of Your serv￾ants.”
119. “And I will mislead them, and I will entice 
them, and I will prompt them to slit the ears 
of cattle, and I will prompt them to alter the 
creation of Allah.” Whoever takes Satan as a 
lord, instead of Allah, has surely suffered a 
profound loss.
120. He promises them, and he raises their ex￾pectations, but Satan promises them nothing 
but delusions.
121. These—their place is Hell, and they will 
find no escape from it.
122. But as for those who believe and do right￾eous deeds, We will admit them into gardens 
beneath which rivers flow, where they will 
abide forever. The promise of Allah is true—
and who is more truthful in speech than Al￾lah?
123. It is not in accordance with your wishes, 
nor in accordance with the wishes of the Peo￾ple of the Scripture. Whoever works evil will 
pay for it, and will not find for himself, be￾sides Allah, any protector or savior.
124. But whoever works righteousness, 
whether male or female, and is a believer—
those will enter Paradise, and will not be 
wronged a whit.
125. And who is better in religion than he who 
submits himself wholly to Allah, and is a doer 
of good, and follows the faith of Abraham the 
Monotheist? Allah has chosen Abraham for a 
friend.
126. To Allah belongs what is in the heavens 
and what is on earth, and Allah encompasses 
everything.
127. They ask you for a ruling about women. 
Say, “Allah gives you a ruling about them, 
and so does what is stated to you in the Book 
about widowed women from whom you 
withhold what is decreed for them, yet you 
desire to marry them, and about helpless chil￾dren: that you should treat the orphans 
fairly.” Whatever good you do, Allah knows 
it.
128. If a woman fears maltreatment or deser￾tion from her husband, there is no fault in 
them if they reconcile their differences, for 
reconciliation is best. Souls are prone to ava￾rice; yet if you do what is good, and practice 
piety—Allah is Cognizant of what you do.
129. You will not be able to treat women with 
equal fairness, no matter how much you de￾sire it. But do not be so biased as to leave an￾other suspended. If you make amends, and 
act righteously—Allah is Forgiving and Mer￾ciful.
130. And if they separate, Allah will enrich each 
from His abundance. Allah is Bounteous and 
Wise.
131. To Allah belongs everything in the heav￾ens and everything on earth. We have in￾structed those who were given the Book be￾fore you, and you, to be conscious of Allah. 
34
4. WOMEN (an-Nisa’)
But if you refuse—to Allah belongs every￾thing in the heavens and everything on earth. 
Allah is in no need, Praiseworthy.
132. To Allah belongs everything in the heav￾ens and everything on earth. Allah suffices as 
Manager.
133. If He wills, He can do away with you, O 
people, and bring others. Allah is Able to do 
that.
134. Whoever desires the reward of this 
world—with Allah is the reward of this world 
and the next. Allah is All-Hearing, All-See￾ing.
135. O you who believe! Stand firmly for jus￾tice, as witnesses to Allah, even if against 
yourselves, or your parents, or your relatives. 
Whether one is rich or poor, Allah takes care 
of both. So do not follow your desires, lest 
you swerve. If you deviate, or turn away—
then Allah is Aware of what you do.
136. O you who believe! Believe in Allah and 
His messenger, and the Book He sent down 
to His messenger, and the Book He sent 
down before. Whoever rejects Allah, His an￾gels, His Books, His messengers, and the Last 
Day, has strayed far in error.
137. Those who believe, then disbelieve, then 
believe, then disbelieve, then increase in dis￾belief, Allah will not forgive them, nor will He 
guide them to a way.
138. Inform the hypocrites that they will have a 
painful punishment.
139. Those who ally themselves with the disbe￾lievers instead of the believers. Do they seek 
glory in them? All glory belongs to Allah.
140. He has revealed to you in the Book that 
when you hear Allah’s revelations being re￾jected, or ridiculed, do not sit with them until 
they engage in some other subject. Other￾wise, you would be like them. Allah will 
gather the hypocrites and the disbelievers, 
into Hell, altogether.
141. Those who lie in wait for you: if you attain 
victory from Allah, they say, “Were we not 
with you?” But if the disbelievers get a turn, 
they say, “Did we not side with you, and de￾fend you from the believers?” Allah will judge 
between you on the Day of Resurrection; and 
Allah will give the disbelievers no means of 
overcoming the believers.
142. The hypocrites try to deceive Allah, but He 
is deceiving them. And when they stand for 
prayer, they stand lazily, showing off in front 
of people, and remembering Allah only a lit￾tle.
143. Wavering in between, neither with these, 
nor with those. Whomever Allah sends 
astray, you will never find for him a way.
144. O you who believe! Do not befriend disbe￾lievers rather than believers. Do you want to 
give Allah a clear case against you?
145. The hypocrites will be in the lowest level 
of the Fire, and you will find no helper for 
them.
146. Except those who repent, and reform, and 
hold fast to Allah, and dedicate their religion 
to Allah alone. These are with the believers; 
and Allah will give the believers a great re￾ward.
147. What would Allah accomplish by your 
punishment, if you have given thanks, and 
have believed? Allah is Appreciative and 
Cognizant.
148. Allah does not like the public uttering of 
bad language, unless someone was wronged. 
Allah is Hearing and Knowing.
149. If you let a good deed be shown, or conceal 
it, or pardon an offense—Allah is Pardoning 
and Capable.
150. Those who disbelieve in Allah and His 
messengers, and want to separate between 
Allah and His messengers, and say, “We be￾lieve in some, and reject some,” and wish to 
take a path in between.
151. These are the unbelievers, truly. We have 
prepared for the unbelievers a shameful pun￾ishment.
35
4. WOMEN (an-Nisa’)
152. As for those who believe in Allah and His 
messengers, and make no distinction be￾tween any of them—He will give them their 
rewards. Allah is Forgiver and Merciful.
153. The People of the Scripture challenge you 
to bring down to them a book from the sky. 
They had asked Moses for something even 
greater. They said, “Show us Allah plainly.” 
The thunderbolt struck them for their wick￾edness. Then they took the calf for worship, 
even after the clear proofs had come to them. 
Yet We pardoned that, and We gave Moses a 
clear authority.
154. And We raised the Mount above them in 
accordance with their covenant, and We said 
to them, “Enter the gate humbly”, and We 
said to them, “Do not violate the Sabbath”, 
and We received from them a solemn pledge.
155. But for their violation of their covenant, 
and their denial of Allah’s revelations, and 
their killing of the prophets unjustly, and 
their saying, “Our minds are closed.” In fact, 
Allah has sealed them for their disbelief, so 
they do not believe, except for a few.
156. And for their faithlessness, and their say￾ing against Mary a monstrous slander.
157. And for their saying, “We have killed the 
Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, the Messen￾ger of Allah.” In fact, they did not kill him, 
nor did they crucify him, but it appeared to 
them as if they did. Indeed, those who differ 
about him are in doubt about it. They have 
no knowledge of it, except the following of as￾sumptions. Certainly, they did not kill him.
158. Rather, Allah raised him up to Himself. 
Allah is Mighty and Wise.
159. There is none from the People of the 
Scripture but will believe in him before his 
death, and on the Day of Resurrection he will 
be a witness against them.
160. Due to wrongdoing on the part of the 
Jews, We forbade them good things that used 
to be lawful for them; and for deterring many 
from Allah’s path.
161. And for their taking usury, although they 
were forbidden it; and for their consuming 
people's wealth dishonestly. We have pre￾pared for the faithless among them a painful 
torment.
162. But those among them firmly rooted in 
knowledge, and the believers, believe in what 
was revealed to you, and in what was revealed 
before you; and the observers of prayers, and 
the givers of charity, and the believers in Al￾lah and the Last Day—upon these We will be￾stow an immense reward.
163. We have inspired you, as We had inspired 
Noah and the prophets after him. And We in￾spired Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and 
Jacob, and the Patriarchs, and Jesus, and Job, 
and Jonah, and Aaron, and Solomon. And 
We gave David the Psalms.
164. Some messengers We have already told 
you about, while some messengers We have 
not told you about. And Allah spoke to Mo￾ses directly.
165. Messengers delivering good news, and 
bringing warnings; so that people may have 
no excuse before Allah after the coming of 
the messengers. Allah is Powerful and Wise.
166. But Allah bears witness to what He re￾vealed to you. He revealed it with His 
knowledge. And the angels bear witness. 
Though Allah is a sufficient witness.
167. Those who disbelieve and repel from Al￾lah’s path have gone far astray.
168. Those who disbelieve and transgress; Al￾lah is not about to forgive them, nor will He 
guide them to any path.
169. Except to the path of Hell, where they will 
dwell forever. And that is easy for Allah.
170. O people! The Messenger has come to you 
with the truth from your Lord, so believe—
that is best for you. But if you disbelieve, to 
Allah belongs everything in the heavens and 
the earth. Allah is Omniscient and Wise.
171. O People of the Scripture! Do not exagger￾ate in your religion, and do not say about Al￾lah except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, the 
son of Mary, is the Messenger of Allah, and 
His Word that He conveyed to Mary, and a 
36
5. THE TABLE (al-Ma’idah)
Spirit from Him. So believe in Allah and His 
messengers, and do not say, “Three.” Re￾frain—it is better for you. Allah is only one 
God. Glory be to Him—that He should have 
a son. To Him belongs everything in the 
heavens and the earth, and Allah is a suffi￾cient Protector.
172. The Messiah does not disdain to be a serv￾ant of Allah, nor do the favored angels. Who￾ever disdains His worship, and is too arro￾gant—He will round them up to Himself al￾together.
173. But as for those who believe and do good 
works, He will pay them their wages in full, 
and will increase His grace for them. But as 
for those who disdain and are too proud, He 
will punish them with an agonizing punish￾ment. And they will find for themselves, 
apart from Allah, no lord and no savior.
174. O people! A proof has come to you from 
your Lord, and We sent down to you a clear 
light.
175. As for those who believe in Allah, and hold 
fast to Him, He will admit them into mercy 
and grace from Him, and will guide them to 
Himself in a straight path.
176. They ask you for a ruling. Say, “Allah gives 
you a ruling concerning the person who has 
neither parents nor children.” If a man dies, 
and leaves no children, and he had a sister, 
she receives one-half of what he leaves. And 
he inherits from her if she leaves no children. 
But if there are two sisters, they receive two￾thirds of what he leaves. If the siblings are 
men and women, the male receives the share 
of two females.” Allah makes things clear for 
you, lest you err. Allah is Aware of every￾thing.
5. THE TABLE
(al-Ma’idah)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. O you who believe! Fulfill your commit￾ments. Livestock animals are permitted for 
you, except those specified to you; but not 
wild game while you are in pilgrim sanctity. 
Allah decrees whatever He wills.
2. O you who believe! Do not violate Allah’s 
sacraments, nor the Sacred Month, nor the 
offerings, nor the garlanded, nor those head￾ing for the Sacred House seeking blessings 
from their Lord and approval. When you 
have left the pilgrim sanctity, you may hunt. 
And let not the hatred of people who barred 
you from the Sacred Mosque incite you to ag￾gression. And cooperate with one another in 
virtuous conduct and conscience, and do not 
cooperate with one another in sin and hostil￾ity. And fear Allah. Allah is severe in punish￾ment.
3. Prohibited for you are carrion, blood, the 
flesh of swine, and animals dedicated to other 
than Allah; also the flesh of animals stran￾gled, killed violently, killed by a fall, gored to 
death, mangled by wild animals—except 
what you rescue, and animals sacrificed on 
altars; and the practice of drawing lots. For it 
is immoral. Today, those who disbelieve have 
despaired of your religion, so do not fear 
them, but fear Me. Today I have perfected 
your religion for you, and have completed 
My favor upon you, and have approved Islam 
as a religion for you. But whoever is com￾pelled by hunger, with no intent of wrongdo￾ing—Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
4. They ask you what is permitted for them. 
Say, “Permitted for you are all good things, 
including what trained dogs and falcons 
catch for you.” You train them according to 
what Allah has taught you. So eat from what 
they catch for you, and pronounce Allah’s 
name over it. And fear Allah. Allah is Swift in 
reckoning.
5. Today all good things are made lawful for 
you. And the food of those given the Scrip￾ture is lawful for you, and your food is lawful 
for them. So are chaste believing women, and 
chaste women from the people who were 
given the Scripture before you, provided you 
give them their dowries, and take them in 
marriage, not in adultery, nor as mistresses. 
But whoever rejects faith, his work will be in 
37
5. THE TABLE (al-Ma’idah)
vain, and in the Hereafter he will be among 
the losers.
6. O you who believe! When you rise to pray, 
wash your faces and your hands and arms to 
the elbows, and wipe your heads, and your 
feet to the ankles. If you had intercourse, then 
purify yourselves. If you are ill, or travelling, 
or one of you returns from the toilet, or you 
had contact with women, and could not find 
water, then use some clean sand and wipe 
your faces and hands with it. Allah does not 
intend to burden you, but He intends to pu￾rify you, and to complete His blessing upon 
you, that you may be thankful.
7. And Remember Allah’s blessings upon you, 
and His covenant which He covenanted with 
you; when you said, “We hear and we obey.” 
And remain conscious of Allah, for Allah 
knows what the hearts contain.
8. O you who believe! Be upright to Allah, wit￾nessing with justice; and let not the hatred of 
a certain people prevent you from acting 
justly. Adhere to justice, for that is nearer to 
piety; and fear Allah. Allah is informed of 
what you do.
9. Allah has promised those who believe and 
work righteousness: they will have for￾giveness and a great reward.
10. As for those who disbelieve and reject Our 
revelations—these are the inmates of Hell.
11. O you who believe! Remember Allah's 
blessings upon you; when certain people in￾tended to extend their hands against you, and 
He restrained their hands from you. So rev￾erence Allah, and in Allah let the believers 
put their trust.
12. Allah received a pledge from the Children 
of Israel, and We raised among them twelve 
chiefs. Allah said, “I am with you; if you per￾form the prayer, and pay the alms, and be￾lieve in My messengers and support them, 
and lend Allah a loan of righteousness; I will 
remit your sins, and admit you into Gardens 
beneath which rivers flow. But whoever 
among you disbelieves afterwards has strayed 
from the right way.”
13. Because of their breaking their pledge, We 
cursed them, and made their hearts hard. 
They twist the words out of their context, and 
they disregarded some of what they were re￾minded of. You will always witness deceit 
from them, except for a few of them. But par￾don them, and overlook. Allah loves the do￾ers of good.
14. And from those who say, “We are Chris￾tians,” We received their pledge, but they ne￾glected some of what they were reminded of. 
So We provoked enmity and hatred among 
them until the Day of Resurrection; Allah will 
then inform them of what they used to craft.
15. O People of the Book! Our Messenger has 
come to you, clarifying for you much of what 
you kept hidden of the Book, and overlook￾ing much. A light from Allah has come to 
you, and a clear Book.
16. Allah guides with it whoever follows His 
approval to the ways of peace, and He brings 
them out of darkness into light, by His per￾mission, and He guides them in a straight 
path.
17. They disbelieve those who say, “Allah is the 
Christ, the son of Mary.” Say, “Who can pre￾vent Allah, if He willed, from annihilating the 
Christ son of Mary, and his mother, and eve￾ryone on earth?” To Allah belongs the sover￾eignty of the heavens and the earth and what 
is between them. He creates whatever He 
wills, and Allah has power over everything.
18. The Jews and the Christians say, “We are 
the children of Allah, and His beloved.” Say, 
“Why then does He punish you for your 
sins?” In fact, you are humans from among 
those He created. He forgives whom He wills, 
and He punishes whom He wills. To Allah 
belongs the dominion of the heavens and the 
earth and what lies between them, and to 
Him is the return.
19. O People of the Book! Our Messenger has 
come to you, making things clear to you—af￾ter a cessation of messengers—so that you 
cannot say, “No preacher has come to us, and 
no warner.” In fact, a preacher has come to 
38
5. THE TABLE (al-Ma’idah)
you, and a warner; and Allah is Capable of 
everything.
20. When Moses said to his people, “O my 
people, remember Allah’s blessings upon 
you, when He placed prophets among you, 
and made you kings, and gave you what He 
never gave any other people.”
21. “O my people, enter the Holy Land which 
Allah has assigned for you, and do not turn 
back, lest you return as losers.”
22. They said, “O Moses, there are tyrannical 
people in it; we will not enter it until they 
leave it. If they leave it, we will be entering.”
23. Two men of those who feared, but whom 
Allah had blessed, said, “Go at them by the 
gate; and when you have entered it, you will 
prevail. And put your trust in Allah, if you are 
believers.”
24. They said, “O Moses, we will not enter it, 
ever, as long as they are in it. So go ahead, you 
and your Lord, and fight. We are staying right 
here.”
25. He said, “My Lord! I have control only over 
myself and my brother, so separate between 
us and between the wicked people.”
26. He said, “It is forbidden for them for forty 
years. They will wander aimlessly in the land. 
So do not grieve over the defiant people.”
27. And relate to them the true story of Adam's 
two sons: when they offered an offering, and 
it was accepted from one of them, but it was 
not accepted from the other. He Said, “I will 
kill you.” He Said, “Allah accepts only from 
the righteous.”
28. “If you extend your hand to kill me, I will 
not extend my hand to kill you; for I fear Al￾lah, Lord of the Worlds.”
29. “I would rather you bear my sin and your 
sin, and you become among the inmates of 
the Fire. Such is the reward for the evildoers.”
30. Then His soul prompted him to kill his 
brother, so he killed him, and became one of 
the losers.
31. Then Allah sent a raven digging the 
ground, to show him how to cover his broth￾er's corpse. He said, “Woe to me! I was unable 
to be like this raven, and bury my brother's 
corpse.” So he became full of regrets.
32. Because of that We ordained for the Chil￾dren of Israel: that whoever kills a person—
unless it is for murder or corruption on 
earth—it is as if he killed the whole of man￾kind; and whoever saves it, it is as if he saved 
the whole of mankind. Our messengers came 
to them with clarifications, but even after 
that, many of them continue to commit ex￾cesses in the land.
33. The punishment for those who fight Allah 
and His Messenger, and strive to spread cor￾ruption on earth, is that they be killed, or cru￾cified, or have their hands and feet cut off on 
opposite sides, or be banished from the land. 
That is to disgrace them in this life; and in the 
Hereafter they will have a terrible punish￾ment.
34. Except for those who repent before you ap￾prehend them. So know that Allah is Forgiv￾ing and Merciful.
35. O you who believe! Be conscious of Allah, 
and seek the means of approach to Him, and 
strive in His cause, so that you may succeed.
36. As for those who disbelieve, even if they 
owned everything on earth, and the like of it 
with it, and they offered it to ransom them￾selves from the torment of the Day of Resur￾rection, it will not be accepted from them. 
For them is a painful punishment.
37. They will want to leave the Fire, but they 
will not leave it. For them is a lasting punish￾ment.
38. As for the thief, whether male or female, 
cut their hands as a penalty for what they 
have reaped—a deterrent from Allah. Allah is 
Mighty and Wise.
39. But whoever repents after his crime, and 
reforms, Allah will accept his repentance. Al￾lah is Forgiving and Merciful.
40. Do you not know that to Allah belongs the 
kingdom of the heavens and the earth? He 
39
5. THE TABLE (al-Ma’idah)
punishes whom He wills, and He forgives 
whom He wills. And Allah is Capable of eve￾rything.
41. O Messenger! Do not let those who are 
quick to disbelief grieve you—from among 
those who say with their mouths, “We be￾lieve,” but their hearts do not believe; and 
from among the Jews—listeners to lies, lis￾teners to other people who did not come to 
you. They distort words from their places, 
and they say, “If you are given this, accept it; 
but if you are not given it, beware.” Whom￾ever Allah has willed to divert, you have 
nothing for him from Allah. Those are they 
whose hearts Allah does not intend to purify. 
For them is disgrace in this world, and for 
them is a great punishment in the Hereafter.
42. Listeners to falsehoods, eaters of illicit 
earnings. If they come to you, judge between 
them, or turn away from them. If you turn 
away from them, they will not harm you in 
the least. But if you judge, judge between 
them equitably. Allah loves the equitable.
43. But why do they come to you for judgment, 
when they have the Torah, in which is Allah’s 
Law? Yet they turn away after that. These are 
not believers.
44. We have revealed the Torah, wherein is 
guidance and light. The submissive prophets 
ruled the Jews according to it, so did the rab￾bis and the scholars, as they were required to 
protect Allah’s Book, and were witnesses to it. 
So do not fear people, but fear Me. And do 
not sell My revelations for a cheap price. 
Those who do not rule according to what Al￾lah revealed are the unbelievers.
45. And We wrote for them in it: a life for a life, 
an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for 
an ear, a tooth for a tooth, and an equal 
wound for a wound; but whoever forgoes it 
in charity, it will serve as atonement for him. 
Those who do not rule according to what Al￾lah revealed are the evildoers.
46. In their footsteps, We sent Jesus son of 
Mary, fulfilling the Torah that preceded him; 
and We gave him the Gospel, wherein is 
guidance and light, and confirming the To￾rah that preceded him, and guidance and 
counsel for the righteous.
47. So let the people of the Gospel rule accord￾ing to what Allah revealed in it. Those who 
do not rule according to what Allah revealed 
are the sinners.
48. And We revealed to you the Book, with 
truth, confirming the Scripture that preceded 
it, and superseding it. So judge between them 
according to what Allah revealed, and do not 
follow their desires if they differ from the 
truth that has come to you. For each of you 
We have assigned a law and a method. Had 
Allah willed, He could have made you a single 
nation, but He tests you through what He has 
given you. So compete in righteousness. To 
Allah is your return, all of you; then He will 
inform you of what you had disputed.
49. And judge between them according to 
what Allah revealed, and do not follow their 
desires. And beware of them, lest they lure 
you away from some of what Allah has re￾vealed to you. But if they turn away, know 
that Allah intends to strike them with some 
of their sins. In fact, a great many people are 
corrupt.
50. Is it the laws of the time of ignorance that 
they desire? Who is better than Allah in judg￾ment for people who are certain?
51. O you who believe! Do not take the Jews 
and the Christians as allies; some of them are 
allies of one another. Whoever of you allies 
himself with them is one of them. Allah does 
not guide the wrongdoing people.
52. You will see those in whose hearts is sick￾ness racing towards them. They say, “We fear 
the wheel of fate may turn against us.” But 
perhaps Allah will bring about victory, or 
some event of His making; thereupon they 
will regret what they concealed within them￾selves.
53. Those who believe will say, “Are these the 
ones who swore by Allah with their strongest 
oaths that they are with you?” Their works 
have failed, so they became losers.

5. THE TABLE (al-Ma’idah)
54. O you who believe! Whoever of you goes 
back on his religion—Allah will bring a peo￾ple whom He loves and who love Him, kind 
towards the believers, stern with the disbe￾lievers. They strive in the way of Allah, and 
do not fear the blame of the critic. That is the 
grace of Allah; He bestows it upon whomever 
He wills. Allah is Embracing and Knowing.
55. Your allies are Allah, and His Messenger, 
and those who believe—those who pray reg￾ularly, and give charity, and bow down.
56. Whoever allies himself with Allah, and His 
Messenger, and those who believe—surely 
the Party of Allah is the victorious.
57. O you who believe! Do not befriend those 
who take your religion in mockery and as a 
sport, be they from among those who were 
given the Scripture before you, or the disbe￾lievers. And obey Allah, if you are believers.
58. When you call to the prayer, they take it as 
a joke and a trifle. That is because they are 
people who do not reason.
59. Say, “O People of the Scripture! Do you re￾sent us only because we believe in Allah, and 
in what was revealed to us, and in what was 
revealed previously; and most of you are sin￾ners?”
60. Say, “Shall I inform you of worse than that 
for retribution from Allah? He whom Allah 
has cursed, and with whom He became an￾gry; and He turned some of them into apes, 
and swine, and idol worshipers. These are in 
a worse position, and further away from the 
right way.”
61. When they come to you, they say, “We be￾lieve,” though they have entered with disbe￾lief, and they have departed with it. But Allah 
is well aware of what they hide.
62. You see many of them competing with one 
another in sin and hostility, and their con￾suming of what is illicit. What they have been 
doing is truly evil.
63. Why do the rabbis and the priests not pre￾vent them from speaking sinfully and from 
consuming forbidden wealth? Evil is what 
they have been doing.
64. The Jews say, “Allah’s hand is tied.” It is 
their hands that are tied, and they are cursed 
for what they say. In fact, His hands are out￾stretched; He gives as He wills. Certainly, 
what was revealed to your from your Lord 
will increase many of them in defiance and 
blasphemy. And We placed between them 
enmity and hatred, until the Day of Resurrec￾tion. Whenever they kindle the fire of war, 
Allah extinguishes it. And they strive to 
spread corruption on earth. Allah does not 
love the corrupters.
65. Had the People of the Scriputure believed 
and been righteous, We would have remitted 
their sins, and admitted them into the Gar￾dens of Bliss.
66. Had they observed the Torah, and the Gos￾pel, and what was revealed to them from their 
Lord, they would have consumed amply from 
above them, and from beneath their feet. 
Among them is a moderate community, but 
evil is what many of them are doing. 
67. O Messenger, convey what was revealed to 
you from your Lord. But if you do not, then 
you would not have delivered His message. 
And Allah will protect you from the people. 
Allah does not guide the disbelieving people.
68. Say, “O People of the Scripture! You have 
no basis until you uphold the Torah, and the 
Gospel, and what is revealed to you from 
your Lord.” But what is revealed to you from 
your Lord will increase many of them in re￾bellion and disbelief, so do not be sorry for 
the disbelieving people.
69. Those who believe, and the Jews, and the 
Sabians, and the Christians—whoever be￾lieves in Allah and the Last Day, and does 
what is right—they have nothing to fear, nor 
shall they grieve.
70. We made a covenant with the Children of 
Israel, and We sent to them messengers. 
Whenever a messenger came to them with 
what their souls did not desire, some of them 
they accused of lying, and others they put to 
death.
41
5. THE TABLE (al-Ma’idah)
71. They assumed there would be no punish￾ment, so they turned blind and deaf. Then Al￾lah redeemed them, but then again many of 
them turned blind and deaf. But Allah is See￾ing of what they do.
72. They disbelieve those who say, “Allah is the 
Messiah the son of Mary.” But the Messiah 
himself said, “O Children of Israel, worship 
Allah, my Lord and your Lord. Whoever as￾sociates others with Allah, Allah has forbid￾den him Paradise, and his dwelling is the Fire. 
The wrongdoers have no saviors.”
73. They disbelieve those who say, “Allah is the 
third of three.” But there is no deity except 
the One God. If they do not refrain from what 
they say, a painful torment will befall those 
among them who disbelieve.
74. Will they not repent to Allah and ask His 
forgiveness? Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
75. The Messiah son of Mary was only a mes￾senger, before whom other Messengers had 
passed away, and his mother was a woman of 
truth. They both used to eat food. Note how 
We make clear the revelations to them; then 
note how deluded they are.
76. Say, “Do you worship, besides Allah, what 
has no power to harm or benefit you?” But 
Allah: He is the Hearer, the Knower.
77. Say, “O People of the Scripture! Do not ex￾aggerate in your religion beyond the truth; 
and do not follow the opinions of people who 
went astray before, and misled many, and 
themselves strayed off the balanced way.”
78. Cursed were those who disbelieved from 
among the Children of Israel by the tongue of 
David and Jesus son of Mary. That is because 
they rebelled and used to transgress.
79. They used not to prevent one another from 
the wrongs they used to commit. Evil is what 
they used to do.
80. You will see many of them befriending 
those who disbelieve. Terrible is what their 
souls prompts them to do. The wrath of Allah 
fell upon them, and in the torment they will 
remain.
81. Had they believed in Allah and the 
Prophet, and in what was revealed to him, 
they would not have befriended them. But 
many of them are immoral.
82. You will find that the people most hostile 
towards the believers are the Jews and the 
polytheists. And you will find that the nearest 
in affection towards the believers are those 
who say, “We are Christians.” That is because 
among them are priests and monks, and they 
are not arrogant.
83. And when they hear what was revealed to 
the Messenger, you see their eyes overflowing 
with tears, as they recognize the truth in it. 
They say, “Our Lord, we have believed, so 
count us among the witnesses.”
84. “And why should we not believe in Allah, 
and in the truth that has come to us, and hope 
that our Lord will include us among the 
righteous people?”
85. Allah will reward them for what they say—
Gardens beneath which rivers flow, where 
they will stay forever. Such is the reward of 
the righteous.
86. But as for those who disbelieve and deny 
Our signs—these are the inmates of the Fire.
87. O you who believe! Do not prohibit the 
good things Allah has permitted for you, and 
do not commit aggression. Allah does not 
love the aggressors.
88. And eat of the lawful and good things Allah 
has provided for you; and be conscious of Al￾lah, in whom you are believers.
89. Allah does not hold you accountable for 
your unintended oaths, but He holds you ac￾countable for your binding oaths. The atone￾ment for it is by feeding ten needy people 
from the average of what you feed your fam￾ilies, or by clothing them, or by freeing a 
slave. Anyone who lacks the means shall fast 
for three days. That is the atonement for 
breaking your oaths when you have sworn 
them. So keep your oaths. Thus Allah makes 
clear His Revelations to you, that you may be 
grateful.
42
5. THE TABLE (al-Ma’idah)
90. O you who believe! Intoxicants, gambling, 
idolatry, and divination are abominations of 
Satan’s doing. Avoid them, so that you may 
prosper.
91. Satan wants to provoke strife and hatred 
among you through intoxicants and gam￾bling, and to prevent you from the remem￾brance of Allah, and from prayer. Will you 
not desist?
92. Obey Allah and obey the Messenger, and 
be cautious. If you turn away—know that the 
duty of Our Messenger is clear communica￾tion.
93. Those who believe and do righteous deeds 
will not be blamed for what they may have 
eaten, provided they obey, and believe, and 
do good deeds, then maintain piety and faith, 
then remain righteous and charitable. Allah 
loves the charitable.
94. O you who believe! Allah will test you with 
something of the game your hands and spears 
obtain, that Allah may know who fears Him 
at heart. Whoever commits aggression after 
that will have a painful punishment.
95. O you who believe! do not kill game while 
you are in pilgrim sanctity. Whoever of you 
kills any intentionally, its penalty shall be a 
domestic animal comparable to what he 
killed, as determined by two honest persons 
among you—an offering delivered to the 
Kaabah. Or he may atone by feeding the 
needy, or its equivalent in fasting, so that he 
may taste the consequences of his conduct. 
Allah forgives what is past. But whoever re￾peats, Allah will take revenge on him. Allah is 
Almighty, Avenger.
96. Permitted for you is the catch of sea, and 
its food—as sustenance for you and for trav￾elers. But forbidden for you is the game of 
land while you are in pilgrim sanctity. And 
fear Allah, to whom you will be gathered.
97. Allah has appointed the Kaabah, the Sacred 
House, a sanctuary for the people, and the Sa￾cred Month, and the offerings, and the gar￾landed. That you may know that Allah knows 
everything in the heavens and the earth, and 
that Allah is Cognizant of all things.
98. Know that Allah is severe in retribution, 
and that Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
99. The Messenger’s sole duty is to convey. Al￾lah knows what you reveal and what you con￾ceal.
100. Say: “The bad and the good are not equal, 
even though the abundance of the bad may 
impress you. So be conscious of Allah, O you 
who possess intelligence, that you may suc￾ceed.”
101. O you who believe! Do not ask about 
things that would trouble you if disclosed to 
you. But if you were to ask about them while 
the Quran is being revealed, they will become 
obvious to you. Allah forgives that. Allah is 
Forgiving and Clement.
102. A people before you asked about them, but 
then came to reject them. 
103. Allah did not institute the superstitions of 
Bahirah, Saibah, Wasilah, or of Hami; but 
those who disbelieve fabricate lies about Al￾lah—most of them do not understand.
104. And when it is said to them, “Come to 
what Allah has revealed, and to the Messen￾ger,” they say, “Sufficient for us is what we 
found our forefathers upon.” Even if their 
forefathers knew nothing, and were not 
guided?
105. O you who believe! You are responsible 
for your own souls. He who has strayed can￾not harm you if you are guided. To Allah is 
you return, all of you, and He will inform you 
of what you used to do.
106. O you who believe! When death ap￾proaches one of you, let two reliable persons 
from among you act as witnesses to the mak￾ing of a bequest, or two persons from another 
people if you are travelling in the land and the 
event of death approaches you. Engage them 
after the prayer. If you have doubts, let them 
swear by Allah: “We will not sell our testi￾mony for any price, even if he was a near rel￾ative, and we will not conceal Allah’s testi￾mony, for then we would be sinners.”
107. If it is discovered that they are guilty of 
perjury: let two others take their place, two 
43
6. LIVESTOCK (al-An’am)
from among those responsible for the claim, 
and have them swear by Allah, “Our testi￾mony is more truthful than their testimony, 
and we will not be biased, for then we would 
be wrongdoers.”
108. That makes it more likely that they will 
give true testimony, fearing that their oaths 
might be contradicted by subsequent oaths. 
So fear Allah, and listen. Allah does not guide 
the disobedient people.
109. On the Day when Allah will gather the 
messengers, then say, “What response were 
you given?” They will say, “We have no 
knowledge; it is you who are the Knower of 
the unseen.”
110. When Allah will say, “O Jesus son of Mary, 
recall My favor upon you and upon your 
mother, how I supported you with the Holy 
Spirit. You spoke to the people from the crib, 
and in maturity. How I taught you the Scrip￾ture and wisdom, and the Torah and the Gos￾pel. And recall that you molded from clay the 
shape of a bird, by My leave, and then you 
breathed into it, and it became a bird, by My 
leave. And you healed the blind and the lep￾rous, by My leave; and you revived the dead, 
by My leave. And recall that I restrained the 
Children of Israel from you when you 
brought them the clear miracles. But those 
who disbelieved among them said, `This is 
nothing but obvious sorcery.'“
111. “And when I inspired the disciples: `Be￾lieve in Me and in My Messenger.' They said, 
`We have believed, so bear witness that We 
have submitted.'“
112. “And when the disciples said, 'O Jesus son 
of Mary, is your Lord able to bring down for 
us a feast from heaven?' He said, 'Fear Allah, 
if you are believers.'“
113. They said, “We wish to eat from it, so that 
our hearts may be reassured, and know that 
you have told us the truth, and be among 
those who witness it.”
114. Jesus son of Mary said, “O Allah, our Lord, 
send down for us a table from heaven, to be a 
festival for us, for the first of us, and the last 
of us, and a sign from You; and provide for 
us; You are the Best of providers.”
115. Allah said, “I will send it down to you. But 
whoever among you disbelieves thereafter, I 
will punish him with a punishment the like of 
which I never punish any other being.”
116. And Allah will say, “O Jesus son of Mary, 
did you say to the people, `Take me and my 
mother as gods rather than Allah?'“ He will 
say, “Glory be to You! It is not for me to say 
what I have no right to. Had I said it, You 
would have known it. You know what is in 
my soul, and I do not know what is in your 
soul. You are the Knower of the hidden.
117. I only told them what You commanded 
me: that you shall worship Allah, my Lord 
and your Lord. And I was a witness over them 
while I was among them; but when You took 
me to Yourself, you became the Watcher over 
them—You are Witness over everything.
118. If You punish them, they are Your serv￾ants; but if You forgive them, You are the
Mighty and Wise.”
119. Allah will say, “This is a Day when the 
truthful will benefit from their truthfulness.” 
They will have Gardens beneath which rivers 
flow, wherein they will remain forever. Allah 
is pleased with them, and they are pleased 
with Him. That is the great attainment.
120. To Allah belongs the sovereignty of the 
heavens and the earth and what lies in them, 
and He has power over everything.
6. LIVESTOCK
(al-An’am)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Praise be to Allah, Who created the heavens 
and the earth, and made the darkness and the 
light. Yet those who disbelieve ascribe equals 
to their Lord.
2. It is He who created you from clay, then de￾cided a term—a term determined by him. Yet 
you doubt.
44
6. LIVESTOCK (al-An’am)
3. He is Allah in the heavens and the earth. He 
knows what you keep secret and what you 
make public; and He knows what you earn.
4. Not one of their Lord’s signs comes to them, 
but they turn away from it.
5. They denied the truth when it has come to 
them; but soon will reach them the news of 
what they used to ridicule.
6. Have they not considered how many gener￾ations We destroyed before them? We had 
established them on earth more firmly than 
We established you, and We sent the clouds 
pouring down abundant rain on them, and 
We made rivers flow beneath them. But We 
destroyed them for their sins, and established 
other civilizations after them.
7. Had We sent down upon you a book on pa￾per, and they had touched it with their hands, 
those who disbelieve would have said, “This 
is nothing but plain magic.”
8. And they say, “Why was an angel not sent 
down to him.” Had We sent down an angel, 
the matter would have been settled, and they 
would not have been reprieved.
9. Had We made him an angel, We would 
have made him a man, and confused them 
when they are already confused.
10. Messengers before you were ridiculed, but 
those who mocked them became besieged by 
what they ridiculed.
11. Say, “Travel the earth and observe the final 
fate of the deniers.”
12. Say, “To whom belongs what is in the heav￾ens and the earth?” Say, “To Allah.” He has 
inscribed for Himself mercy. He will gather 
you to the Day of Resurrection, in which 
there is no doubt. Those who lost their souls 
do not believe.
13. To Him belongs whatever rests in the night 
and the day. He is the Hearing, the Knowing.
14. Say, “Shall I take for myself a protector 
other than Allah, Originator of the heavens 
and the earth, and He feeds and is not fed?” 
Say, “I am instructed to be the first of those 
who submit.” And do not be among the idol￾aters.
15. Say, “I fear, should I defy my Lord, the pun￾ishment of a tremendous Day.”
16. Whoever is spared on that Day—He had 
mercy on him. That is the clear victory.
17. If Allah touches you with adversity, none 
can remove it except He. And if He touches 
you with good—He is Capable of everything.
18. He is the Supreme over His servants. He is 
the Wise, the Expert.
19. Say, “What thing is more solemn in testi￾mony?” Say, “Allah is Witness between you 
and me. This Quran was revealed to me, that 
I may warn you with it, and whomever it may 
reach. Do you indeed testify that there are 
other gods with Allah?” Say, “I myself do not 
testify.” Say, “He is but One God, and I am 
innocent of your idolatry.”
20. Those to whom We have given the Book 
recognize it as they recognize their own chil￾dren; but those who have lost their souls do 
not believe.
21. Who does greater wrong than someone 
who fabricates lies against Allah, or denies 
His revelations? The wrongdoers will not 
succeed.
22. On the Day when We gather them all to￾gether, then say to the idolaters, “Where are 
your idols, those you used to claim?”
23. Then their only argument will be to say, 
“By Allah, our Lord, we were not idolaters.”
24. Look how they lied to themselves. And 
what they invented deserted them.
25. Among them are those who listen to you; 
but We place covers over their hearts, to pre￾vent them from understanding it, and heavi￾ness in their ears. Even if they see every sign, 
they will not believe in it. Until, when they 
come to you, to argue with you, those who 
disbelieve will say, “These are nothing but 
myths of the ancients.”
26. They keep others from it, and avoid it 
themselves; but they ruin only their own 
souls, and they do not realize.
45
6. LIVESTOCK (al-An’am)
27. If only you could see, when they are made 
to stand before the Fire; they will say, “If only 
we could be sent back, and not reject the rev￾elations of our Lord, and be among the faith￾ful.”
28. What they used to conceal before will be￾come clear to them. And even if they were 
sent back, they would revert to what they 
were forbidden. They are liars.
29. And they say, “There is nothing but our life 
in this world, and we will not be resurrected.”
30. If only you could see, when they are sta￾tioned before their Lord. He will say, “Is this 
not real?” They will say, “Yes indeed, by our 
Lord.” He will say, “Then taste the torment 
for having disbelieved.”
31. Losers are those who deny the encounter 
with Allah. Then, when the Hour comes 
upon them suddenly, they will say, “Alas for 
us, how we have neglected it.” And they will 
carry their burdens on their backs—evil is 
what they carry.
32. The life of this world is nothing but game 
and distraction, but the Home of the Hereaf￾ter is better for those who are righteous. Do 
you not understand?
33. We know that what they say grieves you. It 
is not you they reject, but it is Allah's revela￾tions that the wicked deny.
34. Other messengers before you were re￾jected, but they endured rejection and perse￾cution until Our help came to them. There 
can be no change to Allah’s words. News of 
the Messengers has already reached you.
35. If you find their rejection hard to bear, then 
if you can, seek a tunnel into the earth, or a 
stairway into the heaven, and bring them a 
sign. Had Allah willed, He could have gath￾ered them to guidance. So do not be of the ig￾norant.
36. Only those who listen will respond. As for 
the dead, Allah will resurrect them; then to 
Him they will be returned.
37. And they say, “If only a sign could come 
down to him from his Lord.” Say, “Allah is 
Able to send down a sign, but most of them 
do not know.”
38. There is no animal on land, nor a bird fly￾ing with its wings, but are communities like 
you. We neglected nothing in the Scripture. 
Then to their Lord they will be gathered.
39. Those who reject Our revelations are deaf 
and dumb, in total darkness. Whomever Al￾lah wills, He leaves astray; and whomever He 
wills, He sets on a straight path.
40. Say, “Have you considered? if Allah's pun￾ishment came upon you, or the Hour over￾took you, would you call upon any other than 
Allah, if you are sincere?”
41. In fact, it is Him you will call upon; and if 
He wills, he will remove what you called Him 
for, and you will forget what you idolized.
42. We sent messengers to communities be￾fore you, and We afflicted them with suffer￾ing and hardship, that they may humble 
themselves.
43. If only, when Our calamity came upon 
them, they humbled themselves. But their 
hearts hardened, and Satan made their deeds 
appear good to them.
44. Then, when they disregarded what they 
were reminded of, We opened for them the 
gates of all things. Until, when they delighted 
in what they were given, We seized them sud￾denly; and at once, they were in despair.
45. Thus the last remnant of the people who 
did wrong was cut off. And praise be to Allah, 
Lord of the Worlds.
46. Say, “Have you considered? If Allah took 
away your hearing and your sight, and set a 
seal on your hearts, what god other than Al￾lah would restore them to you?” Note how 
We explain the revelations in various ways, 
yet they still turn away.
47. Say, “Have you considered? if Allah's pun￾ishment descended on you suddenly or grad￾ually, would any be destroyed except the 
wrongdoing people?”
48. We sent the messengers only as bearers of 
good news and as warners. Those who believe 
46
6. LIVESTOCK (al-An’am)
and reform have nothing to fear, nor shall 
they grieve.
49. But as for those who reject Our revelations, 
torment will afflict them because of their de￾fiance.
50. Say, “I do not say to you that I possess the 
treasuries of Allah, nor do I know the future, 
nor do I say to you that I am an angel. I only 
follow what is inspired to me.” Say, “Are the 
blind and the seeing alike? Do you not 
think?”
51. And warn with it those who fear to be gath￾ered before their Lord—they have no protec￾tor or intercessor apart from him—perhaps 
they will grow in piety.
52. And do not drive away those who call upon 
their Lord, morning and evening, seeking His 
attention. You are not accountable for them 
in any way, nor are they accountable for you 
in any way. If you drive them away, you 
would be one of the unjust.
53. Thus We try some of them by means of 
others, that they may say, “Are these the ones 
whom Allah has favored from among us?” Is 
Allah not aware of the appreciative?
54. When those who believe in Our revelations 
come to you, say, “Peace be upon you, your 
Lord has prescribed mercy for Himself. 
Whoever among you does wrong out of igno￾rance, and then repents afterwards and re￾forms—He is Forgiving and Merciful.”
55. Thus We explain the revelations, and ex￾pose the path of the unrighteous.
56. Say, “I am forbidden from worshiping 
those you pray to besides Allah.” Say, “I will 
not follow your desires; else I would be lost 
and not be of those guided.”
57. Say, “I stand on clear evidence from my 
Lord, and you have rejected Him. I do not 
possess what you seek me to hasten; the deci￾sion belongs solely to Allah. He states the 
truth, and He is the Best of Judges.”
58. Say, “If I possessed what you seek me to 
hasten, the matter between you and me 
would have been settled. Allah is well aware 
of the unjust.”
59. With Him are the keys of the unseen; none 
knows them except He. And He knows eve￾rything on land and in the sea. Not a leaf falls 
but He knows it; and there is not a single 
grain in the darkness of earth, nor is there an￾ything wet or dry, but is in a clear record.
60. It is He Who takes you by night, and He 
knows what you earn by day. Then He raises 
you up in it, until a fixed term is fulfilled. 
Then to Him is your return, then He will in￾form you of what you used to do.
61. He is the Conqueror over His servants, and 
He sends guardians over you, until, when 
death overtakes one of you, Our envoys take 
him away, and they never fail.
62. Then they are brought back to Allah, their 
True Master. Unquestionably, His is the 
judgment, and He is the Swiftest of reckon￾ers.
63. Say, “Who delivers you from the darkness 
of land and sea?” You call upon Him humbly 
and inwardly: “If He delivers us from this, 
We will surely be among the thankful.” 
64. Say, “It is Allah who delivers you from it, 
and from every disaster. Yet then you associ￾ate others with Him.”
65. Say, “He is Able to send upon you an afflic￾tion, from above you, or from under your 
feet. Or He can divide you into factions, and 
make you taste the violence of one another. 
Note how We explain the revelations, so that 
they may understand.”
66. But your people rejected it, though it is the 
truth. Say, “I am not responsible for you.”
67. For every happening is a finality, and you 
will surely know.
68. When you encounter those who gossip 
about Our revelations, turn away from them, 
until they engage in anothertopic. But should 
Satan make you forget, do not sit after the 
recollection with the wicked people.

69. The righteous are in no way accountable 
for them; it is only a reminder, that they may 
be careful.
70. So leave alone those who take their religion 
for play and pastime, and whom the worldly 
life has deceived. But remind with it, lest a 
soul becomes damned on account of what it 
has earned. It has no helper or intercessor be￾sides Allah. Even if it offers every equivalent, 
none will be accepted from it. These are the 
ones who are delivered to perdition by their 
actions. They will have a drink of scalding 
water, and a painful punishment, because 
they used to disbelieve.
71. Say, “Shall we invoke besides Allah some￾thing that can neither benefit us nor harm us,
and turn back on our heels after Allah has 
guided us; like someone seduced by the devils 
and confused on earth, who has friends call￾ing him to guidance: 'Come to us'?” Say, “The 
guidance of Allah is the guidance, and we are 
commanded to surrender to the Lord of the 
Universe.”
72. “And to perform the prayers, and to revere 
Him; it is to Him that you will be gathered.” 
73. It is He who created the heavens and the 
earth in truth. On the Day when He says: 
“Be,” it will be. His saying is the truth, and 
His is the sovereignty on the Day when the 
trumpet is blown. The Knower of secrets and 
declarations. He is the Wise, the Expert.
74. Abraham said to his father Azar, “Do you 
take idols for gods? I see that you and your 
people are in evident error.”
75. Thus We showed Abraham the empire of 
the heavens and the earth, that he might be 
one of those with certainty.
76. When the night fell over him, he saw a 
planet. He said, “This is my lord.” But when 
it set, he said, “I do not love those that set.”
77. Then, when he saw the moon rising, he 
said, “This is my lord.” But when it set, he 
said, “If my Lord does not guide me, I will be 
one of the erring people.”
78. Then, when he saw the sun rising, he said, 
“This is my lord, this is bigger.” But when it 
set, he said, “O my people, I am innocent of 
your idolatry. 
79. I have directed my attention towards Him 
Who created the heavens and the earth—a 
monotheist—and I am not of the idolaters.”
80. And his people argued with him. He said, 
“Do you argue with me about Allah, when He
has guided me? I do not fear what you asso￾ciate with Him, unless my Lord wills it. My 
Lord comprehends all things in knowledge. 
Will you not reconsider?
81. And why should I fear those you associate 
with Him, and you do not fear associating 
others with Allah for which He sent down to 
you no authority? Which side is more enti￾tled to security, if you are aware?”
82. Those who believe, and do not obscure 
their faith with wrongdoing—those will have 
security, and they are guided.
83. That was Our argument which We gave to 
Abraham against his people. We elevate by 
degrees whomever We will. Your Lord is 
Wise and Informed.
84. And We gave him Isaac and Jacob—each 
of them We guided. And We guided Noah 
previously; and from his descendants David, 
and Solomon, and Job, and Joseph, and Mo￾ses, and Aaron. Thus We reward the right￾eous.
85. And Zechariah, and John, and Jesus, and 
Elias—every one of them was of the upright.
86. And Ishmael, and Elijah, and Jonah, and 
Lot—We favored each one of them over all 
other people.
87. And of their ancestors, and their descend￾ants, and their siblings—We chose them, and 
guided them to a straight path.
88. Such is Allah’s guidance. He guides with it 
whomever He wills of His servants. Had they 
associated, their deeds would have gone in 
vain.
89. Those are they to whom We gave the Book, 
and wisdom, and prophethood. If these reject 
them, We have entrusted them to others who 
do not reject them.
48
6. LIVESTOCK (al-An’am)
90. Those are they whom Allah has guided, so 
follow their guidance. Say, “I ask of you no 
compensation for it; it is just a reminder for 
all mankind.”
91. They do not value Allah as He should be 
valued, when they say, “Allah did not reveal 
anything to any human being.” Say, “Who re￾vealed the Scripture which Moses brought—
a light and guidance for humanity?” You put 
it on scrolls, displaying them, yet concealing 
much. And you were taught what you did not 
know—neither you, nor your ancestors. Say, 
“Allah;” then leave them toying away in their 
speculation.
92. This too is a Scripture that We revealed—
blessed—verifying what preceded it, that you 
may warn the Mother of Cities and all around 
it. Those who believe in the Hereafter believe 
in it, and are dedicated to their prayers.
93. Who does greater wrong than someone 
who invents falsehood against Allah, or says,
“It was revealed to me,” when nothing was re￾vealed to him, or says, “I will reveal the like of 
what Allah revealed”? If only you could see 
the wrongdoers in the floods of death, as the 
angels with arms outstretched: “Give up your 
souls. Today you are being repaid with the 
torment of shame for having said about Allah 
other than the truth, and for being too proud 
to accept His revelations.”
94. “You have come to Us individually, just as 
We created you the first time, leaving behind 
you everything We gave you. We do not see 
with you your intercessors—those you 
claimed were your partners. The link be￾tween you is cut, and what you had asserted 
has failed you.”
95. It is Allah Who splits the grain and the 
seed. He brings the living from the dead, and 
He brings the dead from the living. Such is 
Allah. So how could you deviate?
96. It is He Who breaks the dawn. And He 
made the night for rest, and the sun and the 
moon for calculation. Such is the disposition 
of the Almighty, the All-Knowing.
97. And it is He Who created the stars for you, 
that you may be guided by them in the dark￾ness of land and sea. We thus explain the rev￾elations for people who know.
98. And it is He who produced you from a sin￾gle person, then a repository, then a deposi￾tory. We have detailed the revelations for 
people who understand.
99. And it is He who sends down water from 
the sky. With it We produce vegetation of all 
kinds, from which We bring greenery, from 
which We produce grains in clusters. And 
palm-trees with hanging clusters, and vine￾yards, and olives, and pomegranates—similar 
and dissimilar. Watch their fruits as they 
grow and ripen. Surely in this are signs for 
people who believe. 
100. Yet they attributed to Allah partners—the 
sprites—although He created them. And they 
invented for Him sons and daughters, with￾out any knowledge. Glory be to Him. He is 
exalted, beyond what they describe.
101. Originator of the heavens and the earth—
how can He have a son when He never had a 
companion? He created all things, and He 
has knowledge of all things. 
102. Such is Allah, your Lord. There is no god 
except He, the Creator of all things; so wor￾ship Him. He is responsible for everything.
103. No vision can grasp Him, but His grasp is 
over all vision. He is the Subtle, the Expert.
104. “Insights have come to you from your 
Lord. Whoever sees, it is to the benefit of his 
soul; and whoever remains blind, it is to its 
detriment. I am not a guardian over you.”
105. We thus diversify the revelations, lest they 
say, “You have studied,” and to clarify them 
for people who know.
106. Follow what was revealed to you from 
your Lord. There is no god but He. And turn 
away from the polytheists.
107. Had Allah willed, they would not have 
practiced idolatry. We did not appoint you as 
a guardian over them, and you are not a man￾ager over them.
49
6. LIVESTOCK (al-An’am)
108. Do not insult those they call upon besides 
Allah, lest they insult Allah out of hostility 
and ignorance. We made attractive to every 
community their deeds. Then to their Lord is 
their return, and He will inform them of what 
they used to do.
109. They swear by Allah, with their most sol￾emn oaths, that if a miracle were to come to 
them, they would believe in it. Say, “The mir￾acles are only with Allah.” But how do you 
know? Even if it did come, they still would 
not believe.
110. And We turn away their hearts and their 
visions, as they refused to believe in it the first 
time, and We leave them blundering in their 
rebellion.
111. Even if We sent down the angels to them, 
and the dead spoke to them, and We gathered 
all things before them, they still would not 
believe, unless Allah wills; but most of them 
are ignorant.
112. Likewise, We have assigned for every 
prophet an enemy—human and jinn devils—
inspiring one another with fancy words in or￾der to deceive. But had your Lord willed, they 
would not have done it. So leave them to their 
fabrications.
113. So that the hearts of those who do not be￾lieve in the Hereafter may incline to it, and be 
content with it, and that they may perpetrate 
whatever they perpetrate.
114. “Shall I seek a judge other than Allah, 
when He is the One who revealed to you the 
Book, explained in detail?” Those to whom 
We gave the Book know that it is the truth re￾vealed from your Lord. So do not be of those 
who doubt.
115. The Word of your Lord has been com￾pleted, in truth and justice. There is no 
changing to His words. He is the Hearer, the 
Knower.
116. If you were to obey most of those on earth, 
they would divert you from Allah’s path. 
They follow nothing but assumptions, and 
they only conjecture.
117. Your Lord knows best who strays from His 
path, and He knows best the guided ones.
118. So eat of that over which the Name of Al￾lah was pronounced, if you indeed believe in 
His revelations.
119. And why should you not eat of that over 
which the Name of Allah is pronounced, 
when He has detailed for you what is prohib￾ited for you, unless you are compelled by ne￾cessity? Many lead astray with their opinions, 
through lack of knowledge. Your Lord knows 
best the transgressors.
120. So abandon sin, outward and inward. 
Those who commit sins will be repaid for 
what they used to perpetrate.
121. And do not eat from that over which the 
Name of Allah was not pronounced, for it is 
abomination. The devils inspire their follow￾ers to argue with you; but if you obey them, 
you would be polytheists.
122. Is he who was dead, then We gave him life, 
and made for him a light by which he walks 
among the people, like he who is in total 
darkness, and cannot get out of it? Thus the 
doings of disbelievers are made to appear 
good to them.
123. And thus We set up in every city its lead￾ing wicked sinners, to conspire in it, but they 
conspire only against themselves, and they do 
not realize it.
124. When a sign comes to them, they say, “We 
will not believe unless we are given the like of 
what was given to Allah’s messengers.” Allah 
knows best where to place His message. Hu￾miliation from Allah and severe torment will 
afflict the criminals for their scheming.
125. Whomever Allah desires to guide, He 
spreads open his heart to Islam; and whom￾ever He desires to misguide, He makes his 
heart narrow, constricted, as though he were 
climbing up the sky. Allah thus lays defile￾ment upon those who do not believe.
126. This is the straight path of your Lord. We 
have explained the revelations in detail for 
people who recollect.
50
6. LIVESTOCK (al-An’am)
127. For them is the Home of Peace with their 
Lord, and He is their Master—because of 
what they used to do.
128. On the Day when He gathers them all to￾gether: “O assembly of jinn, you have ex￾ploited multitudes of humans.” Their adher￾ents among mankind will say, “Our Lord, we 
have profited from one another, but we have 
reached the term that you have assigned for 
us.” He will say, “The Fire is your dwelling, 
wherein you will remain, except as Allah 
wills. Your Lord is Wise and Informed.
129. Thus We make some of the wrongdoers 
befriend one another, because of what they 
used to do.
130. “O assembly of jinn and humans, did there 
not come to you messengers from among 
you, relating to you My revelations, and 
warning you of the meeting of this Day of 
yours?” They will say, “We testify against 
ourselves.” The life of the world seduced 
them. They will testify against themselves 
that they were disbelievers.
131. That is because your Lord would not de￾stroy towns for injustice while their inhabit￾ants are unaware.
132. They all have ranks according to what they 
did; and your Lord is not unaware of what 
they do.
133. Your Lord is the Rich Beyond Need, the 
Possessor of Mercy. If He wills, He can do 
away with you, and substitute whomever He 
wills in your place, just as He produced you 
from the descendants of another people.
134. What you are promised is coming, and 
you cannot thwart it.
135. Say, “O my people! Work according to 
your ability, and so will I.” You will come to 
know to whom will belong the sequel of the 
abode.” The wrongdoers will not prevail.
136. And they set aside for Allah a share of the 
crops and the livestock He created, and they 
say, “This is for Allah,” according to their 
claim, “and this is for our idols.” But the share 
of their idols does not reach Allah, yet the 
share of Allah reaches their idols. Evil is their 
judgment.
137. Likewise, their idols entice many idolaters 
to kill their children, in order to lead them to 
their ruin, and confuse them in their religion. 
Had Allah willed, they would not have done
it; so leave them to their fraud.
138. And they say, “These animals and crops 
are restricted; none may eat them except 
those we permit,” by their claims, and ani￾mals whose backs are forbidden, and animals 
over which they do not pronounce the name 
of Allah—fabricating lies against Him. He 
will repay them for what they used to invent.
139. And they say, “What lies in the wombs of 
these animals is exclusively for our males, 
and prohibited to our wives.” But if it is still￾born, they can share in it. He will surely pun￾ish them for their allegations. He is Wise and 
Knowing.
140. Lost are those who kill their children fool￾ishly, with no basis in knowledge, and forbid 
what Allah has provided for them—innova￾tions about Allah. They have gone astray. 
They are not guided.
141. It is He who produces gardens, both culti￾vated and wild, and date-palms, and crops of 
diverse tastes, and olives and pomegranates, 
similar and dissimilar. Eat of its fruit when it 
yields, and give its due on the day of its har￾vest, and do not waste. He does not love the 
wasteful.
142. Among the livestock are some for trans￾portation, and some for clothing. Eat of what 
Allah has provided for you, and do not follow 
the footsteps of Satan. He is to you an out￾right enemy.
143. Eight pairs: two of the sheep, and two of 
the goats. Say, “Did He forbid the two males, 
or the two females, or what the wombs of the 
two females contain? Inform me with 
knowledge, if you are truthful.”
144. And two of the camels, and two of the cat￾tle. Say, “Did He forbid the two males, or the 
two females, or what the wombs of the two 
51
6. LIVESTOCK (al-An’am)
females contain? Were you present when Al￾lah enjoined this upon you?” Who does 
greater wrong than he who invents lies and 
attributes them to Allah, in order to mislead 
people without knowledge? Allah does not 
guide the wicked people.
145. Say, “In what was revealed to me, I find 
nothing forbidden to a consumer who eats it, 
except carrion, or spilled blood, or the flesh 
of swine—because it is impure—or a sinful 
offering dedicated to other than Allah. But if 
someone is compelled by necessity, without 
being deliberate or malicious—your Lord is 
Forgiving and Merciful.
146. For the Jews We forbade everything with 
claws. As of cattle and sheep: We forbade 
them their fat, except what adheres to their 
backs, or the entrails, or what is mixed with 
bone. This is how We penalized them for 
their inequity. We are indeed truthful.
147. If they accuse you of lying, say, “Your Lord 
is Possessor of infinite mercy, but His wrath 
cannot be averted from the guilty people.”
148. The polytheists will say, “Had Allah willed, 
we would not have practiced idolatry, nor 
would have our forefathers, nor would we 
have prohibited anything.” Likewise those 
before them lied, until they tasted Our might. 
Say, “Do you have any knowledge that you 
can produce for us? You follow nothing but 
conjecture, and you only guess.”
149. Say, “To Allah belongs the conclusive ar￾gument. Had He willed, He would have 
guided you all.”
150. Say, “Produce your witnesses who would 
testify that Allah has prohibited this.” If they 
testify, do not testify with them. And do not 
follow the whims of those who deny Our rev￾elation, and those who do not believe in the 
Hereafter, and those who equate others with 
their Lord.
151. Say, “Come, let me tell you what your Lord 
has forbidden you: that you associate nothing 
with Him; that you honor your parents; that 
you do not kill your children because of pov￾erty—We provide for you and for them; that 
you do not come near indecencies, whether 
outward or inward; and that you do not kill 
the soul which Allah has sanctified—except 
in the course of justice. All this He has en￾joined upon you, so that you may under￾stand.”
152. And do not come near the property of the 
orphan, except with the best intentions, until 
he reaches maturity. And give full weight and 
full measure, equitably. We do not burden 
any soul beyond its capacity. And when you 
speak, be fair, even if it concerns a close rela￾tive. And fulfill your covenant with Allah. All 
this He has enjoined upon you, so that you 
may take heed.
153. This is My path, straight, so follow it. And 
do not follow the other paths, lest they divert 
you from His path. All this He has enjoined 
upon you, that you may refrain from wrong￾doing.
154. Then We gave Moses the Scripture, per￾fect for the righteous, and explaining every￾thing clearly, and a beacon, and mercy, that 
they may believe in the encounter with their 
Lord.
155. This too is a blessed Scripture that We re￾vealed; so follow it, and be righteous, that you 
may receive mercy. 
156. Lest you say, “The Scripture was revealed 
to two parties before us, and we were una￾ware of their teachings.”
157. Or lest you say, “Had the Scripture been 
revealed to us, we would have been better 
guided than they.” Clarification has come to 
you from your Lord, and guidance, and 
mercy. Who then does greater wrong than he 
who gives the lie to Allah's messages, and 
turns away from them? We will repay those 
who turn away from Our messages with the 
worst kind of punishment, because of their 
turning away.
158. Are they waiting for anything but for the 
angels to come to them, or for your Lord to 
arrive, or for some of your Lord’s signs to 
come? On the Day when some of your Lord’s 
signs come, no soul will benefit from its faith 
unless it had believed previously, or had 
52
7. THE ELEVATIONS (al-A’raf)
earned goodness through its faith. Say, “Wait, 
we too are waiting.”
159. As for those who divided their religion 
and became sects—you have nothing to do 
with them. Their case rests with Allah; then 
He will inform them of what they used to do.
160. Whoever comes up with a good deed will 
have ten times its like; and whoever comes up 
with an evil deed will be repaid only with its 
equivalent—they will not be wronged.
161. Say, “My Lord has guided me to a straight 
path, an upright religion, the creed of Abra￾ham the Monotheist, who was not a polythe￾ist.”
162. Say, “My prayer and my worship, and my 
life and my death, are devoted to Allah, the 
Lord of the Worlds.
163. No associate has He. Thus I am com￾manded, and I am the first of those who sub￾mit.
164. Say, “Am I to seek a Lord other than Allah, 
when He is the Lord of all things?” No soul 
gets except what it is due, and no soul bears 
the burdens of another. Then to your Lord is 
your return, then He will inform you regard￾ing your disputes.
165. It is He who made you successors on the 
earth, and raised some of you in ranks over 
others, in order to test you through what He 
has given you. Your Lord is Quick in retribu￾tion, and He is Forgiving and Merciful.
7. THE ELEVATIONS
(al-A’raf)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Alif, Lam, Meem, Saad.
2. A Scripture was revealed to you, so let there 
be no anxiety in your heart because of it. You 
are to warn with it—and a reminder for the 
believers.
3. Follow what is revealed to you from your 
Lord, and do not follow other masters beside 
Him. Little you recollect.
4. How many a town have We destroyed? Our 
might came upon them by night, or while 
they were napping.
5. When Our might came upon them, their 
only cry was, “We were indeed wrongdoers.”
6. We will question those to whom messen￾gers were sent, and We will question the mes￾sengers.
7. We will narrate to them with knowledge, 
for We were never absent.
8. The scales on that Day will be just. Those 
whose weights are heavy—it is they who are 
the successful.
9. But as for those whose weights are light—it 
is they who have lost their souls, because they 
used to mistreat Our revelations.
10. We have established you firmly on earth, 
and made for you in it livelihood—but rarely 
do you give thanks.
11. We created you, then We shaped you, then 
We said to the angels, “Bow down before 
Adam;” so they bowed down, except for Sa￾tan; he was not of those who bowed down.
12. He said, “What prevented you from bow￾ing down when I have commanded you?” He 
said, “I am better than he; You created me 
from fire, and You created him from mud.”
13. He said, “Get down from it! It is not for you 
to act arrogantly in it. Get out! You are one of 
the lowly!”
14. He said, “Give me respite, until the Day 
they are resurrected.”
15. He said, “You are of those given respite.”
16. He said, “Because you have lured me, I will 
waylay them on Your straight path.
17. Then I will come at them from before 
them, and from behind them, and from their 
right, and from their left; and you will not 
find most of them appreciative.”
18. He said, “Get out of it, despised and van￾quished. Whoever among them follows 
you—I will fill up Hell with you all.
19. And you, Adam, inhabit the Garden, you 
and your wife, and eat whatever you wish; but 
53
7. THE ELEVATIONS (al-A’raf)
do not approach this tree, lest you become 
sinners.”
20. But Satan whispered to them, to reveal to 
them their nakedness, which was invisible to 
them. He said, “Your Lord has only forbid￾den you this tree, lest you become angels, or 
become immortals.”
21. And he swore to them, “I am a sincere ad￾visor to you.”
22. So he lured them with deceit. And when 
they tasted the tree, their nakedness became 
evident to them, and they began covering 
themselves with the leaves of the Garden. 
And their Lord called out to them, “Did I not 
forbid you from this tree, and say to you that 
Satan is a sworn enemy to you?”
23. They said, “Our Lord, we have done wrong 
to ourselves. Unless You forgive us, and have 
mercy on us, we will be among the losers.”
24. He said, “Fall, some of you enemies to one 
another. On earth you will have residence 
and livelihood for a while.”
25. He said, “In it you will live, and in it you 
will die, and from it you will be brought out.”
26. O children of Adam! We have provided 
you with clothing to cover your bodies, and 
for luxury. But the clothing of piety—that is 
best. These are some of Allah’s revelations, so 
that they may take heed.
27. O Children of Adam! Do not let Satan se￾duce you, as he drove your parents out of the 
Garden, stripping them of their garments, to 
show them their nakedness. He sees you, him 
and his clan, from where you cannot see 
them. We have made the devils friends of 
those who do not believe.
28. And when they commit an indecency, they 
say, “We found our parents doing this, and 
Allah has commanded us to do it.” Say, “Al￾lah does not command indecencies. Are you 
attributing to Allah what you do not know?”
29. Say, “My Lord commands justice, and to 
stand devoted at every place of worship. So 
call upon Him, and dedicate your faith to 
Him alone. Just as He originated you, so you 
will return.”
30. Some He has guided, and some have de￾served misguidance. They have adopted the 
devils for patrons rather than Allah, and they 
assume that they are guided.
31. O Children of Adam! Dress properly at 
every place of worship, and eat and drink, but 
do not be excessive. He does not love the ex￾cessive.
32. Say, “Who forbade Allah’s finery which He 
has produced for His servants, and the de￾lights of livelihood?” Say, “They are for those 
who believe, in this present world, but exclu￾sively theirs on the Day of Resurrection.” We 
thus detail the revelations for people who 
know.
33. Say, “My Lord has forbidden immorali￾ties—both open and secret—and sin, and un￾justified aggression, and that you associate 
with Allah anything for which He revealed no 
sanction, and that you say about Allah what 
you do not know.”
34. For every nation is an appointed time. 
When their time has come, they cannot delay 
it by one hour, nor can they advance it.
35. O Children of Adam! When messengers 
from among you come to you, relating to you 
My revelations—whoever practices piety and 
reforms—upon them shall be no fear, nor 
shall they grieve.
36. But as for those who reject Our revelations, 
and are too proud to accept them—these are 
the inmates of the Fire, where they will re￾main forever.
37. Who does greater wrong than he who in￾vents lies about Allah, or denies His revela￾tions? These—their share of the decree will 
reach them. Until, when Our envoys come to 
them, to take their souls away, they will say, 
“Where are they whom you used to pray to 
besides Allah?” They will say, “They have 
abandoned us,” and they will testify against 
themselves that they were faithless.
38. He will say, “Join the crowds of jinn and 
humans who have gone into the Fire before 
54
7. THE ELEVATIONS (al-A’raf)
you.” Every time a crowd enters, it will curse 
its sister-crowd. Until, when they are all in it, 
the last of them will say to the first of them, 
“Our Lord, these are the ones who misled us, 
so inflict on them a double punishment in the 
Fire.” He will say, “Each will have a double, 
but you do not know.”
39. The first of them will say to the last of them, 
“You have no advantage over us, so taste the 
torment for what you used to earn.”
40. Those who reject Our revelations and are 
too arrogant to uphold them—the doors of 
Heaven will not be opened for them, nor will 
they enter Paradise, until the camel passes 
through the eye of the needle. Thus We repay 
the guilty.
41. For them is a couch of hell, and above them 
are sheets of fire. Thus We repay the wrong￾doers.
42. As for those who believe and do righteous 
works—We never burden any soul beyond its 
capacity—these are the inhabitants of the 
Garden; abiding therein eternally.
43. We will remove whatever rancor is in their 
hearts. Rivers will flow beneath them. And 
they will say, “Praise be to Allah, who has 
guided us to this. Had Allah not guided us, 
we would never be guided. The messengers of 
our Lord did come with the truth.” And it will 
be proclaimed to them, “This is the Garden 
you are made to inherit, on account of what 
you used to do.”
44. And the inhabitants of the Garden will call 
out to the inmates of the Fire, “We found 
what our Lord promised us to be true; did 
you find what your Lord promised you to be 
true?” They will say, “Yes.” Thereupon a 
caller will announce in their midst, “The 
curse of Allah is upon the wrongdoers.”
45. “Those who hinder from the path of Allah, 
and seek to distort it, and who deny the Here￾after.”
46. And between them is a partition, and on 
the Elevations are men who recognize every￾one by their features. They will call to the in￾habitants of the Garden, “Peace be upon 
you.” They have not entered it, but they are 
hoping.
47. And when their eyes are directed towards 
the inmates of the Fire, they will say, “Our 
Lord, do not place us among the wrongdoing 
people.”
48. And the dwellers of the Elevations will call 
to men they recognize by their features, say￾ing, “Your hoardings did not avail you, nor 
did your arrogance.”
49. “Are these the ones you swore Allah will 
not touch with mercy?” “Enter the Garden; 
you have nothing to fear, and you will not 
grieve.”
50. The inmates of the Fire will call on the in￾habitants of the Garden, “Pour some water 
over us, or some of what Allah has provided 
for you.” They will say, “Allah has forbidden 
them for the disbelievers.”
51. Those who took their religion lightly, and 
in jest, and whom the worldly life deceived. 
Today We will ignore them, as they ignored 
the meeting on this Day of theirs, and they 
used to deny Our revelations.
52. We have given them a Scripture, which We 
detailed with knowledge—guidance and 
mercy for people who believe.
53. Are they waiting for anything but its fulfill￾ment? The Day its fulfillment comes true, 
those who disregarded it before will say, “The 
messengers of our Lord did come with the 
truth. Have we any intercessors to intercede 
for us? Or, could we be sent back, to behave 
differently from the way we behaved before?” 
They ruined their souls, and what they used 
to invent has failed them.
54. Your Lord is Allah; He who created the 
heavens and the earth in six days, then estab￾lished Himself on the Throne. The night 
overtakes the day, as it pursues it persistently; 
and the sun, and the moon, and the stars are 
subservient by His command. His is the cre￾ation, and His is the command. Blessed is Al￾lah, Lord of all beings.
55. Call upon your Lord humbly and privately. 
He does not love the aggressors.
55
7. THE ELEVATIONS (al-A’raf)
56. And do not corrupt on earth after its refor￾mation, and pray to Him with fear and hope. 
Allah’s mercy is close to the doers of good.
57. It is He who sends the wind ahead of His 
mercy. Then, when they have gathered up 
heavy clouds, We drive them to a dead land, 
where We make water come down, and with 
it We bring out all kinds of fruits. Thus We 
bring out the dead—perhaps you will reflect.
58. As for the good land, it yields its produce 
by the leave of its Lord. But as for the bad, it 
produces nothing but hardship and misery. 
Thus We explain the revelations in various 
ways for people who are thankful.
59. We sent Noah to his people. He said, “O 
my people! Worship Allah; you have no god 
other than Him. I fear for you the punish￾ment of a tremendous Day.”
60. The dignitaries among his people said, 
“We see that you are in obvious error.”
61. He said, “O my people, I am not in error, 
but I am a messenger from the Lord of the
Worlds.”
62. “I deliver to you the messages of my Lord, 
and I advise you, and I know from Allah what 
you do not know.”
63. “Do you wonder that a reminder has come 
to you from your Lord, through a man from 
among you, to warn you, and to lead you to 
righteousness, so that you may attain 
mercy?”
64. But they called him a liar. So We saved him 
and those with him in the Ark, and We 
drowned those who rejected Our revelations. 
They were blind people.
65. And to Aad, their brother Hud. He said, “O 
my people! Worship Allah; you have no god 
other than Him. Will you not take heed?”
66. The elite of his people who disbelieved 
said, “We see foolishness in you, and we think 
that you are a liar.”
67. He said, “O my people! There is no foolish￾ness in me, but I am a messenger from the 
Lord of the Worlds.
68. “I convey to you the messages of my Lord, 
and I am a trustworthy adviser to you.”
69. “Are you surprised that a reminder has 
come to you from your Lord, through a man 
from among you, to warn you? Remember 
how He made you successors after the people 
of Noah, and increased you greatly in stature. 
And remember Allah’s blessings, so that you 
may prosper.”
70. They said, “Did you come to us to make us 
worship Allah alone, and abandon what our 
ancestors used to worship? Then bring us 
what you threaten us with, if you are truth￾ful.”
71. He said, “Condemnation and wrath have 
befallen you from your Lord. Are you arguing 
with me over names, which you and your an￾cestors invented, for which Allah sent down 
no authority? Just wait; I am waiting with 
you.” 
72. So We saved him and those with him, by 
mercy from Us, and We cut off the roots of 
those who rejected Our revelations and were 
not believers.
73. And to Thamood, their brother Saleh. He 
said, “O my people! Worship Allah; you have
no god other than Him. Clarification has 
come to you from your Lord. This she-camel 
of Allah is a sign for you. So leave her to graze 
on Allah’s earth, and do her no harm, lest a 
painful penalty seizes you.”
74. “And remember how He made you succes￾sors after Aad, and settled you in the land. 
You make for yourselves mansions on its 
plains, and carve out dwellings in the moun￾tains. So remember Allah’s benefits, and do 
not roam the earth corruptingly.”
75. The elite of his people, who were arrogant, 
said to the common people who had believed, 
“Do you know that Saleh is sent from his 
Lord?” They said, “We are believers in what 
he was sent with.”
76. Those who were arrogant said, “We reject 
what you believe in.”
77. So they hamstrung the she-camel, and de￾fied the command of their Lord, and said, “O 
56
7. THE ELEVATIONS (al-A’raf)
Saleh, bring upon us what you threaten us 
with, if you are one of the messengers.”
78. Whereupon the quake overtook them, and 
they became lifeless bodies in their homes. 
79. Then he turned away from them, and said, 
“O my people, I have delivered to you the 
message of my Lord, and I have advised you, 
but you do not like those who give advice.”
80. And Lot, when he said to his people, “Do 
you commit lewdness no people anywhere 
have ever committed before you?”
81. “You lust after men rather than women. 
You are an excessive people.”
82. And his people's only answer was to say, 
“Expel them from your town; they are purist 
people.”
83. But We saved him and his family, except 
for his wife; she was of those who lagged be￾hind.
84. And We rained down on them a rain; note 
the consequences for the sinners.
85. And to Median, their brother Shuaib. He 
said, “O my people, worship Allah; you have 
no god other than Him. A clear proof has 
come to you from your Lord. Give full meas￾ure and weight, and do not cheat people out 
of their rights, and do not corrupt the land 
once it has been set right. This is better for 
you, if you are believers.”
86. “And do not lurk on every path, making 
threats and turning away from the path of Al￾lah those who believe in Him, seeking to dis￾tort it. And remember how you were few, and 
how He made you numerous. So note the 
consequences for the corrupters.”
87. “Since some of you believed in what I was 
sent with, and some did not believe, be pa￾tient until Allah judges between us; for He is 
the Best of Judges.”
88. The arrogant elite among his people said, 
“O Shuaib, We will evict you from our town, 
along with those who believe with you, unless 
you return to our religion.” He said, “Even if 
we are unwilling?”
89. “We would be fabricating falsehood 
against Allah, if we were to return to your re￾ligion, after Allah has saved us from it. It is 
not for us to return to it, unless Allah, our 
Lord, wills. Our Lord embraces all things in 
knowledge. In Allah we place our trust. Our 
Lord, decide between us and our people in 
truth, for You are the Best of Deciders.”
90. The elite of his people who disbelieved 
said, “If you follow Shuaib, you will be los￾ers.”
91. Thereupon, the quake struck them; and 
they became lifeless bodies in their homes.
92. Those who rejected Shuaib—as if they 
never prospered therein. Those who rejected 
Shuaib—it was they who were the losers.
93. So he turned away from them, and said, “O 
my people, I have delivered to you the mes￾sages of my Lord, and I have advised you, so 
why should I grieve over a disbelieving peo￾ple?”
94. We did not send any prophet to any town 
but We afflicted its people with misery and 
adversity, so that they may humble them￾selves.
95. Then We substituted prosperity in place of 
hardship. Until they increased in number, 
and said, “Adversity and prosperity has 
touched our ancestors.” Then We seized 
them suddenly, while they were unaware.
96. Had the people of the towns believed and 
turned righteous, We would have opened for 
them the blessings of the heaven and the 
earth; but they rejected the truth, so We 
seized them by what they were doing.
97. Do the people of the towns feel secure that 
Our might will not come upon them by night, 
while they sleep?
98. Do the people of the towns feel secure that 
Our might will not come upon them by day, 
while they play?
99. Do they feel safe from Allah’s plan? None 
feel safe from Allah’s plan except the losing 
people.
57
7. THE ELEVATIONS (al-A’raf)
100. Is it not guidance for those who inherit the 
land after its inhabitants, that if We willed, 
We could strike them for their sins? And seal 
up their hearts, so that they would not hear?
101. These towns—We narrate to you some of 
their tales. Their messengers came to them 
with the clear signs, but they would not be￾lieve in what they had rejected previously. 
Thus Allah seals the hearts of the disbelievers.
102. We found most of them untrue to their 
covenants; We found most of them corrupt.
103. Then, after them, We sent Moses with Our 
miracles to Pharaoh and his establishment, 
but they denounced them. So consider the 
end of the evildoers.
104. Moses said, “O Pharaoh, I am a messenger 
from the Lord of the Worlds.”
105. “It is only proper that I should not say 
about Allah anything other than the truth. I 
have come to you with clear evidence from 
your Lord, so let the Children of Israel go 
with me.”
106. He said, “If you brought a miracle, then 
present it, if you are truthful.”
107. So he threw his staff, and it was an appar￾ent serpent.
108. And He pulled out his hand, and it was 
white to the onlookers.
109. The notables among Pharaoh’s people 
said, “This is really a skilled magician.”
110. “He wants to evict you from your land, so 
what do you recommend?”
111. They said, “Put him off, and his brother, 
and send heralds to the cities.”
112. “And let them bring you every skillful ma￾gician.”
113. The magicians came to Pharaoh, and said, 
“Surely there is a reward for us, if we are the 
victors.”
114. He said, “Yes, and you will be among my 
favorites.”
115. They said, “O Moses! Either you throw, or 
we are the ones to throw.”
116. He said, “You throw!” And when they 
threw, they beguiled the eyes of the people, 
and intimidated them, and produced a 
mighty magic.
117. And We inspired Moses: “Throw your 
staff.” And at once, it swallowed what they 
were faking.
118. So the truth came to pass, and what they 
were producing came to nothing.
119. There they were defeated, and utterly re￾duced.
120. And the magicians fell to their knees.
121. They said, “We have believed in the Lord 
of the Worlds.”
122. “The Lord of Moses and Aaron.”
123. Pharaoh said, “Did you believe in Him be￾fore I have given you permission? This is 
surely a conspiracy you schemed in the city, 
in order to expel its people from it. You will 
surely know.”
124. “I will cut off your hands and your feet on 
opposite sides; then I will crucify you all.”
125. They said, “It is to our Lord that we will 
return.”
126. “You are taking vengeance on us only be￾cause we have believed in the signs of our 
Lord when they have come to us.” “Our Lord! 
Pour out patience upon us, and receive our 
souls in submission.”
127. The chiefs of Pharaoh's people said, “Will 
you let Moses and his people cause trouble in 
the land, and forsake you and your gods?” He 
said, “We will kill their sons, and spare their 
women. We have absolute power over them.”
128. Moses said to his people, “Seek help in Al￾lah, and be patient. The earth belongs to Al￾lah. He gives it in inheritance to whomever 
He wills of His servants, and the future be￾longs to the righteous.”
129. They said, “We were persecuted before 
you came to us, and after you came to us.” He 
said, “Perhaps your Lord will destroy your 
enemy, and make you successors in the land; 
then He will see how you behave.”
58
7. THE ELEVATIONS (al-A’raf)
130. And We afflicted the people of Pharaoh 
with barren years, and with shortage of crops, 
that they may take heed.
131. When something good came their way, 
they said, “This is ours.” And when some￾thing bad happened to them, they ascribed 
the evil omen to Moses and those with him. 
In fact, their omen is with Allah, but most of 
them do not know.
132. And they said, “No matter what sign you 
bring us, to bewitch us with, we will not be￾lieve in you.”
133. So We let loose upon them the flood, and 
the locusts, and the lice, and the frogs, and 
blood—all explicit signs—but they were too 
arrogant. They were a sinful people.
134. Whenever a plague befell them, they 
would say, “O Moses, pray to your Lord for 
us, according to the covenant He made with 
you. If you lift the plague from us, we will be￾lieve in you, and let the Children of Israel go 
with you.”
135. But when We lifted the plague from them, 
for a term they were to fulfill, they broke their 
promise.
136. So We took vengeance on them, and 
drowned them in the sea—because they re￾jected Our signs, and paid no heed to them.
137. And We made the oppressed people in￾herit the eastern and western parts of the 
land, which We had blessed. Thus the fair 
promise of your Lord to the Children of Israel 
was fulfilled, because of their endurance. And 
We destroyed what Pharaoh and his people 
had built, and what they had harvested.
138. And We delivered the Children of Israel 
across the sea. And when they came upon a 
people who were devoted to some statues of 
theirs, they said, “O Moses, make for us a god, 
as they have gods.” He said, “You are truly an 
ignorant people.”
139. “What these people are concerned with is 
perdition, and their deeds are based on false￾hoods.”
140. He said, “Shall I seek for you a god other 
than Allah, when He has favored you over all 
other people?”
141. Remember how We saved you from Phar￾aoh’s people, who subjected you to the worst 
of sufferings—killing your sons and sparing 
your women. In that was a tremendous trial 
from your Lord.
142. And We appointed to Moses thirty nights, 
and completed them with ten; and thus the 
time appointed by his Lord was forty nights. 
And Moses said to his brother Aaron: “Take 
my place among my people, and be upright, 
and do not follow the way of the mischief￾makers.”
143. And when Moses came to Our appoint￾ment, and his Lord spoke to him, he said, 
“My Lord, allow me to look and see You.” He 
said, “You will not see Me, but look at the 
mountain; if it stays in its place, you will see 
Me.” But when his Lord manifested Himself 
to the mountain, He turned it into dust, and 
Moses fell down unconscious. Then, when he 
recovered, he said, “Glory be to you, I repent 
to you, and I am the first of the believers.”
144. He said, “O Moses, I have chosen you over 
all people for My messages and for My 
Words. So take what I have given you, and be 
one of the thankful.”
145. And We inscribed for him in the Tablets 
all kinds of enlightenments, and decisive ex￾planation of all things. “Hold fast to them, 
and exhort your people to adopt the best of 
them. I will show you the fate of the sinners.”
146. I will turn away from My revelations those 
who behave proudly on earth without justifi￾cation. Even if they see every sign, they will 
not believe in it; and if they see the path of 
rectitude, they will not adopt it for a path; and 
if they see the path of error, they will adopt it 
for a path. That is because they denied Our 
revelations, and paid no attention to them.
147. Those who deny Our revelations and the 
meeting of the Hereafter—their deeds will 
come to nothing. Will they be repaid except 
according to what they used to do?
59
7. THE ELEVATIONS (al-A’raf)
148. In his absence, the people of Moses 
adopted a calf made from their ornaments—
a body which lowed. Did they not see that it 
could not speak to them, nor guide them in 
any way? They took it for worship. They were 
in the wrong.
149. Then, when they regretted, and realized 
that they had erred, they said, “Unless our 
Lord extends His mercy to us, and forgives 
us, we will be among the losers.”
150. And when Moses returned to his people, 
angry and disappointed, he said, “What an 
awful thing you did in my absence. Did you
forsake the commandments of your Lord so 
hastily?” And he threw down the tablets; and 
he took hold of his brother’s head, dragging 
him towards himself. He said, “Son of my 
mother, the people have overpowered me, 
and were about to kill me; so do not allow the 
enemies to gloat over me, and do not count 
me among the unjust people.”
151. He said, “My Lord, forgive me and my 
brother, and admit us into Your mercy; for 
you are the Most Merciful of the merciful.” 
152. Those who idolized the calf have incurred 
wrath from their Lord, and humiliation in 
this life. We thus requite the innovators.
153. As for those who commit sins, and then 
repent afterwards and believe—your Lord, 
thereafter, is Forgiving and Merciful.
154. When the anger abated in Moses, he took 
up the tablets. In their transcript is guidance 
and mercy for those in awe of their Lord.
155. And Moses chose from his people seventy 
men for Our appointment. When the tremor 
shook them, he said, “My Lord, had You 
willed, You could have destroyed them be￾fore, and me too. Will you destroy us for what 
the fools among us have done? This is but 
Your test—with it You misguide whomever 
You will, and guide whomever You will. You 
are our Protector, so forgive us, and have 
mercy on us. You are the Best of Forgivers.”
156. “And inscribe for us goodness in this 
world, and in the Hereafter. We have turned 
to You.” He said, “My punishment—I inflict 
it upon whomever I will, but My mercy en￾compasses all things. I will specify it for those 
who act righteously and practice regular 
charity, and those who believe in Our signs.”
157. Those who follow the Messenger, the Un￾lettered Prophet, whom they find mentioned 
in the Torah and the Gospel in their posses￾sion. He directs them to righteousness, and 
deters them from evil, and allows for them all 
good things, and prohibits for them wicked￾ness, and unloads the burdens and the shack￾les that are upon them. Those who believe in 
him, and respect him, and support him, and 
follow the light that came down with him—
these are the successful.
158. Say, “O people, I am the Messenger of Al￾lah to you all—He to whom belongs the king￾dom of the heavens and the earth. There is no 
god but He. He gives life and causes death.” 
So believe in Allah and His Messenger, the 
Unlettered Prophet, who believes in Allah 
and His words. And follow him, that you may 
be guided.
159. Among the people of Moses is a commu￾nity that guides by truth, and thereby does 
justice.
160. We divided them into twelve tribal com￾munities. And We inspired Moses, when his 
people asked him for something to drink: 
“Strike the rock with your staff.” Whereupon 
twelve springs gushed from it. Each group 
recognized its drinking-place. And We 
shaded them with clouds, and We sent down 
upon them manna and quails: “Eat of the 
good things We have provided for you.” They 
did not wrong Us, but they used to wrong 
their own selves.
161. And it was said to them, “Settle this town, 
and eat therein whatever you wish, and speak 
modestly, and enter the gate in humility—
We will forgive your sins, and will promote 
the righteous.”
162. But the wicked among them substituted 
other words for the words given to them; so 
We sent down upon them a plague from the 
sky, because of their wrongdoing.
60
7. THE ELEVATIONS (al-A’raf)
163. Ask them about the town by the sea, when 
they violated the Sabbath. When they ob￾served the Sabbath, their fish would come to 
them abundantly. But when they violated the 
Sabbath, their fish would not come to them. 
Thus We tried them because they disobeyed.
164. And when a group of them said, “Why do 
you counsel a people whom Allah will anni￾hilate, or punish with a severe punishment?” 
They said, “As an excuse to your Lord, and so 
that they may become righteous.”
165. Then, when they neglected what they were 
reminded of, We saved those who prohibited 
evil, and We seized those who did wrong with 
a terrible punishment, because of their sinful￾ness.
166. Then, when they rebelled against the com￾mands to refrain, We said to them, “Be des￾picable apes.”
167. Your Lord has announced that, He would 
send against them, until the Day of Resurrec￾tion, those who would inflict terrible suffer￾ing upon them. Your Lord is swift in retribu￾tion, yet He is Forgiving and Merciful.
168. And We scattered them into communities 
on earth. Some of them righteous, and some 
of them short of that. And We tested them 
with fortunes and misfortunes, so that they 
may return.
169. They were succeeded by generations who 
inherited the Scripture and chose the materi￾als of this world, saying, “We will be for￾given.” And should similar materials come 
their way, they would again seize them. Did 
they not make a covenant to uphold the 
Scripture, and to not say about Allah except 
the truth? Did they not study its contents? 
But the Home of the Hereafter is better for 
the cautious; will you not understand?
170. Those who adhere to the Scripture, and 
practice prayer—We will not waste the re￾ward of the reformers.
171. And when We suspended the mountain 
over them, as if it was an umbrella, and they 
thought it would fall on them: “Hold fast to 
what We have given you, and remember what 
it contains, so that you may be saved.”
172. And when Your Lord summoned the de￾scendants of Adam, and made them testify 
about themselves. “Am I not your Lord?” 
They said, “Yes, we testify.” Thus you cannot 
say on the Day of Resurrection, “We were un￾aware of this.”
173. Nor can you Say, “Our ancestors practiced 
idolatry before; and we are their descendants 
who came after them; will you destroy us for 
what the falsifiers did?”
174. We thus elaborate the revelations, so that 
they may return.
175. And relate to them the story of him to 
whom We delivered Our signs, but he de￾tached himself from them, so Satan went af￾ter him, and he became one of the perverts.
176. Had We willed, We could have elevated 
him through them; but he clung to the 
ground, and followed his desires. His meta￾phor is that of a dog: if you chase it, it pants; 
and if you leave it alone, it pants. Such is the 
metaphor of the people who deny Our signs. 
So tell the tale, so that they may ponder.
177. Evil is the metaphor of the people who re￾ject Our signs and wrong themselves.
178. Whomever Allah guides is the guided one. 
And whomever He sends astray—these are 
the losers.
179. We have destined for Hell multitudes of 
jinn and humans. They have hearts with 
which they do not understand. They have 
eyes with which they do not see. They have 
ears with which they do not hear. These are 
like cattle. In fact, they are further astray. 
These are the heedless.
180. To Allah belong the Most Beautiful 
Names, so call Him by them, and disregard 
those who blaspheme His names. They will 
be repaid for what they used to do.
181. Among those We created is a commu￾nity—they guide by truth, and do justice 
thereby.
61
7. THE ELEVATIONS (al-A’raf)
182. As for those who reject Our messages, We 
will gradually lead them from where they do 
not know.
183. And I will encourage them. My plan is 
firm.
184. Do they not think? There is no madness in 
their friend. He is but a plain warner.
185. Have they not observed the government of 
the heavens and the earth, and all the things 
that Allah created, and that their time may 
have drawn near? Which message, besides 
this, will they believe in?
186. Whomever Allah misguides has no guide. 
And He leaves them blundering in their 
transgression. 
187. They ask you about the Hour, “When will 
it come?” Say, “Knowledge of it rests with my 
Lord. None can reveal its coming except He. 
It weighs heavily on the heavens and the 
earth. It will not come upon you except sud￾denly.” They ask you as if you are responsible 
for it. Say, “Knowledge of it rests with Allah,” 
but most people do not know.
188. Say, “I have no control over any benefit or 
harm to myself, except as Allah wills. Had I 
known the future, I would have acquired 
much good, and no harm would have 
touched me. I am only a warner, and a herald 
of good news to a people who believe.”
189. It is He who created you from a single per￾son, and made from it its mate, that he may 
find comfort with her. Then, when he has 
covered her, she conceives a light load, and 
she carries it around. But when she has grown 
heavy, they pray to Allah their Lord, “if You 
give us a good child, we will be among the 
thankful.”
190. But when He has given them a good child, 
they attribute partners to Him in what He has 
given them. Allah is exalted above what they 
associate.
191. Do they idolize those who create nothing, 
and are themselves created?
192. And can neither help them, nor help their 
own selves?
193. And if you invite them to guidance, they 
will not follow you. It is the same for you, 
whether you invite them, or remain silent.
194. Those you call upon besides Allah are 
servants like you. So call upon them, and let 
them answer you, if you are truthful.
195. Do they have feet with which they walk? 
Or do they have hands with which they 
strike? Or do they have eyes with which they 
see? Or do they have ears with which they 
hear? Say, “Call upon your partners, then plot 
against me, and do not wait.”
196. “My Master is Allah, He Who sent down 
the Book, and He takes care of the righteous.”
197. Those you call upon besides Him cannot 
help you, nor can they help themselves.
198. And if you call them to guidance, they will 
not hear. And you see them looking at you, 
yet they do not see.
199. Be tolerant, and command decency, and 
avoid the ignorant.
200. And when a suggestion from Satan assails 
you, take refuge with Allah. He is Hearing 
and Knowing.
201. Those who are righteous—when an im￾pulse from Satan strikes them, they remind 
themselves, and immediately see clearly.
202. But their brethren lead them relentlessly 
into error, and they never stop short.
203. If you do not produce a miracle for them, 
they say, “Why don’t you improvise one.” 
Say, “I only follow what is inspired to me 
from my Lord.” These are insights from your 
Lord, and guidance, and mercy, for a people 
who believe.
204. When the Quran is recited, listen to it, and 
pay attention, so that you may experience 
mercy.
205. And remember your Lord within yourself, 
humbly and fearfully, and quietly, in the 
morning and the evening, and do not be of 
the neglectful.
206. Those who are in the presence of your 
Lord are not too proud to worship Him. They 
62
8. THE SPOILS (al-Anfal)
recite His praises, and to Him they bow 
down.
8. THE SPOILS
(al-Anfal)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. They ask you about the bounties. Say, “The 
bounties are for Allah and the Messenger.” So 
be mindful of Allah, and settle your differ￾ences, and obey Allah and His Messenger, if 
you are believers.
2. The believers are those whose hearts trem￾ble when Allah is mentioned, and when His 
revelations are recited to them, they 
strengthen them in faith, and upon their Lord 
they rely.
3. Those who perform the prayer; and from 
Our provisions to them, they spend.
4. These are the true believers. They have high 
standing with their Lord, and forgiveness, 
and a generous provision.
5. Even as your Lord brought you out of your 
home with the truth, some believers were re￾luctant.
6. Arguing with you about the truth after it 
was made clear, as if they were being driven 
to death as they looked on.
7. Allah has promised you one of the two 
groups—that it would be yours—but you 
wanted the unarmed group to be yours. Allah 
intends to prove the truth with His words, 
and to uproot the disbelievers.
8. In order to confirm the truth and nullify 
falsehood, even though the guilty dislike it.
9. When you appealed to your Lord for help, 
He answered you, “I am reinforcing you with 
one thousand angels in succession.”
10. Allah only made it a message of hope, and 
to set your hearts at rest. Victory comes only 
from Allah. Allah is Mighty and Wise.
11. He made drowsiness overcome you, as a se￾curity from Him. And He sent down upon 
you water from the sky, to cleanse you with 
it, and to rid you of Satan’s pollution, and to 
fortify your hearts, and to strengthen your 
foothold.
12. Your Lord inspired the angels: “I am with 
you, so support those who believe. I will cast 
terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. 
So strike above the necks, and strike off every 
fingertip of theirs.”
13. That is because they opposed Allah and His 
Messenger. Whoever opposes Allah and His 
Messenger—Allah is severe in retribution.
14. “Here it is; so taste it.” For the disbelievers 
there is the suffering of the Fire.
15. O you who believe! When you meet those 
who disbelieve on the march, never turn your 
backs on them.
16. Anyone who turns his back on them on 
that Day, except while maneuvering for bat￾tle, or to join another group, has incurred 
wrath from Allah, and his abode is Hell—
what a miserable destination!
17. It was not you who killed them, but it was 
Allah who killed them. And it was not you 
who launched when you launched, but it was 
Allah who launched. That He may bestow 
upon the believers an excellent reward. Allah 
is Hearing and Knowing. 
18. Such is the case. Allah will undermine the 
strategy of the disbelievers.
19. If you desire a verdict, the verdict has come 
to you. And if you desist, it would be best for 
you. And if you return, We will return; and 
your troops, however numerous, will not 
benefit you. Allah is with the believers.
20. O you who believe! Obey Allah and His 
Messenger, and do not turn away from him 
when you hear.
21. And be not like those who say, “We hear,” 
when they do not hear.
22. The worst of animals to Allah are the deaf 
and dumb—those who do not reason.
23. Had Allah recognized any good in them, 
He would have made them hear; and had He 
63
8. THE SPOILS (al-Anfal)
made them hear, they would have turned 
away defiantly.
24. O you who believe! Respond to Allah and 
to the Messenger when He calls you to what 
will revive you. And know that Allah stands 
between a man and his heart, and that to Him 
you will be gathered.
25. And beware of discord which does not af￾flict the wrongdoers among you exclusively; 
and know that Allah is severe in retribution.
26. And remember when you were few, op￾pressed in the land, fearing that people may 
capture you; but He sheltered you, and sup￾ported you with His victory, and provided 
you with good things—so that you may be 
thankful.
27. O you who believe! Do not betray Allah 
and the Messenger, nor betray your trusts, 
while you know.
28. And know that your possessions and your 
children are a test, and that Allah possesses 
an immense reward. 
29. O you who believe! If you remain con￾scious of Allah, He will give you a criterion, 
and will remit from you your sins, and will 
forgive you. Allah is possessor of infinite 
grace.
30. When the disbelievers plotted against you, 
to imprison you, or kill you, or expel you. 
They planned, and Allah planned, but Allah 
is the Best of planners.
31. And when Our revelations are recited to 
them, they say, “We have heard. Had we 
wanted, we could have said the like of this; 
these are nothing but myths of the ancients.”
32. And they said, “Our God, if this is the truth 
from You, then rain down on us stones from 
the sky, or visit us with a painful affliction.”
33. But Allah would not punish them while 
you are amongst them. And Allah would not 
punish them as long as they seek forgiveness.
34. Yet why should Allah not punish them, 
when they are turning others away from the 
Sacred Mosque, although they are not its cus￾todians? Its rightful custodians are the pious; 
but most of them do not know.
35. Their prayer at the House was nothing but 
whistling and clapping—so taste the punish￾ment for your blasphemy.
36. Those who disbelieve spend their wealth to 
repel from Allah’s path. They will spend it, 
then it will become a source of sorrow for 
them, and then they will be defeated. Those 
who disbelieve will be herded into Hell.
37. That Allah may distinguish the bad from 
the good, and heap the bad on top of one an￾other, and pile them together, and throw 
them in Hell. These are the losers.
38. Say to those who disbelieve: if they desist, 
their past will be forgiven. But if they per￾sist—the practice of the ancients has passed 
away.
39. Fight them until there is no more persecu￾tion, and religion becomes exclusively for Al￾lah. But if they desist—Allah is Seeing of what 
they do.
40. And if they turn away, know that Allah is 
your Protector. The Best Protector, and the 
Best Supporter.
41. And know that whatever spoils you gain, to 
Allah belongs its fifth, and to the Messenger, 
and the relatives, and the orphans, and the 
poor, and to the wayfarer, provided you be￾lieve in Allah and in what We revealed to Our 
servant on the Day of Distinction, the day 
when the two armies met. Allah is Capable of 
everything.
42. Recall when you were on the nearer bank, 
and they were on the further bank, and the 
caravan was below you. Had you planned for 
this meeting, you would have disagreed on 
the timing, but Allah was to carry out a pre￾determined matter, so that those who perish 
would perish by clear evidence, and those 
who survive would survive by clear evidence. 
Allah is Hearing and Knowing.
43. Allah made them appear in your dream as 
few. Had He made them appear as many, you 
would have lost heart, and disputed in the 
64
8. THE SPOILS (al-Anfal)
matter. But Allah saved the situation. He 
knows what the hearts contain.
44. When you met, He made them appear as 
few in your eyes, and made you appear fewer 
in their eyes, so that Allah may conclude a 
predetermined matter. To Allah all matters 
revert.
45. O you who believe! When you meet a force, 
stand firm, and remember Allah much, so 
that you may prevail.
46. And obey Allah and His Messenger, and do 
not dispute, lest you falter and lose your 
courage. And be steadfast. Allah is with the 
steadfast.
47. And do not be like those who left their 
homes boastfully, showing off before the peo￾ple, and barring others from the path of Al￾lah. Allah comprehends what they do.
48. Satan made their deeds appear good to 
them, and said, “You cannot be defeated by 
any people today, and I am at your side.” But 
when the two armies came in sight of one an￾other, he turned on his heels, and said, “I am 
innocent of you; I see what you do not see; I 
fear Allah; Allah is severe in punishment.”
49. The hypocrites and those in whose hearts 
is sickness said, “Their religion has deluded 
these people.” But whoever puts his trust in 
Allah—Allah is Mighty and Wise.
50. If only you could see, as the angels take 
away those who disbelieve, striking their 
faces and their backs: “Taste the agony of the 
Burning.”
51. “That is because of what your hands have 
committed, and because Allah is not unjust 
to the servants.”
52. Like the behavior of the people of Pharaoh, 
and those before them. They rejected the 
signs of Allah, so Allah seized them for their 
sins. Allah is Powerful, Severe in punishment.
53. That is because Allah would never change 
a blessing He has bestowed on a people unless 
they change what is within themselves, and 
because Allah is Hearing and Knowing.
54. Such was the case with the people of Phar￾aoh, and those before them. They denied the 
signs of their Lord, so We annihilated them 
for their wrongs, and We drowned the people 
of Pharaoh—they were all evildoers.
55. The worst of creatures in Allah's view are 
those who disbelieve. They have no faith.
56. Those of them with whom you made a 
treaty, but they violate their agreement every 
time. They are not righteous.
57. If you confront them in battle, make of 
them a fearsome example for those who fol￾low them, that they may take heed.
58. If you fear treachery on the part of a people, 
break off with them in a like manner. Allah 
does not like the treacherous.
59. Let not the disbelievers assume that they 
are ahead. They will not escape.
60. And prepare against them all the power 
you can muster, and all the cavalry you can 
mobilize, to terrify thereby Allah’s enemies 
and your enemies, and others besides them 
whom you do not know, but Allah knows 
them. Whatever you spend in Allah’s way will 
be repaid to you in full, and you will not be 
wronged.
61. But if they incline towards peace, then in￾cline towards it, and put your trust in Allah. 
He is the Hearer, the Knower.
62. If they intend to deceive you—Allah is suf￾ficient for you. It is He who supported you 
with His aid, and with the believers.
63. And He united their hearts. Had you spent 
everything on earth, you would not have 
united their hearts, but Allah united them to￾gether. He is Mighty and Wise.
64. O prophet! Count on Allah, and on the be￾lievers who have followed you.
65. O prophet! Rouse the believers to battle. If 
there are twenty steadfast among you, they 
will defeat two hundred; and if there are a 
hundred of you, they will defeat a thousand 
of those who disbelieve; because they are a 
people who do not understand.
65
9. REPENTANCE (at-Tawbah)
66. Allah has now lightened your burden, 
knowing that there is weakness in you. If 
there are a hundred steadfast among you, 
they will defeat two hundred; and if there are 
a thousand of you, they will defeat two thou￾sand by Allah’s leave. Allah is with the stead￾fast.
67. It is not for a prophet to take prisoners be￾fore he has subdued the land. You desire the 
materials of this world, but Allah desires the 
Hereafter. Allah is Strong and Wise.
68. Were it not for a predetermined decree 
from Allah, an awful punishment would have 
afflicted you for what you have taken.
69. So consume what you have gained, legiti￾mate and wholesome; and remain conscious 
of Allah. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
70. O prophet! Say to those you hold prisoners, 
“If Allah finds any good in your hearts, He 
will give you better than what was taken from 
you, and He will forgive you. Allah is Forgiv￾ing and Merciful.”
71. But if they intend to betray you, they have 
already betrayed Allah, and He has overpow￾ered them. Allah is Knowing and Wise.
72. Those who believed, and emigrated, and 
struggled in Allah’s cause with their posses￾sions and their persons, and those who pro￾vided shelter and support—these are allies of 
one another. As for those who believed, but 
did not emigrate, you owe them no protec￾tion, until they have emigrated. But if they 
ask you for help in religion, you must come 
to their aid, except against a people with 
whom you have a treaty. Allah is Seeing of 
what you do.
73. As for those who disbelieve, they are allies 
of one another. Unless you do this, there will 
be turmoil in the land, and much corruption.
74. Those who believed, and emigrated, and 
struggled for Allah’s cause, and those who 
gave shelter and support—these are the true 
believers. They will have forgiveness, and a 
bountiful provision.
75. As for those who believed afterwards, and 
emigrated and struggled with you—these be￾long with you. But family members are 
nearer to one another in the Book of Allah. 
Allah is Cognizant of everything.
9. REPENTANCE
(at-Tawbah)
1. A declaration of immunity from Allah and 
His Messenger to the polytheists with whom 
you had made a treaty. 
2. So travel the land for four months, and 
know that you cannot escape Allah, and that 
Allah will disgrace the disbelievers.
3. And a proclamation from Allah and His 
Messenger to the people on the day of the 
Greater Pilgrimage, that Allah has disowned 
the polytheists, and so did His Messenger. If 
you repent, it will be better for you. But if you 
turn away, know that you cannot escape Al￾lah. And announce to those who disbelieve a 
painful punishment.
4. Except for those among the polytheists with 
whom you had made a treaty, and did not vi￾olate any of its terms, nor aided anyone 
against you. So fulfill the treaty with them to 
the end of its term. Allah loves the righteous.
5. When the Sacred Months have passed, kill 
the polytheists wherever you find them. And 
capture them, and besiege them, and lie in 
wait for them at every ambush. But if they re￾pent, and perform the prayers, and pay the 
alms, then let them go their way. Allah is 
Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.
6. And if anyone of the polytheists asks you for 
protection, give him protection so that he 
may hear the Word of Allah; then escort him 
to his place of safety. That is because they are 
a people who do not know.
7. How can there be a treaty with the polythe￾ists on the part of Allah and His Messenger, 
except for those with whom you made a 
treaty at the Sacred Mosque? As long as they 
are upright with you, be upright with them. 
Allah loves the pious.
66
9. REPENTANCE (at-Tawbah)
8. How? Whenever they overcome you, they 
respect neither kinship nor treaty with you. 
They satisfy you with lip service, but their 
hearts refuse, and most of them are immoral.
9. They traded away Allah's revelations for a 
cheap price, so they barred others from His 
path. How evil is what they did.
10. Towards a believer they respect neither 
kinship nor treaty. These are the transgres￾sors.
11. But if they repent, and perform the prayers, 
and give the obligatory charity, then they are 
your brethren in faith. We detail the revela￾tions for a people who know.
12. But if they violate their oaths after their 
pledge, and attack your religion, then fight 
the leaders of disbelief—they have no faith—
so that they may desist.
13. Will you not fight a people who violated 
their oaths, and planned to exile the Messen￾ger, and initiated hostilities against you? Do 
you fear them? It is Allah you should fear, if 
you are believers.
14. Fight them. Allah will punish them at your 
hands, and humiliate them, and help you 
against them, and heal the hearts of a believ￾ing people.
15. And He will remove the anger of their 
hearts. Allah redeems whomever He wills. 
Allah is Knowledgeable and Wise.
16. Or do you think that you will be left alone, 
without Allah identifying which of you will 
strive, and take no supporters apart from Al￾lah, His Messenger, and the believers? Allah 
is well Aware of what you do.
17. It is not for the polytheists to attend Allah’s 
places of worship while professing their dis￾belief. These—their works are in vain, and in 
the Fire they will abide.
18. The only people to attend Allah’s places of 
worship are those who believe in Allah and 
the Last Day, and pray regularly, and practice 
regular charity, and fear none but Allah. 
These are most likely to be guided.
19. Do you consider giving water to pilgrims 
and maintaining the Sacred Mosque the same 
as believing in Allah and the Last Day and 
striving in Allah’s path? They are not equal in 
Allah’s sight. Allah does not guide the unjust 
people.
20. Those who believe, and emigrate, and 
strive in Allah’s path with their possessions 
and their persons, are of a higher rank with 
Allah. These are the winners.
21. Their Lord announces to them good news 
of mercy from Him, and acceptance, and gar￾dens wherein they will have lasting bliss.
22. Abiding therein forever. With Allah is a 
great reward.
23. O you who believe! Do not ally yourselves 
with your parents and your siblings if they 
prefer disbelief to belief. Whoever of you al￾lies himself with them—these are the wrong￾doers.
24. Say, “If your parents, and your children, 
and your siblings, and your spouses, and your 
relatives, and the wealth you have acquired, 
and a business you worry about, and homes 
you love, are more dear to you than Allah, 
and His Messenger, and the struggle in His 
cause, then wait until Allah executes His 
judgment.” Allah does not guide the sinful 
people.
25. Allah has given you victory in numerous 
regions; but on the day of Hunayn, your great 
number impressed you, but it availed you 
nothing; and the land, as spacious as it was, 
narrowed for you; and you turned your backs 
in retreat.
26. Then Allah sent down His serenity upon 
His Messenger, and upon the believers; and 
He sent down troops you did not see; and He 
punished those who disbelieved. Such is the 
recompense of the disbelievers.
27. Then, after that, Allah will relent towards 
whomever He wills. Allah is Forgiving and 
Merciful.
28. O you who believe! The polytheists are pol￾luted, so let them not approach the Sacred 
Mosque after this year of theirs. And if you 
67
9. REPENTANCE (at-Tawbah)
fear poverty, Allah will enrich you from His 
grace, if He wills. Allah is Aware and Wise.
29. Fight those who do not believe in Allah, 
nor in the Last Day, nor forbid what Allah 
and His Messenger have forbidden, nor abide 
by the religion of truth—from among those 
who received the Scripture—until they pay 
the due tax, willingly or unwillingly.
30. The Jews said, “Ezra is the son of Allah,” 
and the Christians said, “The Messiah is the 
son of Allah.” These are their statements, out 
of their mouths. They emulate the statements 
of those who blasphemed before. May Allah 
assail them! How deceived they are!
31. They have taken their rabbis and their 
priests as lords instead of Allah, as well as the 
Messiah son of Mary. Although they were 
commanded to worship none but The One 
God. There is no god except He. Glory be to 
Him; High above what they associate with 
Him.
32. They want to extinguish Allah’s light with 
their mouths, but Allah refuses except to 
complete His light, even though the disbe￾lievers dislike it.
33. It is He who sent His Messenger with the 
guidance and the religion of truth, in order to 
make it prevail over all religions, even though 
the idolaters dislike it.
34. O you who believe! Many of the rabbis and 
priests consume people's wealth illicitly, and 
hinder from Allah’s path. Those who hoard 
gold and silver, and do not spend them in Al￾lah’s cause, inform them of a painful punish￾ment.
35. On the Day when they will be heated in the 
Fire of Hell, then their foreheads, and their 
sides, and their backs will be branded with 
them: “This is what you hoarded for your￾selves; so taste what you used to hoard.”
36. The number of months, according to Al￾lah, is twelve months—in the decree of Al￾lah—since the Day He created the heavens 
and the earth, of which four are sacred. This 
is the correct religion. So do not wrong your￾selves during them. And fight the polytheists 
collectively, as they fight you collectively, and 
know that Allah is with the righteous.
37. Postponement is an increase in disbelief—
by which those who disbelieve are led astray. 
They allow it one year, and forbid it another 
year, in order to conform to the number 
made sacred by Allah, thus permitting what 
Allah has forbidden. The evil of their deeds 
seems good to them. Allah does not guide the 
disbelieving people.
38. O you who believe! What is the matter with 
you, when it is said to you, “Mobilize in the 
cause of Allah,” you cling heavily to the 
earth? Do you prefer the present life to the 
Hereafter? The enjoyment of the present life, 
compared to the Hereafter, is only a little.
39. Unless you mobilize, He will punish you 
most painfully, and will replace you with an￾other people, and you will not harm Him at 
all. Allah has power over all things.
40. If you do not help him, Allah has already
helped him, when those who disbelieved ex￾pelled him, and he was the second of two in 
the cave. He said to his friend, “Do not worry, 
Allah is with us.” And Allah made His tran￾quility descend upon him, and supported 
him with forces you did not see, and made the 
word of those who disbelieved the lowest, 
while the Word of Allah is the Highest. Allah 
is Mighty and Wise.
41. Mobilize, light or heavy, and strive with 
your possessions and your lives in the cause 
of Allah. That is better for you, if you only 
knew.
42. Had the gain been immediate, and the 
journey shorter, they would have followed 
you; but the distance seemed too long for 
them. Still they swear by Allah: “Had we been 
able, we would have marched out with you.” 
They damn their own souls, and Allah knows 
that they are lying.
43. May Allah pardon you! Why did you give 
them permission before it became clear to 
you who are the truthful ones, and who are 
the liars?
68
9. REPENTANCE (at-Tawbah)
44. Those who believe in Allah and the Last 
Day do not ask you for exemption from striv￾ing with their possessions and their lives. Al￾lah is fully aware of the righteous.
45. Only those who do not believe in Allah and 
the Last Day ask you for exemption. Their 
hearts are full of doubts, so they waver in 
their doubts.
46. Had they wanted to mobilize, they would 
have made preparations for it; but Allah dis￾liked their participation, so he held them 
back, and it was said, “Stay behind with those 
who stay behind.”
47. Had they mobilized with you, they would 
have added only to your difficulties, and they 
would have spread rumors in your midst, try￾ing to sow discord among you. Some of you 
are avid listeners to them. Allah is Aware of 
the wrongdoers.
48. They tried to cause conflict before, and 
they hatched plots against you, until the truth 
prevailed, and the command of Allah became 
evident—in spite of their dislike.
49. Among them is he who says, “Excuse me, 
and do not trouble me.” In fact, they sunk 
into trouble. In fact, Hell will engulf the dis￾believers.
50. If something good happens to you, it up￾sets them; and if a calamity befalls you, they 
say, “We took our precautions in advance,” 
and they depart, happy.
51. Say, “Nothing will happen to us except 
what Allah has ordained for us; He is our Pro￾tector.” In Allah let the faithful put their trust.
52. Say, “Are you expecting for us anything 
other than one of the two excellences? As for 
us: we are expecting that Allah will afflict you 
with a punishment from Himself, or at our 
hands. So wait, we are waiting with you.”
53. Say, “Whether you spend willingly or un￾willingly, it will not be accepted from you. 
You are evil people.”
54. What prevents the acceptance of their con￾tributions is nothing but the fact that they 
disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger, and 
that they do not approach the prayer except 
lazily, and that they do not spend except 
grudgingly.
55. Let neither their possessions nor their chil￾dren impress you. Allah intends to torment 
them through them in this worldly life, and 
that their souls depart while they are disbe￾lievers.
56. They swear by Allah that they are of you. 
But they are not of you. They are divisive peo￾ple.
57. Were they to find a shelter, or a cave, or a 
hideout, they would go to it, rushing.
58. And among them are those who criticize 
you in regard to charities. If they are given 
some of it, they become pleased; but if they 
are not given any, they grow resentful.
59. If only they were content with what Allah 
and His Messenger have given them, and 
said, “Allah is sufficient for us; Allah will give 
us of His bounty, and so will His Messenger; 
to Allah we eagerly turn.”
60. Charities are for the poor, and the desti￾tute, and those who administer them, and for 
reconciling hearts, and for freeing slaves, and 
for those in debt, and in the path of Allah, and 
for the traveler in need—an obligation from 
Allah. Allah is All-Knowing, Most Wise.
61. And among them are those who insult the 
Prophet, and say, “He is all ears.” Say, “He lis￾tens for your own good. He believes in Allah, 
and trusts the believers, and is mercy for 
those of you who believe.” Those who insult 
the Messenger of Allah will have a painful 
penalty.
62. They swear to you by Allah to please you. 
But it is more proper for them to please Allah 
and His Messenger, if they are believers.
63. Do they not know that whoever opposes 
Allah and His Messenger, will have the Fire 
of Hell, abiding in it forever? That is the su￾preme disgrace.
64. The hypocrites worry lest a chapter may be 
revealed about them, informing them of what 
69
9. REPENTANCE (at-Tawbah)
is in their hearts. Say, “Go on mocking; Allah 
will bring out what you fear.”
65. If you ask them, they will say, “We were 
just joking and playing.” Say, “Were you 
making jokes about Allah, His revelations, 
and His Messenger?”
66. Do not apologize. You have disbelieved af￾ter your belief. If We pardon some of you, We 
will punish others, because they are guilty.
67. The hypocrite men and hypocrite women 
are of one another. They advocate evil, and 
prohibit righteousness, and withhold their 
hands. They forgot Allah, so He forgot them. 
The hypocrites are the sinners.
68. Allah has promised the hypocrite men and 
hypocrite women, and the disbelievers, the 
Fire of Hell, abiding therein forever. It is their 
due. And Allah has cursed them. They will 
have a lasting punishment.
69. Like those before you. They were more 
powerful than you, and had more wealth and 
children. They enjoyed their share, and you 
enjoyed your share, as those before you en￾joyed their share. And you indulged, as they 
indulged. It is they whose works will fail in 
this world and in the Hereafter. It is they who 
are the losers.
70. Have they not heard the stories of those be￾fore them? The people of Noah, and Aad, and 
Thamood; and the people of Abraham, and 
the inhabitants of Median, and the Over￾turned Cities? Their messengers came to 
them with the clear proofs. Allah never 
wronged them, but they used to wrong their 
own selves.
71. The believing men and believing women 
are friends of one another. They advocate vir￾tue, forbid evil, perform the prayers, practice 
charity, and obey Allah and His Messenger. 
These—Allah will have mercy on them. Allah 
is Noble and Wise.
72. Allah promises the believers, men and 
women, gardens beneath which rivers flow, 
abiding therein forever, and fine homes in 
the Gardens of Eden. But approval from Al￾lah is even greater. That is the supreme 
achievement.
73. O Prophet! Strive against the disbelievers 
and the hypocrites, and be stern with them. 
Their abode is Hell—what a miserable desti￾nation!
74. They swear by Allah that they said nothing; 
but they did utter the word of blasphemy, and 
they renounced faith after their submission. 
And they plotted what they could not attain. 
They were resentful only because Allah and 
His Messenger have enriched them out of His 
grace. If they repent, it would be best for 
them; but if they turn away, Allah will afflict 
them with a painful punishment—in this life 
and in the Hereafter—and they will have on 
earth no protector and no savior.
75. Among them are those who promised Al￾lah: “If He gives us of His bounty, we will do￾nate and be among the upright.”
76. But when He has given them of His bounty, 
they became stingy with it, and turned away 
in aversion.
77. So He penalized them with hypocrisy in 
their hearts, until the Day they face Him—be￾cause they broke their promise to Allah, and 
because they used to lie.
78. Do they not know that Allah knows their 
secrets and their conspiracies? And that Allah 
is the Knower of the unseen?
79. Those who criticize the believers who give 
charity voluntarily, and ridicule those who 
find nothing to give except their own ef￾forts—Allah ridicules them. They will have a 
painful punishment.
80. Whether you ask forgiveness for them, or 
do not ask forgiveness for them—even if you 
ask forgiveness for them seventy times, Allah 
will not forgive them. That is because they 
disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger. Al￾lah does not guide the immoral people.
81. Those who stayed behind rejoiced at their 
staying behind the Messenger of Allah. And 
they hated to strive with their wealth and 
their lives in Allah’s way. And they said, “Do 
70
9. REPENTANCE (at-Tawbah)
not venture out in the heat.” Say, “The Fire of 
Hell is much hotter, if they only understood.”
82. Let them laugh a little, and weep much; in 
recompense for what they used to earn.
83. If Allah brings you back to a party of them, 
and they ask your permission to go out, say, 
“You will not go out with me, ever, nor will 
you ever fight an enemy with me. You were 
content to sit back the first time, so sit back 
with those who stay behind.”
84. You are never to pray over anyone of them 
who dies, nor are you to stand at his grave￾side. They rejected Allah and His Messenger, 
and died while they were sinners.
85. Do not let their possessions and their chil￾dren impress you. Allah desires to torment 
them through them in this world, and their 
souls expire while they are disbelievers.
86. When a chapter is revealed, stating: “Be￾lieve in Allah and strive with His Messenger,” 
the prominent among them ask you for ex￾emption. They say, “Allow us to stay with 
those who stay behind.”
87. They prefer to be with those who stay be￾hind. Their hearts were sealed, so they do not 
understand.
88. But the Messenger and those who believe 
with him struggle with their possessions and 
their lives. These have deserved the good 
things. These are the successful.
89. Allah has prepared for them gardens be￾neath which rivers flow, wherein they will 
abide forever. That is the great victory.
90. Some of the Desert-Arabs came to make 
excuses, asking to be granted exemption, 
while those who were untrue to Allah and His 
Messenger stayed behind. A painful punish￾ment will afflict those among them who dis￾believed.
91. There is no blame on the weak, nor on the 
sick, nor on those who have nothing to give, 
provided they are true to Allah and His Mes￾senger. In no way can the righteous be 
blamed. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
92. Nor on those who approach you, wishing 
to ride with you, and you said, “I have noth￾ing to carry you on.” So they went away, with 
their eyes overflowing with tears, sorrowing 
for not finding the means to spend.
93. But blame is on those who ask you for ex￾emption, although they are rich. They are 
content to be with those who stay behind. Al￾lah has sealed their hearts, so they do not 
know.
94. They present excuses to you when you re￾turn to them. Say, “Do not offer excuses; we 
do not trust you; Allah has informed us of 
you. And Allah will watch your actions, and 
so will the Messenger; then you will be re￾turned to the Knower of the Invisible and the 
Visible, and He will inform you of what you 
used to do.”
95. They will swear to you by Allah, when you 
return to them, that you may leave them 
alone. So leave them alone. They are a dis￾grace, and their destiny is Hell; a reward for 
what they used to earn.
96. They will swear to you that you may accept 
them. But even if you accept them, Allah does 
not accept the wicked people.
97. The Desert-Arabs are the most steeped in 
disbelief and hypocrisy, and the most likely to 
ignore the limits that Allah revealed to His 
Messenger. Allah is Knowing and Wise.
98. And among the Desert-Arabs are those 
who consider their contribution to be a fine. 
And they wait for a reversal of your fortunes. 
Upon them will fall the cycle of misfortune. 
Allah is Hearing and Knowing.
99. Yet among the Desert-Arabs are those who 
believe in Allah and the Last Day, and con￾sider their contribution to be a means to￾wards Allah, and the prayers of the Messen￾ger. Surely it will draw them closer, and Allah 
will admit them into His mercy. Allah is For￾giving and Compassionate.
100. The Pioneers—The first of the Migrants 
and the Supporters, and those who followed 
them in righteousness. Allah is pleased with 
them, and they are pleased with Him. He has 
71
9. REPENTANCE (at-Tawbah)
prepared for them Gardens beneath which 
rivers flow, where they will abide forever. 
That is the sublime triumph.
101. Among the Desert-Arabs around you 
there are some hypocrites, and among the in￾habitants of Medina too. They have become 
adamant in hypocrisy. You do not know 
them, but We know them. We will punish 
them twice; then they will be returned to a se￾vere torment.
102. Others have confessed their sins, having 
mixed good deeds with bad deeds. Perhaps 
Allah will redeem them. Allah is Forgiving 
and Merciful.
103. Receive contributions from their wealth, 
to purify them and sanctify them with it; and 
pray for them. Your prayer is comfort for 
them. Allah is Hearing and Knowing.
104. Do they not know that Allah accepts the 
repentance of His servants, and that He re￾ceives the contributions, and that Allah is the 
Acceptor of Repentance, the Merciful?
105. Say, “Work. Allah will see your work, and 
so will His Messenger, and the believers. 
Then you will be returned to the Knower of 
secrets and declarations, and He will inform 
you of what you used to do.”
106. Others are held in suspense, awaiting Al￾lah’s decree, as to whether He will punish 
them, or accept their repentance. Allah is 
Aware and Wise.
107. Then there are those who establish a 
mosque to cause harm, and disbelief, and dis￾unity among the believers, and as an outpost 
for those who fight Allah and His Messenger. 
They will swear: “Our intentions are nothing 
but good.” But Allah bears witness that they 
are liars.
108. Do not stand in it, ever. A mosque 
founded upon piety from the first day is wor￾thier of your standing in it. In it are men who 
love to be purified. Allah loves those who pu￾rify themselves.
109. Is he who founds his structure upon piety 
and acceptance from Allah better, or he who 
founds his structure on the brink of a cliff 
that is about to tumble, so it tumbles with 
him into the Fire of Hell? Allah does not 
guide the unjust people.
110. The structure which they built will remain 
questionable in their hearts, until their hearts 
are stopped. Allah is Knowing and Wise.
111. Allah has purchased from the believers 
their lives and their properties in exchange 
for Paradise. They fight in Allah’s way, and 
they kill and get killed. It is a promise binding 
on Him in the Torah, and the Gospel, and the 
Quran. And who is more true to his promise 
than Allah? So rejoice in making such an ex￾change—that is the supreme triumph.
112. Those who repent, those who worship, 
those who praise, those who journey, those 
who kneel, those who bow down, those who 
advocate righteousness and forbid evil, and 
those who keep Allah’s limits—give good 
news to the believers.
113. It is not for the Prophet and those who be￾lieve to ask forgiveness for the polytheists, 
even if they are near relatives, after it has be￾come clear to them that they are people of 
Hellfire.
114. Abraham asked forgiveness for his father 
only because of a promise he had made to 
him. But when it became clear to him that he 
was an enemy of Allah, he disowned him. 
Abraham was kind and clement.
115. Allah would never lead a people astray, af￾ter He had guided them, until He makes clear 
to them what they should guard against. Al￾lah has knowledge of all things.
116. To Allah belongs the dominion of the 
heavens and the earth. He gives life, and He 
causes death. And besides Allah, you have 
neither protector, nor supporter.
117. Allah has redeemed the Prophet, and the 
Emigrants, and the Supporters—those who 
followed him in the hour of difficulty—after 
the hearts of some of them almost swerved. 
Then He pardoned them. He is Kind towards 
them, Compassionate.
118. Also towards the three who were left be￾hind. Then, when the earth, as vast as it is, 
72
10. JONAH (Yunus)
closed in on them, and their very souls closed 
in on them, and they realized that there was 
no refuge from Allah, except in Him, He re￾deemed them, so that they may repent. Allah 
is the Redeemer, the Merciful.
119. O you who believe! Be conscious of Allah, 
and be with the sincere.
120. It is not for the inhabitants of Medina and 
the Desert-Arabs around them to stay behind 
the Messenger of Allah, nor to prefer them￾selves to him. That is because they never suf￾fer any thirst, nor fatigue, nor hunger in the 
cause of Allah, nor do they take one step that 
enrages the disbelievers, nor do they gain an￾ything from an enemy, but it is recorded to 
their credit as a righteous deed. Allah does 
not waste the reward of the righteous.
121. Nor do they spend any expenditure, small 
or large, nor do they cross any valley, but it is 
recorded to their credit. That Allah may re￾ward them in accordance with the best of 
their deeds.
122. It is not advisable for the believers to 
march out altogether. Of every division that 
marches out, let a group remain behind, to 
gain understanding of the religion, and to no￾tify their people when they have returned to 
them, that they may beware.
123. O you who believe! Fight those of the dis￾believers who attack you, and let them find 
severity in you, and know that Allah is with 
the righteous.
124. Whenever a chapter is revealed, some of 
them say, “Which of you has this increased in 
faith?” As for those who believe: it increases 
them in faith, and they rejoice.
125. But as for those in whose hearts is sick￾ness: it adds disgrace to their disgrace, and 
they die as unbelievers.
126. Do they not see that they are tested once 
or twice every year? Yet they do not repent, 
and they do not learn. 
127. And whenever a chapter is revealed, they 
look at one another, “Does anyone see you?” 
Then they slip away. Allah has diverted their 
hearts, because they are a people who do not 
understand.
128. There has come to you a messenger from 
among yourselves, concerned over your suf￾fering, anxious over you. Towards the believ￾ers, he is compassionate and merciful.
129. If they turn away, say, “Allah is enough for 
me; there is no god except He; in Him I have 
put my trust; He is the Lord of the Sublime 
Throne.”
10. JONAH
(Yunus)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Alif, Lam, Ra. These are the Verses of the 
Wise Book.
2. Is it a wonder to the people that We inspired 
a man from among them: “Warn mankind, 
and give good news to those who believe that 
they are on a sound footing with their Lord”? 
The disbelievers said, “This is a manifest sor￾cerer.”
3. Your Lord is Allah, who created the heavens 
and the earth in six days, then settled over the 
Throne, governing all things. There is no in￾tercessor except after His permission. Such is 
Allah, your Lord—so serve Him. Will you not 
reflect?
4. To Him is your return, altogether. The 
promise of Allah is true. He originates crea￾tion, and then He repeats it, to reward those 
who believe and do good deeds with equity. 
As for those who disbelieve, for them is a 
drink of boiling water, and agonizing tor￾ment, on account of their disbelief.
5. It is He who made the sun radiant, and the 
moon a light, and determined phases for it—
that you may know the number of years and 
the calculation. Allah did not create all this 
except with truth. He details the revelations 
for a people who know.
73
10. JONAH (Yunus)
6. In the alternation of night and day, and in 
what Allah created in the heavens and the 
earth, are signs for people who are aware.
7. Those who do not hope to meet Us, and are 
content with the worldly life, and are at ease 
in it, and those who pay no heed to Our signs.
8. These—their dwelling is the Fire—on ac￾count of what they used to do.
9. As for those who believe and do good deeds, 
their Lord guides them in their faith. Rivers 
will flow beneath them in the Gardens of 
Bliss.
10. Their call therein is, “Glory be to You, our 
God.” And their greeting therein is, “Peace.” 
And the last of their call is, “Praise be to Al￾lah, Lord of the Worlds.”
11. If Allah were to accelerate the ill for the 
people, as they wish to accelerate the good, 
their term would have been fulfilled. But We 
leave those who do not expect Our encounter 
to blunder in their excesses.
12. Whenever adversity touches the human 
being, he prays to Us—reclining on his side, 
or sitting, or standing. But when We have re￾lieved his adversity from him, he goes away, 
as though he had never called on Us for trou￾ble that had afflicted him. Thus the deeds of 
the transgressors appear good to them.
13. We destroyed generations before you when 
they did wrong. Their messengers came to 
them with clear signs, but they would not be￾lieve. Thus We requite the sinful people.
14. Then We made you successors on earth af￾ter them, to see how you would behave.
15. And when Our clear revelations are recited 
to them, those who do not hope to meet Us 
say, “Bring a Quran other than this, or change 
it.” Say, “It is not for me to change it of my 
own accord. I only follow what is revealed to 
me. I fear, if I disobeyed my Lord, the tor￾ment of a terrible Day.”
16. Say, “Had Allah willed, I would not have 
recited it to you, and He would not have 
made it known to you. I have lived among 
you for a lifetime before it. Do you not un￾derstand?”
17. Who does greater wrong than someone 
who fabricates lies about Allah, or denies His 
revelations? The guilty will never prosper.
18. And they worship, besides Allah, what nei￾ther harms them nor benefits them. And they 
say, “These are our intercessors with Allah.” 
Say, “Are you informing Allah about what He 
does not know in the heavens or on earth?” 
Glorified be He, High above the associations 
they make.
19. Mankind was a single community; then 
they differed. Were it not for a prior decree 
from your Lord, the matters over which they 
had disputed would have been settled.
20. And they say, “If only a miracle was sent 
down to him from his Lord.” Say, “The realm 
of the unseen belongs to Allah; so wait, I am 
waiting with you.”
21. When We make the people taste mercy af￾ter some adversity has touched them, they 
begin to scheme against Our revelations. Say, 
“Allah is swifter in scheming.” Our envoys 
are writing down what you scheme.
22. It is He who transports you across land and 
sea. Until, when you are on ships, sailing in a 
favorable wind, and rejoicing in it, a raging 
wind arrives. The waves surge over them 
from every side, and they realize that they are 
besieged. Thereupon they pray to Allah, pro￾fessing sincere devotion to Him: “If You save 
us from this, we will be among the apprecia￾tive.”
23. But then, when He has saved them, they 
commit violations on earth, and oppose jus￾tice. O people! Your violations are against 
your own souls. It is the enjoyment of the 
present life. Then to Us is your return, and 
We will inform you of what you used to do.
24. The likeness of the present life is this: water 
that We send down from the sky is absorbed 
by the plants of the earth, from which the 
people and the animals eat. Until, when the 
earth puts on its fine appearance, and is beau￾tified, and its inhabitants think that they have 
74
10. JONAH (Yunus)
mastered it, Our command descends upon it 
by night or by day, and We turn it into stub￾ble, as if it had not flourished the day before. 
We thus clarify the revelations for people 
who reflect.
25. Allah invites to the Home of Peace, and 
guides whomever He wills to a straight path.
26. For those who have done good is goodness, 
and more. Neither gloom nor shame will 
come over their faces. These are the inhabit￾ants of Paradise, abiding therein forever.
27. As for those who have earned evil deeds: a 
reward of similar evil, and shame will cover 
them. They will have no defense against Al￾lah—as if their faces are covered with dark 
patches of night. These are the inmates of the 
Fire, abiding therein forever.
28. On the Day when We will gather them al￾together, then say to those who ascribed part￾ners, “To your place, you and your partners.” 
Then We will separate between them, and 
their partners will say, “It was not us you were 
worshiping.”
29. “Allah is sufficient witness between us and 
you. We were unaware of your worshiping 
us.”
30. There, every soul will experience what it 
had done previously; and they will be re￾turned to Allah, their True Master; and what 
they used to invent will fail them.
31. Say, “Who provides for you from the 
heaven and the earth? And who controls the 
hearing and the sight? And who produces the 
living from the dead, and produces the dead 
from the living? And who governs the Or￾der?” They will say, “Allah.” Say, “Will you 
not be careful?”
32. Such is Allah, your Lord—the True. What 
is there, beyond the truth, except falsehood? 
How are you turned away?
33. Thus your Lord’s Word proved true 
against those who disobeyed, for they do not 
believe.
34. Say, “Can any of your partners initiate cre￾ation, and then repeat it?” Say, “Allah initi￾ates creation, and then repeats it. How are 
you so deluded?”
35. Say, “Can any of your partners guide to the 
truth?” Say, “Allah guides to the truth. Is He 
who guides to the truth more worthy of being 
followed, or he who does not guide, unless he 
himself is guided? What is the matter with 
you? How do you judge?”
36. Most of them follow nothing but assump￾tions; and assumptions avail nothing against 
the truth. Allah is fully aware of what they do.
37. This Quran could not have been produced 
by anyone other than Allah. In fact, it is a 
confirmation of what preceded it, and an 
elaboration of the Book. There is no doubt
about it—it is from the Lord of the Universe.
38. Or do they say, “He has forged it”? Say, 
“Then produce a single chapter like it, and 
call upon whomever you can, apart from Al￾lah, if you are truthful.”
39. In fact, they deny what is beyond the limits 
of their knowledge, and whose explanation 
has not yet reached them. Thus those before 
them refused to believe. So note the conse￾quences for the wrongdoers.
40. Among them are those who believe in it, 
and among them are those who do not be￾lieve in it. Your Lord is fully aware of the mis￾chief-makers.
41. If they accuse you of lying, say, “I have my 
deeds, and you have your deeds. You are quit 
of what I do, and I am quit of what you do.”
42. And among them are those who listen to 
you. But can you make the deaf hear, even 
though they do not understand?
43. And among them are those who look at 
you. But can you guide the blind, even 
though they do not see?
44. Allah does not wrong the people in the 
least, but the people wrong their own selves.
45. On the Day when He rounds them up—as 
if they had tarried only one hour of a day—
they will recognize one another. Those who 
75
10. JONAH (Yunus)
denied the meeting with Allah will be the los￾ers. They were not guided.
46. Whether We show you some of what We 
promise them, or take you, to Us is their re￾turn. Allah is witness to everything they do.
47. Every community has a messenger. When 
their messenger has come, judgment will be 
passed between them with fairness, and they 
will not be wronged.
48. And they say, “When will this promise be 
fulfilled, if you are truthful?”
49. Say, “I have no power to harm or benefit 
myself, except as Allah wills. To every nation 
is an appointed time. Then, when their time 
arrives, they can neither postpone it by one 
hour, nor advance it.
50. Say, “Have you considered? If His punish￾ment overtakes you by night or by day, what 
part of it will the guilty seek to hasten?”
51. “Then, when it falls, will you believe in it? 
Now? When before you tried to hasten it?”
52. Then it will be said to those who did wrong, 
“Taste the torment of eternity. Will you be re￾warded except for what you used to do?”
53. And they inquire of you, “Is it true?” Say, 
“Yes, by my Lord, it is true, and you cannot 
evade it.”
54. Had every soul which had done wrong pos￾sessed everything on earth, it would offer it as 
a ransom. They will hide the remorse when 
they witness the suffering, and it will be 
judged between them equitably, and they will 
not be wronged.
55. Assuredly, to Allah belongs everything in 
the heavens and the earth. Assuredly, the 
promise of Allah is true. But most of them do 
not know.
56. He gives life and causes death, and to Him 
you will be returned.
57. O people! There has come to you advice 
from your Lord, and healing for what is in the 
hearts, and guidance and mercy for the be￾lievers.
58. Say, “In Allah’s grace and mercy let them 
rejoice. That is better than what they hoard.”
59. Say, “Have you considered the sustenance 
Allah has sent down for you, some of which 
you made unlawful, and some lawful?” Say, 
“Did Allah give you permission, or do you 
fabricate lies and attribute them to Allah?”
60. What will they think—those who fabricate 
lies and attribute them to Allah—on the Day 
of Resurrection? Allah is bountiful towards 
the people, but most of them do not give 
thanks.
61. You do not get into any situation, nor do 
you recite any Quran, nor do you do any￾thing, but We are watching over you as you 
undertake it. Not even the weight of an atom, 
on earth or in the sky, escapes your Lord, nor 
is there anything smaller or larger, but is in a 
clear record.
62. Unquestionably, Allah’s friends have noth￾ing to fear, nor shall they grieve.
63. Those who believe and are aware.
64. For them is good news in this life, and in 
the Hereafter. There is no alteration to the 
words of Allah. That is the supreme triumph.
65. And let not their sayings dishearten you. 
All power is Allah’s. He is the Hearer, the 
Knower.
66. Certainly, to Allah belongs everyone in the 
heavens and everyone on earth. Those who 
invoke other than Allah do not follow part￾ners; they follow only assumptions, and they 
only guess.
67. It is He who made the night for your rest, 
and the daylight for visibility. Surely in that 
are signs for people who listen.
68. And they said, “Allah has taken a son.” Be 
He glorified. He is the Self-Sufficient. His is 
everything in the heavens and everything on 
earth. Do you have any proof for this? Or are 
you saying about Allah what you do not 
know?
69. Say, “Those who fabricate lies about Allah 
will not succeed.”
76
10. JONAH (Yunus)
70. Some enjoyment in this world; then to Us 
is their return; then We will make them taste 
the severe punishment on account of their 
disbelief.
71. And relate to them the story of Noah, when 
he said to his people, “O my people, if my 
presence among you and my reminding you 
of Allah’s signs is too much for you, then in 
Allah I have put my trust. So come to a deci￾sion, you and your partners, and do not let 
the matter perplex you; then carry out your 
decision on me, and do not hold back.”
72. “But if you turn away, I have not asked you 
for any wage. My wage falls only on Allah, 
and I was commanded to be of those who 
submit.”
73. But they denounced him, so We saved him 
and those with him in the Ark, and We made 
them successors, and We drowned those who 
rejected Our signs. So consider the fate of 
those who were warned.
74. Then, after him, We sent messengers to 
their people. They came to them with the 
clear proofs, but they would not believe in an￾ything they had already rejected. Thus We set 
a seal on the hearts of the hostile.
75. Then, after them, We sent Moses and Aa￾ron with Our proofs to Pharaoh and his dig￾nitaries. But they acted arrogantly. They were 
sinful people.
76. And when the truth came to them from Us, 
they said, “This is clearly sorcery.”
77. Moses said, “Is this what you say of the 
truth when it has come to you? Is this sor￾cery? Sorcerers do not succeed.”
78. They said, “Did you come to us to divert us 
from what we found our ancestors following, 
and so that you become prominent in the 
land? We will never believe in you.”
79. Pharaoh said, “Bring me every experienced 
sorcerer.”
80. And when the sorcerers came, Moses said 
to them, “Throw whatever you have to 
throw.”
81. And when they threw, Moses said, “What 
you produced is sorcery, and Allah will make 
it fail. Allah does not foster the efforts of the
corrupt.”
82. “And Allah upholds the truth with His 
words, even though the sinners detest it.”
83. But none believed in Moses except some 
children of his people, for fear that Pharaoh 
and his chiefs would persecute them. Phar￾aoh was high and mighty in the land. He was 
a tyrant.
84. Moses said, “O my people, if you have be￾lieved in Allah, then put your trust in Him, if 
you have submitted.”
85. They said, “In Allah we have put our trust. 
Our Lord, do not make us victims of the op￾pressive people.”
86. “And deliver us, by Your mercy, from the 
disbelieving people.”
87. And We inspired Moses and his brother, 
“Settle your people in Egypt, and make your 
homes places of worship, and perform the 
prayer, and give good news to the believers.”
88. Moses said, “Our Lord, you have given 
Pharaoh and his chiefs splendor and wealth 
in the worldly life. Our Lord, for them to lead 
away from Your path. Our Lord, obliterate 
their wealth, and harden their hearts, they 
will not believe until they see the painful tor￾ment.”
89. He said, “Your prayer has been answered, 
so go straight, and do not follow the path of 
those who do not know.”
90. And We delivered the Children of Israel 
across the sea. Pharaoh and his troops pur￾sued them, defiantly and aggressively. Until, 
when he was about to drown, he said, “I be￾lieve that there is no god except the One the 
Children of Israel believe in, and I am of 
those who submit.”
91. Now? When you have rebelled before, and 
been of the mischief-makers?
92. Today We will preserve your body, so that 
you become a sign for those after you. But 
most people are heedless of Our signs.
77
11. HUD (Hud)
93. And We settled the Children of Israel in a 
position of honor, and provided them with 
good things. They did not differ until 
knowledge came to them. Your Lord will 
judge between them on the Day of Resurrec￾tion regarding their differences.
94. If you are in doubt about what We revealed 
to you, ask those who read the Scripture be￾fore you. The truth has come to you from 
your Lord, so do not be of those who doubt.
95. And do not be of those who deny Allah’s 
revelations, lest you become one of the losers.
96. Those against whom your Lord’s Word is 
justified will not believe.
97. Even if every sign comes to them—until 
they see the painful punishment.
98. If only there was one town that believed 
and benefited by its belief. Except for the peo￾ple of Jonah. When they believed, We re￾moved from them the suffering of disgrace in 
the worldly life, and We gave them comfort 
for a while.
99. Had your Lord willed, everyone on earth 
would have believed. Will you compel people 
to become believers?
100. No soul can believe except by Allah’s 
leave; and He lays disgrace upon those who 
refuse to understand.
101. Say, “Look at what is in the heavens and 
the earth.” But signs and warnings are of no 
avail for people who do not believe.
102. Do they expect anything but the likes of 
the days of those who passed away before 
them? Say, “Then wait, I will be waiting with 
you.”
103. Then We save Our messengers and those 
who believe. It is binding on Us to save the
believers.
104. Say, “O people, if you are in doubt about 
my religion—I do not serve those you serve 
apart from Allah. But I serve Allah, the one 
who will terminate your lives. And I was 
commanded to be of the believers.”
105. And dedicate yourself to the true reli￾gion—a monotheist—and never be of the 
polytheists.
106. And do not call, apart from Allah, on what 
neither benefits you nor harms you. If you 
do, you are then one of the wrongdoers.
107. If Allah afflicts you with harm, none can 
remove it except He. And if He wants good 
for you, none can repel His grace. He makes 
it reach whomever He wills of His servants. 
He is the Forgiver, the Merciful.
108. Say, “O people, the truth has come to you 
from your Lord. Whoever accepts guidance is 
guided for his own soul; and whoever strays 
only strays to its detriment. I am not a guard￾ian over you.”
109. And follow what is revealed to you, and be 
patient until Allah issues His judgment, for 
He is the Best of judges.
11. HUD
(Hud)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Alif, Lam, Ra. A Scripture whose Verses 
were perfected, then elaborated, from One 
who is Wise and Informed.
2. That you shall worship none but Allah. “I 
am a warner to you from Him, and a bearer 
of good news.”
3. “And ask your Lord for forgiveness, and re￾pent to Him. He will provide you with good 
sustenance until a stated term, and will be￾stow His grace on every possessor of virtue. 
But if you turn away, then I fear for you the 
punishment of a grievous Day.”
4. “To Allah is your return, and He is Capable 
of all things.”
5. They wrap their chests to hide from Him. 
But even as they cover themselves with their 
clothes, He knows what they conceal and 
what they reveal. He knows what lies within 
the hearts.
78
11. HUD (Hud)
6. There is no moving creature on earth but its 
sustenance depends on Allah. And He knows 
where it lives and where it rests. Everything is 
in a Clear Book.
7. It is He who created the heavens and the 
earth in six days—and His Throne was upon 
the waters—in order to test you—which of 
you is best in conduct. And if you were to say, 
“You will be resurrected after death,” those 
who disbelieve would say, “This is nothing 
but plain witchcraft.”
8. And if We postponed their punishment un￾til a stated time, they would say, “What holds 
it back?” On the Day when it reaches them, it 
will not be averted from them, and what they 
used to ridicule will besiege them.
9. If We give the human being a taste of mercy 
from Us, and then withdraw it from him, he 
becomes despairing and ungrateful.
10. And if We give him a taste of prosperity, 
after some adversity has afflicted him, he will 
say, “Troubles have gone away from me.” He 
becomes excited and proud.
11. Except those who are patient and do good 
deeds—these will have forgiveness and a 
great reward.
12. Perhaps you wish to disregard some of 
what is revealed to you, and you may be 
stressed because of it, since they say, “If only 
a treasure was sent down to him, or an angel 
came with him.” You are only a warner, and 
Allah is Responsible for all things.
13. Or do they say, “He invented it?” Say, 
“Then produce ten chapters like it, invented, 
and call upon whomever you can, besides Al￾lah, if you are truthful.”
14. But if they fail to answer you, know that it 
was revealed with Allah’s knowledge, and 
that there is no god but He. Will you then 
submit?
15. Whoever desires the worldly life and its 
glitter—We will fully recompense them for 
their deeds therein, and therein they will not 
be defrauded.
16. These—they will have nothing but the Fire 
in the Hereafter. Their deeds are in vain 
therein, and their works are null.
17. Is he who possesses a clear proof from his 
Lord, recited by a witness from Him, and be￾fore it the Book of Moses, a guide and a 
mercy? These believe in it. But whoever defies 
it from among the various factions, the Fire is 
his promise. So have no doubt about it. It is 
the truth from your Lord, but most people do 
not believe.
18. Who does greater wrong than he who fab￾ricates lies about Allah? These will be pre￾sented before their Lord, and the witnesses 
will say, “These are they who lied about their 
Lord.” Indeed, the curse of Allah is upon the 
wrongdoers.
19. Those who hinder others from the path of 
Allah, and seek to make it crooked; and re￾garding the Hereafter, they are in denial.
20. These will not escape on earth, and they 
have no protectors besides Allah. The pun￾ishment will be doubled for them. They have 
failed to hear, and they have failed to see.
21. Those are the ones who lost their souls, and 
what they had invented has strayed away 
from them.
22. Without a doubt, in the Hereafter, they will 
be the biggest losers.
23. As for those who believe and do good 
deeds, and humble themselves before their 
Lord—these are the inhabitants of Paradise, 
where they will abide forever.
24. The parable of the two groups is that of the 
blind and the deaf, and the seeing and the 
hearing. Are they equal in comparison? Will 
you not reflect?
25. We sent Noah to his people, “I am to you a 
clear warner.”
26. “That you shall worship none but Allah. I 
fear for you the agony of a painful Day.”
27. The notables who disbelieved among his 
people said, “We see in you nothing but a 
man like us, and we see that only the worst 
79
11. HUD (Hud)
among us have followed you, those of imma￾ture judgment. And we see that you have no 
advantage over us. In fact, we think you are 
liars.”
28. He said, “O my people, Have you consid￾ered? If I stand on clear evidence from my 
Lord, and He has given me a mercy from 
Himself, but you were blind to it, can we 
compel you to accept it, even though you dis￾like it?”
29. “O my people! I ask of you no money for it. 
My reward lies only with Allah. And I am not 
about to dismiss those who believed; they will 
surely meet their Lord. And I see that you are 
ignorant people.”
30. “O my people! Who will support me 
against Allah, if I dismiss them? Will you not 
give a thought?”
31. “I do not say to you that I possess the treas￾ures of Allah, nor do I know the future, nor 
do I say that I am an angel. Nor do I say of 
those who are despicable in your eyes that Al￾lah will never give them any good. Allah is 
Aware of what lies in their souls. If I did, I 
would be one of the wrongdoers.”
32. They said, “O Noah, you have argued with 
us, and argued a great deal. Now bring upon 
us what you threaten us with, if you are truth￾ful.”
33. He said, “It is Allah who will bring it upon 
you, if He wills, and you will not be able to 
escape.”
34. “My advice will not benefit you, much as I 
may want to advise you, if Allah desires to 
confound you. He is your Lord, and to Him 
you will be returned.”
35. Or do they say, “He made it up?” Say, “If I 
made it up, upon me falls my crime, and I am 
innocent of the crimes you commit.”
36. And it was revealed to Noah: “None of 
your people will believe, except those who 
have already believed, so do not grieve over
what they do.”
37. “And build the Ark, under Our eyes, and 
with Our inspiration, and do not address Me 
regarding those who did wrong; they are to 
be drowned.”
38. As he was building the ark, whenever some 
of his people passed by him, they ridiculed 
him. He said, “If you ridicule us, we will ridi￾cule you, just as you ridicule.”
39. “You will surely know upon whom will 
come a torment that will abase him, and upon 
whom will fall a lasting torment.”
40. Until, when Our command came, and the 
volcano erupted, We said, “Board into it a 
pair of every kind, and your family—except 
those against whom the sentence has already 
been passed—and those who have believed.” 
But those who believed with him were only a 
few.
41. He said, “Embark in it. In the name of Al￾lah shall be its sailing and its anchorage. My 
Lord is indeed Forgiving and Merciful.”
42. And so it sailed with them amidst waves 
like hills. And Noah called to his son, who 
had kept away, “O my son! Embark with us, 
and do not be with the disbelievers.”
43. He said, “I will take refuge on a moun￾tain—it will protect me from the water.” He 
said, “There is no protection from Allah’s de￾cree today, except for him on whom He has 
mercy.” And the waves surged between them, 
and he was among the drowned.
44. And it was said,“O earth, swallow your wa￾ters,” and “O heaven, clear up.” And the wa￾ters receded, and the event was concluded, 
and it settled on Judi, and it was proclaimed: 
“Away with the wicked people.”
45. And Noah called to his Lord. He said, “O 
My Lord, my son is of my family, and Your 
promise is true, and You are the Wisest of the 
wise.”
46. He said, “O Noah, he is not of your family. 
It is an unrighteous deed. So do not ask Me 
about something you know nothing about. I 
admonish you, lest you be one of the igno￾rant.”
47. He said, “O My Lord, I seek refuge with 
You, from asking You about what I have no 
80
11. HUD (Hud)
knowledge of. Unless You forgive me, and 
have mercy on me, I will be one of the losers.”
48. It was said, “O Noah, disembark with peace 
from Us; and with blessings upon you, and 
upon communities from those with you. And 
other communities We will grant prosperity, 
and then a painful torment from Us will be￾fall them.”
49. These are some stories from the past that 
we reveal to you. Neither you, nor your peo￾ple knew them before this. So be patient. The 
future belongs to the pious.
50. And to Aad, their brother Hud. He said, “O 
my people, worship Allah, you have no other 
god besides Him. You do nothing but invent 
lies.”
51. “O my people, I ask you no wage for it; my 
wage lies with Him who originated me. Do 
you not understand?”
52. “O my people, ask forgiveness from your 
Lord, and repent to Him. He will release the 
sky pouring down upon you, and will add 
strength to your strength. And do not turn 
away and be wicked.”
53. They said, “O Hud, you did not bring us 
any evidence, and we are not about to aban￾don our gods at your word, and we are not 
believers in you.”
54. “We only say that some of our gods have 
possessed you with evil.” He said, “I call Allah 
to witness, and you to witness, that I am in￾nocent of what you associate.
55. Besides Him. So scheme against me, all of 
you, and do not hesitate.
56. I have placed my trust in Allah, my Lord 
and your Lord. There is not a creature but He 
holds it by the forelock. My Lord is on a 
straight path.
57. If you turn away, I have conveyed to you 
what I was sent to you with; and my Lord will 
replace you with another people, and you will 
not cause Him any harm. My Lord is Guard￾ian over all things.”
58. And when Our decree came, We saved 
Hud and those who believed with him, by a 
mercy from Us, and We delivered them from 
a harsh punishment.
59. That was Aad; they denied the signs of 
their Lord, and defied His messengers, and 
followed the lead of every stubborn tyrant.
60. And they were pursued by a curse in this 
world, and on the Day of Resurrection. In￾deed, Aad blasphemed against their Lord—so 
away with Aad, the people of Hud.
61. And to Thamood, their brother Saleh. He 
said, “O my people, worship Allah, you have 
no god other than Him. He initiated you 
from the earth, and settled you in it. So seek 
His forgiveness, and repent to Him. My Lord 
is Near and Responsive.”
62. They said, “O Saleh, we had hopes in you 
before this. Are you trying to prevent us from 
worshiping what our parents worship? We 
are in serious doubt regarding what you are 
calling us to.”
63. He said, “O my people, have you consid￾ered? If I stand upon clear evidence from my 
Lord, and He has given me mercy from Him, 
who would protect me from Allah, if I diso￾beyed Him? You add nothing for me except 
loss.”
64. “O my people, this is the she-camel of Al￾lah, a sign for you. Let her graze on Allah’s 
land, and do not harm her, lest an imminent 
punishment overtakes you.”
65. But they hamstrung her, and so He said, 
“Enjoy yourselves in your homes for three 
days. This is a prophecy that is infallible.”
66. Then, when Our command came, We 
saved Saleh and those who believed with him, 
by a mercy from Us, from the disgrace of that 
day. Your Lord is the Strong, the Mighty.
67. And the Scream struck those who trans￾gressed, and they became motionless bodies 
in their homes.
68. As if they had never prospered therein. In￾deed, Thamood rejected their Lord, so away 
with Thamood.
69. Our messengers came to Abraham with 
good news. They said, “Peace.” He said,
81
11. HUD (Hud)
“Peace.” Soon after, he came with a roasted 
calf.
70. But when he saw their hands not reaching 
towards it, he became suspicious of them, 
and conceived a fear of them. They said, “Do 
not fear, we were sent to the people of Lot.”
71. His wife was standing by, so she laughed. 
And We gave her good news of Isaac; and af￾ter Isaac, Jacob.
72. She said, “Alas for me. Shall I give birth, 
when I am an old woman, and this, my hus￾band, is an old man? This is truly a strange 
thing.” 
73. They said, “Do you marvel at the decree of 
Allah? The mercy and blessings of Allah are 
upon you, O people of the house. He is 
Praiseworthy and Glorious.”
74. When Abraham's fear subsided, and the 
good news had reached him, he started plead￾ing with Us concerning the people of Lot.
75. Abraham was gentle, kind, penitent.
76. “O Abraham, refrain from this. The com￾mand of your Lord has come; they have in￾curred an irreversible punishment.”
77. And when Our envoys came to Lot, he was 
anxious for them, and concerned for them. 
He said, “This is a dreadful day.”
78. And his people came rushing towards 
him—they were in the habit of committing 
sins. He said, “O my people, these are my 
daughters; they are purer for you. So fear Al￾lah, and do not embarrass me before my 
guests. Is there not one reasonable man 
among you?”
79. They said, “You know well that we have no 
right to your daughters, and you know well 
what we want.”
80. He said, “If only I had the strength to stop 
you, or could rely on some strong support.”
81. They said, “O Lot, we are the envoys of 
your Lord; they will not reach you. So set out 
with your family during the cover of the 
night, and let none of you look back, except 
for your wife. She will be struck by what will 
strike them. Their appointed time is the 
morning. Is not the morning near?”
82. And when Our command came about, We 
turned it upside down, and We rained down 
on it stones of baked clay.
83. Marked from your Lord, and never far 
from the wrongdoers.
84. And to Median, their brother Shuaib. He 
said, “O my people, worship Allah; you have 
no god other than Him. And do not short 
measure or short weight. I see you in good 
circumstances, but I fear for you the agony of 
an encompassing Day.”
85. “O my people! Give full measure and full 
weight, in all fairness, and do not cheat the 
people out of their rights, and do not spread 
corruption in the land.
86. What is left by Allah is best for you, if you 
are believers. And I am not a guardian over 
you.”
87. They said, “O Shuaib, does your prayer 
command you that we abandon what our an￾cestors worshiped, or doing with our wealth 
what we want? You are the one who is intel￾ligent and wise.”
88. He said, “O my people, have you consid￾ered? What if I have clear evidence from my 
Lord, and He has given me good livelihood 
from Himself? I have no desire to do what I 
forbid you from doing. I desire nothing but 
reform, as far as I can. My success lies only 
with Allah. In Him I trust, and to Him I 
turn.”
89. “O my people, let not your hostility to￾wards me cause you to suffer what was suf￾fered by the people of Noah, or the people of 
Hud, or the people of Saleh. The people of Lot 
are not far away from you.”
90. “And ask your Lord for forgiveness, and re￾pent to Him. My Lord is Merciful and Lov￾ing.”
91. They said, “O Shuaib, we do not under￾stand much of what you say, and we see that 
you are weak among us. Were it not for your 
82
11. HUD (Hud)
tribe, we would have stoned you. You are of 
no value to us.”
92. He said, “O my people, is my tribe more 
important to you than Allah? And you have 
turned your backs on Him? My Lord com￾prehends everything you do.”
93. “O my people, do as you may, and so will I. 
You will know to whom will come a punish￾ment that will shame him, and who is a liar. 
So look out; I am on the lookout with you.”
94. And when Our command came, We saved 
Shuaib and those who believed with him, by 
mercy from Us, and the Blast struck the 
wrongdoers, and they became motionless 
bodies in their homes.
95. As though they never flourished therein. 
Away with Median, as was done away with 
Thamood.
96. And We sent Moses with Our signs and a 
clear mandate.
97. To Pharaoh and his nobles, but they fol￾lowed the command of Pharaoh, and the 
command of Pharaoh was not wise.
98. He will precede his people on the Day of 
Resurrection, and will lead them into the 
Fire. Miserable is the place he placed them in.
99. They were followed by a curse in this, and 
on the Day of Resurrection. Miserable is the 
path they followed.
100. These are of the reports of the towns—We 
relate them to you. Some are still standing, 
and some have withered away.
101.We did not wrong them, but they wronged 
themselves. Their gods, whom they invoked 
besides Allah, availed them nothing when the 
command of your Lord arrived. In fact, they 
added only to their ruin.
102. Such is the grip of your Lord when He 
seizes the towns in the midst of their sins. His 
grip is most painful, most severe.
103. In that is a sign for whoever fears the pun￾ishment of the Hereafter. That is a Day for 
which humanity will be gathered together—
that is a Day to be witnessed.
104. We only postpone it until a predetermined 
time.
105. On the Day when it arrives, no soul will 
speak without His permission. Some will be 
miserable, and some will be happy.
106. As for those who are miserable, they will 
be in the Fire. They will have therein sighing 
and wailing.
107. Remaining therein for as long as the heav￾ens and the earth endure, except as your Lord 
wills. Your Lord is Doer of whatever He wills.
108. And as for those who are happy, they will 
be in Paradise, remaining therein for as long 
as the heavens and the earth endure, except 
as your Lord wills—a reward without end.
109. So be not in doubt regarding what these 
people worship. They worship only as their 
ancestors worshiped before. We will pay 
them their due in full, without any reduction.
110. We gave Moses the Scripture, but it was 
disputed. Were it not for a prior word from 
your Lord, it would have been settled be￾tween them. They are in serious doubt con￾cerning it.
111. Your Lord will repay each one of them in 
full for their deeds. He is Aware of everything 
they do.
112. So be upright, as you are commanded, 
along with those who repented with you, and 
do not transgress. He is Seeing of everything 
you do.
113. And do not incline towards those who do 
wrong, or the Fire may touch you; and you 
will have no protectors besides Allah, and 
you will not be saved.
114. Perform the prayer at the borders of the 
day, and during the approaches of the night. 
The good deeds take away the bad deeds. This 
is a reminder for those who remember.
115. And be patient. Allah will not waste the re￾ward of the virtuous.
116. If only there were, among the generations 
before you, people with wisdom, who spoke 
against corruption on earth—except for the 
few whom We saved. But the wrongdoers 
83
12. JOSEPH (Yusuf)
pursued the luxuries they were indulged in, 
and thus became guilty.
117. Your Lord would never destroy the towns 
wrongfully, while their inhabitants are right￾eous. 
118. Had your Lord willed, He could have 
made humanity one community, but they 
continue to differ.
119. Except those on whom your Lord has
mercy—for that reason He created them. The 
Word of your Lord is final: “I will fill Hell 
with jinn and humans, altogether.”
120. Everything We narrate to you of the his￾tory of the messengers is to strengthen your 
heart therewith. The truth has come to you in 
this, and a lesson, and a reminder for the be￾lievers.
121. And say to those who do not believe, “Act 
according to your ability; and so will we.”
122. “And wait; we too are waiting.”
123. To Allah belongs the future of the heavens 
and the earth, and to Him all authority goes 
back. So worship Him, and rely on Him. 
Your Lord is never unaware of what you do.
12. JOSEPH
(Yusuf)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Alif, Lam, Ra. These are the Verses of the 
Clear Book.
2. We have revealed it an Arabic Quran, so 
that you may understand.
3. We narrate to you the most accurate his￾tory, by revealing to you this Quran. Alt￾hough, prior to it, you were of the unaware.
4. When Joseph said to his father, “O my fa￾ther, I saw eleven planets, and the sun, and 
the moon; I saw them bowing down to me.”
5. He said, “O my son, do not relate your vi￾sion to your brothers, lest they plot and 
scheme against you. Satan is man's sworn en￾emy.
6. And thus your Lord will choose you, and 
will teach you the interpretation of events, 
and will complete His blessing upon you and 
upon the family of Jacob, as He has com￾pleted it before upon your forefathers Abra￾ham and Isaac. Your Lord is Knowing and 
Wise.
7. In Joseph and his brothers are lessons for 
the seekers.
8. When they said, “Joseph and his brother are 
dearer to our father than we are, although we 
are a whole group. Our father is obviously in 
the wrong.
9. “Kill Joseph, or throw him somewhere in 
the land, and your father‘s attention will be 
yours. Afterwards, you will be decent peo￾ple.”
10. One of them said, “Do not kill Joseph, but 
throw him into the bottom of the well; some 
caravan may pick him up—if you must do 
something.”
11. They said, “Father, why do you not trust us 
with Joseph, although we care for him?”
12. “Send him with us tomorrow, that he may 
roam and play; we will take care of him.”
13. He said, “It worries me that you would take 
him away. And I fear the wolf may eat him 
while you are careless of him.”
14. They said, “If the wolf ate him, and we are 
many, we would be good for nothing.”
15. So they went away with him, and agreed to 
put him at the bottom of the well. And We 
inspired him, “You will inform them of this 
deed of theirs when they are unaware.”
16. And they came to their father in the even￾ing weeping.
17. They said, “O father, we went off racing 
one another, and left Joseph by our belong￾ings; and the wolf ate him. But you will not 
believe us, even though we are being truth￾ful.”
18. And they brought his shirt, with fake blood 
on it. He said, “Your souls enticed you to do 
something. But patience is beautiful, and Al￾lah is my Help against what you describe.”
84
12. JOSEPH (Yusuf)
19. A caravan passed by, and they sent their 
water-carrier. He lowered his bucket, and 
said, “Good news. Here is a boy.” And they 
hid him as merchandise. But Allah was aware 
of what they did.
20. And they sold him for a cheap price—a few 
coins—they considered him to be of little 
value.
21. The Egyptian who bought him said to his 
wife, “Take good care of him; he may be use￾ful to us, or we may adopt him as a son.” We 
thus established Joseph in the land, to teach 
him the interpretation of events. Allah has 
control over His affairs, but most people do 
not know.
22. When he reached his maturity, We gave 
him wisdom and knowledge. We thus reward 
the righteous.
23. She in whose house he was living tried to 
seduce him. She shut the doors, and said, “I 
am yours.” He said, “Allah forbid! He is my 
Lord. He has given me a good home. Sinners 
never succeed.”
24. She desired him, and he desired her, had he 
not seen the proof of his Lord. It was thus that 
We diverted evil and indecency away from 
him. He was one of Our loyal servants.
25. As they raced towards the door, she tore his 
shirt from behind. At the door, they ran into 
her husband. She said, “What is the penalty 
for him who desired to dishonor your wife, 
except imprisonment or a painful punish￾ment?”
26. He said, “It was she who tried to seduce 
me.” A witness from her household sug￾gested: “If his shirt is torn from the front: 
then she has told the truth, and he is the liar.
27. But if his shirt is torn from the back: then 
she has lied, and he is the truthful.”
28. And when he saw that his shirt was torn 
from the back, he said, “This is a woman's 
scheme. Your scheming is serious indeed.”
29. “Joseph, turn away from this. And you, 
woman, ask forgiveness for your sin; you are 
indeed in the wrong.”
30. Some ladies in the city said, “The gover￾nor's wife is trying to seduce her servant. She 
is deeply in love with him. We see she has 
gone astray.”
31. And when she heard of their gossip, she in￾vited them, and prepared for them a banquet, 
and she gave each one of them a knife. She 
said, “Come out before them.” And when 
they saw him, they marveled at him, and cut 
their hands. They said, “Good Allah, this is 
not a human, this must be a precious angel.”
32. She said, “Here he is, the one you blamed 
me for. I did try to seduce him, but he re￾sisted. But if he does not do what I tell him to 
do, he will be imprisoned, and will be one of 
the despised.”
33. He said, “My Lord, prison is more desira￾ble to me than what they call me to. Unless 
You turn their scheming away from me, I 
may yield to them, and become one of the ig￾norant.”
34. Thereupon his Lord answered him, and di￾verted their scheming away from him. He is 
the Hearer, the Knower.
35. Then it occurred to them, after they had 
seen the signs, to imprison him for a while.
36. Two youth entered the prison with him. 
One of them said, “I see myself pressing 
wine.” The other said, “I see myself carrying 
bread on my head, from which the birds are 
eating. Tell us their interpretation—we see 
that you are one of the righteous.”
37. He said, “No food is served to you, but I 
have informed you about it before you have 
received it. That is some of what my Lord has 
taught me. I have forsaken the tradition of 
people who do not believe in Allah; and re￾garding the Hereafter, they are deniers.”
38. “And I have followed the faith of my fore￾fathers, Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob. It is 
not for us to associate anything with Allah. 
This is by virtue of Allah’s grace upon us and 
upon the people, but most people do not give 
thanks.
39. “O My fellow inmates, are diverse lords 
better, or Allah, the One, the Supreme?”
85
12. JOSEPH (Yusuf)
40. “You do not worship, besides Him, except 
names you have named, you and your ances￾tors, for which Allah has sent down no au￾thority. Judgment belongs to none but Allah. 
He has commanded that you worship none 
but Him. This is the right religion, but most 
people do not know.
41. “O my fellow inmates! One of you will 
serve his master wine; while the other will be 
crucified, and the birds will eat from his head. 
Thus the matter you are inquiring about is 
settled.”
42. And he said to the one he thought would 
be released, “Mention me to your master.” 
But Satan caused him to forget mentioning 
him to his master, so he remained in prison 
for several years.
43. The king said, “I see seven fat cows being 
eaten by seven lean ones, and seven green 
spikes, and others dried up. O elders, explain 
to me my vision, if you are able to interpret 
visions.”
44. They said, “Jumbles of dreams, and we 
know nothing of the interpretation of 
dreams.”
45. The one who was released said, having re￾membered after a time, “I will inform you of 
its interpretation, so send me out.”
46. “Joseph, O man of truth, inform us con￾cerning seven fat cows being eaten by seven 
lean ones, and seven green spikes, and others 
dried up, so that I may return to the people, 
so that they may know.”
47. He said, “You will farm for seven consecu￾tive years. But whatever you harvest, leave it 
in its spikes, except for the little that you eat.”
48. Then after that will come seven difficult 
ones, which will consume what you have 
stored for them, except for the little that you 
have preserved.
49. Then after that will come a year that brings 
relief to the people, and during which they 
will press.
50. The king said, “Bring him to me.” And 
when the envoy came to him, he said, “Go 
back to your master, and ask him about the 
intentions of the women who cut their hands; 
my Lord is well aware of their schemes.”
51. He said, “What was the matter with you, 
women, when you tried to seduce Joseph?” 
They said, “Allah forbid! We knew of no evil 
committed by him.” The governor’s wife then 
said, “Now the truth is out. It was I who tried 
to seduce him, and he is telling the truth.”
52. “This is that he may know that I did not 
betray him in secret, and that Allah does not 
guide the scheming of the betrayers.”
53. “Yet I do not claim to be innocent. The soul 
commands evil, except those on whom my 
Lord has mercy. Truly my Lord is Forgiving 
and Merciful.”
54. The king said, “Bring him to me, and I will 
reserve him for myself.” And when he spoke 
to him, he said, “This day you are with us es￾tablished and secure.” 
55. He said, “Put me in charge of the store￾houses of the land; I am honest and knowl￾edgeable.”
56. And thus We established Joseph in the 
land, to live therein wherever he wished. We 
touch with Our mercy whomever We will, 
and We never waste the reward of the right￾eous.
57. But the reward of the Hereafter is better for 
those who believe and observed piety.
58. And Joseph's brothers came, and entered 
into his presence. He recognized them, but 
they did not recognize him.
59. When he provided them with their provi￾sions, he said, “Bring me a brother of yours 
from your father. Do you not see that I fill up 
the measure, and I am the best of hosts?”
60. “But if you do not bring him to me, you will 
have no measure from me, and you will not 
come near me.”
61. They said, “We will solicit him from his fa￾ther. We will surely do.”
62. He said to his servants, “Put their goods in 
their saddlebags; perhaps they will recognize 
86
12. JOSEPH (Yusuf)
them when they return to their families, and 
maybe they will come back.”
63. When they returned to their father, they 
said, “O father, we were denied measure, but 
send our brother with us, and we will obtain 
measure. We will take care of him.”
64. He said, “Shall I trust you with him, as I 
trusted you with his brother before? Allah is 
the Best Guardian, and He is the Most Mer￾ciful of the merciful.”
65. And when they opened their baggage, they 
found that their goods were returned to 
them. They said, “Father, what more do we 
want? Here are our goods, returned to us. We 
will provide for our family, and protect our 
brother, and have an additional camel-load. 
This is easy commerce.”
66. He said, “I will not send him with you, un￾less you give me a pledge before Allah that 
you will bring him back to me, unless you get 
trapped.” And when they gave him their 
pledge, he said, “Allah is witness to what we 
say.”
67. And he said, “O my sons, do not enter by 
one gate, but enter by different gates. I cannot 
avail you anything against Allah. The deci￾sion rests only with Allah. On Him I rely, and 
on Him let the reliant rely.”
68. And when they entered as their father had 
instructed them, it did not avail them any￾thing against Allah; it was just a need in the 
soul of Jacob, which he carried out. He was a 
person of knowledge inasmuch as We had 
taught him, but most people do not know.
69. And when they entered into the presence 
of Joseph, he embraced his brother, and said, 
“I am your brother; do not be saddened by 
what they used to do.”
70. Then, when he provided them with their 
provisions, he placed the drinking-cup in his 
brother’s saddlebag. Then an announcer 
called out, “O people of the caravan, you are
thieves.”
71. They said, as they came towards them, 
“What are you missing?”
72. They said, “We are missing the king’s gob￾let. Whoever brings it will have a camel-load; 
and I personally guarantee it.”
73. They said, “By Allah, you know we did not 
come to cause trouble in the land, and we are 
not thieves.”
74. They said, “What shall be his punishment, 
if you are lying?”
75. They said, “His punishment, if it is found 
in his bag: he will belong to you. Thus we pe￾nalize the guilty.”
76. So he began with their bags, before his 
brother's bag. Then he pulled it out of his 
brother’s bag. Thus We devised a plan for Jo￾seph; he could not have detained his brother 
under the king’s law, unless Allah so willed. 
We elevate by degrees whomever We will; 
and above every person of knowledge, there 
is one more learned.
77. They said, “If he has stolen, a brother of his 
has stolen before.” But Joseph kept it to him￾self, and did not reveal it to them. He said, 
“You are in a worse situation, and Allah is 
Aware of what you allege.”
78. They said, “O noble prince, he has a father, 
a very old man, so take one of us in his place. 
We see that you are a good person.”
79. He said, “Allah forbid that we should arrest 
anyone except him in whose possession we 
found our property; for then we would be un￾just.”
80. And when they despaired of him, they con￾ferred privately. Their eldest said, “Don’t you 
know that your father received a pledge from 
you before Allah, and in the past you failed 
with regard to Joseph? I will not leave this 
land until my father permits me, or Allah de￾cides for me; for He is the Best of Deciders.”
81. “Go back to your father, and say, ‘Our fa￾ther, your son has stolen. We testify only to 
what we know, and we could not have pre￾vented the unforeseen.’”
82. “Ask the town where we were, and the car￾avan in which we came. We are being truth￾ful.”
87
12. JOSEPH (Yusuf)
83. He said, “Rather, your souls have contrived 
something for you. Patience is a virtue. Per￾haps Allah will bring them all back to me. He 
is the Knowing, the Wise.”
84. Then he turned away from them, and said, 
“O my bitterness for Joseph.” And his eyes 
turned white from sorrow, and he became 
depressed.
85. They said, “By Allah, you will not stop re￾membering Joseph, until you have ruined 
your health, or you have passed away.”
86. He said, “I only complain of my grief and 
sorrow to Allah, and I know from Allah what 
you do not know.”
87. “O my sons, go and inquire about Joseph 
and his brother, and do not despair of Allah's 
comfort. None despairs of Allah's comfort 
except the disbelieving people.”
88. Then, when they entered into his presence, 
they said, “Mighty governor, adversity has 
befallen us, and our family. We have brought 
scant merchandise. But give us full measure, 
and be charitable towards us—Allah rewards 
the charitable.”
89. He said, “Do you realize what you did with 
Joseph and his brother, in your ignorance?”
90. They said, “Is that you, Joseph?” He said, “I 
am Joseph, and this is my brother. Allah has 
been gracious to us. He who practices piety 
and patience—Allah never fails to reward the 
righteous.”
91. They said, “By Allah, Allah has preferred 
you over us. We were definitely in the 
wrong.”
92. He said, “There is no blame upon you to￾day. Allah will forgive you. He is the Most 
Merciful of the merciful.”
93. “Take this shirt of mine, and lay it over my 
father’s face, and he will recover his sight. 
And bring your whole family to me.”
94. As the caravan set out, their father said, “I 
sense the presence of Joseph, though you may 
think I am senile.”
95. They said, “By Allah, you are still in your 
old confusion.”
96. Then, when the bearer of good news ar￾rived, he laid it over his face, and he regained 
his sight. He said, “Did I not say to you that I 
know from Allah what you do not know?”
97. They said, “Father, pray for the forgiveness 
of our sins; we were indeed at fault.”
98. He said, “I will ask my Lord to forgive you. 
He is the Forgiver, the Most Merciful.”
99. Then, when they entered into the presence 
of Joseph, he embraced his parents, and said, 
“Enter Egypt, Allah willing, safe and secure.”
100. And he elevated his parents on the throne, 
and they fell prostrate before him. He said, 
“Father, this is the fulfillment of my vision of 
long ago. My Lord has made it come true. He 
has blessed me, when he released me from 
prison, and brought you out of the wilder￾ness, after the devil had sown conflict be￾tween me and my brothers. My Lord is Most 
Kind towards whomever He wills. He is the 
All-knowing, the Most Wise.”
101. “My Lord, You have given me some au￾thority, and taught me some interpretation of 
events. Initiator of the heavens and the earth; 
You are my Protector in this life and in the 
Hereafter. Receive my soul in submission, 
and unite me with the righteous.”
102. This is news from the past that We reveal 
to you. You were not present with them when 
they plotted and agreed on a plan.
103. But most people, for all your eagerness, are 
not believers.
104. You ask them no wage for it. It is only a 
reminder for all mankind.
105. How many a sign in the heavens and the 
earth do they pass by, paying no attention to 
them?
106. And most of them do not believe in Allah 
unless they associate others.
107. Do they feel secure that a covering of Al￾lah’s punishment will not come upon them, 
or that the Hour will not come upon them 
suddenly, while they are unaware?
108. Say, “This is my way; I invite to Allah, 
based on clear knowledge—I and whoever 
88
13. THUNDER (ar-Ra’d)
follows me. Glory be to Allah; and I am not 
of the polytheists.”
109. We did not send before you except men, 
whom We inspired, from the people of the 
towns. Have they not roamed the earth and 
seen the consequences for those before them? 
The Home of the Hereafter is better for those 
who are righteous. Do you not understand?
110. Until, when the messengers have des￾paired, and thought that they were rejected, 
Our help came to them. We save whomever 
We will, and Our severity is not averted from 
the guilty people.
111. In their stories is a lesson for those who 
possess intelligence. This is not a fabricated 
tale, but a confirmation of what came before 
it, and a detailed explanation of all things, 
and guidance, and mercy for people who be￾lieve.
13. THUNDER
(ar-Ra’d)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Alif, Lam, Meem, Ra. These are the signs of 
the Scripture. What is revealed to you from 
your Lord is the truth, but most people do not 
believe.
2. Allah is He who raised the heavens without 
pillars that you can see, and then settled on 
the Throne. And He regulated the sun and 
the moon, each running for a specified pe￾riod. He manages all affairs, and He explains 
the signs, that you may be certain of the meet￾ing with your Lord.
3. And it is He who spread the earth, and 
placed in it mountains and rivers. And He 
placed in it two kinds of every fruit. He causes 
the night to overlap the day. In that are signs 
for people who reflect.
4. On earth are adjacent terrains, and gardens 
of vines, and crops, and date-palms, from the 
same root or from distinct roots, irrigated 
with the same water. We make some taste 
better than others. In that are proofs for peo￾ple who reason.
5. Should you wonder—the real wonder is 
their saying: “When we have become dust, 
will we be in a new creation?” Those are they 
who defied their Lord. Those are they who 
will have yokes around their necks. Those are 
the inhabitants of the Fire, where they will re￾main forever.
6. And they urge you to hasten evil before 
good, though examples have passed away be￾fore them. Your Lord is full of forgiveness to￾wards the people for their wrongdoings, yet 
your Lord is severe in retribution.
7. Those who disbelieve say, “Why was a mir￾acle not sent down to him from his Lord?” 
You are only a warner, and to every commu￾nity is a guide.
8. Allah knows what every female bears, and 
every increase and decrease of the wombs. 
With Him, everything is by measure.
9. The Knower of the Invisible and the Visible; 
the Grand, the Supreme.
10. It is the same; whether one of you conceals 
his speech, or declares it; whether he goes 
into hiding by night, or goes out by day.
11. He has a succession; before him and behind 
him, protecting him by Allah’s command. 
Allah does not change the condition of a peo￾ple until they change what is within them￾selves. And if Allah wills any hardship for a 
people, there is no turning it back; and apart 
from Him they have no protector.
12. It is He who shows you the lightening, 
causing fear and hope. And He produces the 
heavy clouds.
13. The thunder praises His glory, and so do 
the angels, in awe of Him. And He sends the 
thunderbolts, striking with them whomever 
He wills. Yet they argue about Allah, while 
He is Tremendous in might.
14. To Him belongs the call to truth. Those 
they call upon besides Him do not respond to 
them with anything—except as someone who 
stretches his hands towards water, so that it 
89
13. THUNDER (ar-Ra’d)
may reach his mouth, but it does not reach it. 
The prayers of the unbelievers are only in 
vain.
15. To Allah prostrates everyone in the heav￾ens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly, as 
do their shadows, in the morning and in the 
evening.
16. Say, “Who is the Lord of the heavens and 
the earth?” Say, “Allah.” Say, “Have you taken 
besides Him protectors, who have no power 
to profit or harm even themselves?” Say, “Are 
the blind and the seeing equal? Or are dark￾ness and light equal? Or have they assigned to 
Allah associates, who created the likes of His 
creation, so that the creations seemed to 
them alike? Say, “Allah is the Creator of all 
things, and He is The One, the Irresistible.”
17. He sends down water from the sky, and riv￾erbeds flow according to their capacity. The 
current carries swelling froth. And from what 
they heat in fire of ornaments or utensils 
comes a similar froth. Thus Allah exemplifies 
truth and falsehood. As for the froth, it is 
swept away, but what benefits the people re￾mains in the ground. Thus Allah presents the 
analogies.
18. For those who respond to their Lord is the 
best. But as for those who do not respond to 
Him, even if they possessed everything on 
earth, and twice as much, they could not re￾deem themselves with it. Those will have the 
worst reckoning; and their home is Hell—a 
miserable destination.
19. Is he who knows that what was revealed to 
your from your Lord is the truth, like him 
who is blind? Only those who reason will re￾member.
20. Those who fulfill the promise to Allah, and 
do not violate the agreement. 
21. And those who join what Allah has com￾manded to be joined, and fear their Lord, and 
dread the dire reckoning.
22. And those who patiently seek the presence 
of their Lord, and pray regularly, and spend 
from Our provisions to them, secretly and 
openly, and repel evil with good. These will 
have the Ultimate Home.
23. Everlasting Gardens, which they will enter, 
along with the righteous among their par￾ents, and their spouses, and their descend￾ants. And the angels will enter upon them 
from every gate.
24. “Peace be upon you, because you endured 
patiently. How excellent is the Final Home.”
25. As for those who violate the promise to Al￾lah, after pledging to keep it, and sever what 
Allah has commanded to be joined, and 
spread corruption on earth—these, the curse 
will be upon them, and they will have the 
Worst Home.
26. Allah dispenses the provisions to whom￾ever He wills, and restricts. And they delight 
in the worldly life; yet the worldly life, com￾pared to the Hereafter, is only enjoyment.
27. Those who disbelieve say, “If only a miracle 
was sent down to him from his Lord.” Say, 
“Allah leads astray whomever He wills, and 
He guides to Himself whoever repents.”
28. Those who believe, and whose hearts find 
comfort in the remembrance of Allah. Surely, 
it is in the remembrance of Allah that hearts 
find comfort.”
29. For those who believe and do righteous 
deeds—for them is happiness and a beautiful 
return.
30. Thus We sent you among a community be￾fore which other communities have passed 
away, that you may recite to them what We 
revealed to you. Yet they deny the Benevolent 
One. Say, “He is my Lord; there is no god but 
He; in Him I trust, and to Him is my repent￾ance.”
31. Even if there were a Quran, by which 
mountains could be set in motion, or by 
which the earth could be shattered, or by 
which the dead could be made to speak. In 
fact, every decision rests with Allah. Did the 
believers not give up and realize that had Al￾lah willed, He would have guided all human￾ity? Disasters will continue to strike those 
who disbelieve, because of their deeds, or
90
14. ABRAHAM (Ibrahim)
they fall near their homes, until Allah’s 
promise comes true. Allah never breaks a 
promise.
32. Messengers before you were ridiculed, but 
I granted the disbelievers respite, and then I 
seized them. What a punishment it was!
33. Is He who is watchful over the deeds of 
every soul? Yet they ascribe associates to Al￾lah. Say, “Name them! Or are you informing 
Him of something on earth He does not 
know, or is it a show of words?” In fact, the 
scheming of those who disbelieve is made to 
appear good to them, and they are averted 
from the path. Whomever Allah misguides 
has no guide.
34. There is for them torment in the worldly 
life, but the torment of the Hereafter is 
harsher. And they have no defender against 
Allah. 
35. The likeness of the Garden promised to the 
righteous: rivers flowing beneath it; its food 
is perpetual, and so is its shade. Such is the 
sequel for those who guard against evil, but 
the sequel of the disbelievers is the Fire.
36. Those to whom We gave the Scripture re￾joice in what was revealed to you, while some 
factions reject parts of it. Say, “I am com￾manded to worship Allah, and to never asso￾ciate anything with Him. To Him I invite, 
and to Him is my return.”
37. Thus We revealed it an Arabic code of law. 
Were you to follow their desires, after the
knowledge that has come to you, you would 
have neither ally nor defender against Allah.
38. We sent messengers before you, and We 
assigned for them wives and offspring. No 
messenger could bring a sign except with the 
permission of Allah. For every era is a scrip￾ture.
39. Allah abolishes whatever He wills, and He 
affirms. With Him is the source of the Scrip￾ture.
40. Whether We show you some of what We 
have promised them, or We cause you to 
die—your duty is to inform, and Ours is the 
reckoning.
41. Do they not see how We deal with the 
earth, diminishing it at its edges? Allah 
judges; and nothing can hold back His judg￾ment. And He is quick to settle accounts.
42. Those before them planned, but the entire 
plan is up to Allah. He knows what every soul 
earns. Those who disbelieve will know to 
whom the Ultimate Home is.
43. Those who disbelieve say, “You are not a 
messenger.” Say, “Allah is a sufficient witness 
between me and you, and whoever has 
knowledge of the Scripture.”
14. ABRAHAM
(Ibrahim)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Alif, Lam, Ra. A Scripture that We revealed 
to you, that you may bring humanity from 
darkness to light—with the permission of 
their Lord—to the path of the Almighty, the 
Praiseworthy.
2. Allah—to whom belongs what is in the 
heavens and the earth. And woe to the disbe￾lievers from a severe torment.
3. Those who prefer the present life to the 
Hereafter, and repel from the path of Allah, 
and seek to make it crooked—these are far 
astray.
4. We never sent any messenger except in the 
language of his people, to make things clear 
for them. Allah leads astray whom He wills, 
and guides whom He wills. He is the Mighty, 
the Wise.
5. We sent Moses with Our signs: “Bring your 
people out of darkness into light, and remind 
them of the Days of Allah.” In that are signs 
for every patient and thankful person.”
6. Moses said to his people, “Remember Al￾lah’s blessings upon you, as He delivered you 
from the people of Pharaoh, who inflicted on 
you terrible suffering, slaughtering your sons 
while sparing your daughters. In that was a 
serious trial from your Lord.”
91
14. ABRAHAM (Ibrahim)
7. And when your Lord proclaimed: “If you 
give thanks, I will grant you increase; but if 
you are ungrateful, My punishment is se￾vere.”
8. And Moses said, “Even if you are ungrate￾ful, together with everyone on earth—Allah is 
in no need, Worthy of Praise.”
9. Has not the story reached you, of those be￾fore you, the people of Noah, and Aad, and 
Thamood—and those after them? None 
knows them except Allah. Their messengers 
came to them with the clear proofs, but they 
tried to silence them, and said, “We reject 
what you are sent with, and we are in serious 
doubt regarding what you are calling us to.”
10. Their messengers said, “Is there any doubt 
about Allah, Maker of the heavens and the 
earth? He calls you to forgive you your sins, 
and to defer you until a stated term.” They 
said, “You are only humans like us; you want 
to turn us away from what our ancestors wor￾shiped; so bring us a clear proof.”
11. Their messengers said to them, “We are 
only humans like you, but Allah favors 
whomever He wills from among His servants. 
We cannot possibly show you any proof, ex￾cept by leave of Allah. In Allah let the faithful 
put their trust.”
12. “And why should we not trust in Allah, 
when He has guided us in our ways? We will 
persevere in the face of your persecution. 
And upon Allah the reliant should rely.”
13. Those who disbelieved said to their mes￾sengers, “We will expel you from our land, 
unless you return to our religion.” And their 
Lord inspired them: “We will destroy the 
wrongdoers.”
14. “And We will settle you in the land after 
them. That is for him who fears My Majesty, 
and fears My threats.”
15. And they prayed for victory, and every 
stubborn tyrant came to disappointment.
16. Beyond him lies Hell, and he will be given 
to drink putrid water.
17. He will guzzle it, but he will not swallow it. 
Death will come at him from every direction, 
but he will not die. And beyond this is relent￾less suffering.
18. The likeness of those who disbelieve in 
their Lord: their works are like ashes, in a 
fierce wind, on a stormy day. They have no 
control over anything they have earned. That 
is the utmost misguidance.
19. Do you not see that Allah created the heav￾ens and the earth with truth? If He wills, He 
can do away with you, and bring a new crea￾tion.
20. And that is not difficult for Allah.
21. They will emerge before Allah, altogether. 
The weak will say to those who were proud, 
“We were your followers, can you protect us 
at all against Allah’s punishment?” They will 
say, “Had Allah guided us, we would have 
guided you. It is the same for us; whether we 
mourn, or are patient; there is no asylum for 
us.”
22. And Satan will say, when the issue is set￾tled, “Allah has promised you the promise of 
truth, and I promised you, but I failed you. I 
had no authority over you, except that I called 
you, and you answered me. So do not blame 
me, but blame yourselves. I cannot come to 
your aid, nor can you come to my aid. I reject 
your associating with me in the past. The 
wrongdoers will have a torment most pain￾ful.”
23. But those who believed and did good deeds 
will be admitted into gardens beneath which 
rivers flow, to remain therein forever, by 
leave of their Lord. Their greeting therein will 
be: “Peace.”
24. Do you not see how Allah presents a para￾ble? A good word is like a good tree—its root 
is firm, and its branches are in the sky.
25. It yields its fruits every season by the will of 
its Lord. Allah presents the parables to the 
people, so that they may reflect. 
26. And the parable of a bad word is that of a 
bad tree—it is uprooted from the ground; it 
has no stability.
92
14. ABRAHAM (Ibrahim)
27. Allah gives firmness to those who believe, 
with the firm word, in this life, and in the 
Hereafter. And Allah leads the wicked astray. 
Allah does whatever He wills.
28. Have you not seen those who exchanged 
the blessing of Allah with blasphemy, and 
landed their people into the house of perdi￾tion?
29. Hell—they will roast in it. What a misera￾ble settlement.
30. And they set up rivals to Allah, in order to 
lead away from His path. Say, “Enjoy your￾selves; your destination is the Fire.”
31. Tell My servants who have believed to per￾form the prayers, and to give from what We 
have given them, secretly and publicly, before 
a Day comes in which there is neither trading 
nor friendship.
32. Allah is He Who created the heavens and 
the earth, and sends down water from the 
sky, and with it produces fruits for your sus￾tenance. And He committed the ships to your 
service, sailing through the sea by His com￾mand, and He committed the rivers to your 
service.
33. And He committed the sun and the moon 
to your service, both continuously pursuing 
their courses, and He committed the night 
and the day to your service.
34. And He has given you something of all 
what you asked. And if you were to count Al￾lah’s blessings, you would not be able to enu￾merate them. The human being is unfair and 
ungrateful.
35. Recall that Abraham said, “O my Lord, 
make this land peaceful, and keep me and my 
sons from worshiping idols.”
36. “My Lord, they have led many people 
astray. Whoever follows me belongs with me; 
and whoever disobeys me—You are Forgiv￾ing and Merciful.
37. “Our Lord, I have settled some of my off￾spring in a valley of no vegetation, by Your 
Sacred House, our Lord, so that they may 
perform the prayers. So make the hearts of 
some people incline towards them, and pro￾vide them with fruits, that they may be thank￾ful.”
38. “Our Lord, You know what we conceal and 
what we reveal. And nothing is hidden from 
Allah, on earth or in the heaven.”
39. “Praise be to Allah, Who has given me, in 
my old age, Ishmael and Isaac. My Lord is the 
Hearer of Prayers.”
40. “My Lord, make me one who performs the 
prayer, and from my offspring. Our Lord, ac￾cept my supplication.”
41. “Our Lord, forgive me, and my parents, 
and the believers, on the Day the Reckoning 
takes place.”
42. Do not ever think that Allah is unaware of 
what the wrongdoers do. He only defers them 
until a Day when the sights stare.
43. Their necks outstretched, their heads up￾raised, their gaze unblinking, their hearts 
void.
44. And warn mankind of the Day when the 
punishment will come upon them, and the 
wicked will say, “Our Lord, defer us for a little 
while, and we will answer Your call and fol￾low the messengers.” Did you not swear be￾fore that there will be no passing away for 
you?
45. And you inhabited the homes of those who 
wronged themselves, and it became clear to 
you how We dealt with them, and We cited 
for you the examples.
46. They planned their plans, but their plans 
are known to Allah, even if their plans can 
eliminate mountains.
47. Do not ever think that Allah will break His 
promise to His messengers. Allah is Strong, 
Able to Avenge.
48. On the Day when the earth is changed into 
another earth, and the heavens, and they will 
emerge before Allah, the One, the Irresistible.
49. On that Day, you will see the sinners bound 
together in chains. 
93
15. THE ROCK (al-Hijr)
50. Their garments made of tar, and the Fire 
covering their faces.
51. That Allah may repay each soul according 
to what it has earned. Allah is Quick in reck￾oning.
52. This is a proclamation for mankind, that 
they may be warned thereby, and know that 
He is One God, and that people of under￾standing may remember.
15. THE ROCK
(al-Hijr)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Alif, Lam, Ra. These are the Verses of the 
Book; a Quran that makes things clear.
2. Perhaps those who disbelieve would like to 
become Muslims. 
3. Leave them to eat, and enjoy, and be lulled 
by hope. They will find out.
4. We have never destroyed a town unless it 
had a set time.
5. No nation can bring its time forward, nor 
can they delay it.
6. And they said, “O you who received the 
message, you are insane.”
7. Why do you not bring us the angels, if you 
are truthful?”
8. We do not send the angels down except 
with reason, and they will not be held back.
9. Surely We revealed the Message, and We 
will surely preserve it. 
10. We sent others before you, to the former 
communities.
11. But no messenger came to them, but they 
ridiculed him.
12. Thus We slip it into the hearts of the guilty.
13. They do not believe in it, though the ways 
of the ancients have passed away.
14. Even if We opened for them a gateway into 
the sky, and they began to ascend through it.
15. They would still say, “Our eyes are halluci￾nating; in fact, we are people bewitched.”
16. We placed constellations in the sky, and 
made them beautiful to the beholders.
17. And We guarded them from every outcast 
devil.
18. Except one who steals a hearing, and is fol￾lowed by a visible projectile.
19. We spread the earth, and placed stabilizers 
in it, and in it We grew all things in proper 
measure.
20. And in it We created livelihoods for you, 
and for those for whom you are not the pro￾viders.
21. There is not a thing but with Us are its 
stores, and We send it down only in precise 
measure.
22. We send the fertilizing winds; and send 
down water from the sky, and give it to you 
to drink, and you are not the ones who store 
it.
23. It is We who give life and cause death, and 
We are the Inheritors.
24. And We know those of you who go for￾ward, and We know those who lag behind.
25. It is your Lord who will gather them to￾gether. He is the Wise, the Knowing.
26. We created the human being from clay, 
from molded mud.
27. And the jinn We created before, from 
piercing fire.
28. Your Lord said to the angels, “I am creating 
a human being from clay, from molded 
mud.”
29. “When I have formed him, and breathed 
into him of My spirit, fall down prostrating 
before him.”
30. So the angels prostrated themselves, all to￾gether.
31. Except for Satan. He refused to be among 
those who prostrated themselves.
94
15. THE ROCK (al-Hijr)
32. He said, “O Satan, what kept you from be￾ing among those who prostrated them￾selves?”
33. He said, “I am not about to prostrate my￾self before a human being, whom You created 
from clay, from molded mud.”
34. He said, “Then get out of here, for you are 
an outcast”.
35. “And the curse will be upon you until the 
Day of Judgment.”
36. He said, “My Lord, reprieve me until the 
Day they are resurrected.”
37. He said, “You are of those reprieved.”
38. “Until the Day of the time appointed.”
39. He said, “My Lord, since You have lured 
me away, I will glamorize for them on earth, 
and I will lure them all away.”
40. “Except for Your sincere servants among 
them.”
41. He said, “This is a right way with Me.”
42. “Over My servants you have no authority, 
except for the sinners who follow you.”
43. And Hell is the meeting-place for them all. 
44. “It has seven doors; for each door is an as￾signed class.”
45. But the righteous will be in gardens with 
springs. 
46. “Enter it in peace and security.”
47. And We will remove all ill-feelings from 
their hearts—brothers and sisters, on 
couches facing one another.
48. No fatigue will ever touch them therein, 
nor will they be asked to leave it.
49. Inform My servants that I am the Forgiver, 
the Merciful.
50. And that My punishment is the painful 
punishment.
51. And inform them of the guests of Abra￾ham. 
52. When they entered upon him, and said, 
“Peace.” He said, “We are wary of you.”
53. They said, “Do not fear; we bring you good 
news of a boy endowed with knowledge.”
54. He said, “Do you bring me good news, 
when old age has overtaken me? What good 
news do you bring?”
55. They said, “We bring you good news in 
truth, so do not despair.”
56. He said, “And who despairs of his Lord’s 
mercy but the lost?”
57. He said, “So what is your business, O en￾voys?”
58. They said, “We were sent to a sinful peo￾ple.”
59. “Except for the family of Lot; we will save 
them all.”
60. “Except for his wife.” We have determined 
that she will be of those who lag behind.
61. And when the envoys came to the family of 
Lot.
62. He said, “You are a people unknown to 
me.”
63. They said, “We bring you what they have 
doubts about.”
64. “We bring you the truth, and we are truth￾ful.”
65. “Travel with your family at the dead of the 
night, and follow up behind them, and let 
none of you look back, and proceed as com￾manded.”
66. And We informed him of Our decree: the 
last remnant of these will be uprooted by 
early morning.
67. And the people of the town came joyfully.
68. He said, “These are my guests, so do not 
embarrass me.”
69. “And fear Allah, and do not disgrace me.”
70. They said, “Did we not forbid you from 
strangers?”
71. He said, “These are my daughters, if you 
must.”
72. By your life, they were blundering in their 
drunkenness.
95
16. THE BEE (an-Nahl)
73. So the Blast struck them at sunrise.
74. And We turned it upside down, and rained 
down upon them stones of baked clay.
75. Surely in that are lessons for those who 
read signs.
76. And it is on an existing road.
77. Surely in that is a sign for the believers.
78. The people of the Woods were also wrong￾doers.
79. So We took revenge upon them. Both are 
clearly documented.
80. The people of the Rock also rejected the 
messengers.
81. We gave them Our revelations, but they 
turned away from them.
82. They used to carve homes in the moun￾tains, feeling secure.
83. But the Blast struck them in the morning.
84. All they had acquired was of no avail to 
them. 
85. We did not create the heavens and the 
earth, and what lies between them, except 
with truth. The Hour is coming, so forgive 
with gracious forgiveness.
86. Your Lord is the All-Knowing Creator.
87. We have given you seven of the pairs, and 
the Grand Quran.
88. Do not extend your eyes towards what We 
have bestowed on some couples of them to 
enjoy, and do not grieve over them, and lower 
your wing to the believers.
89. And say, “I am the clear warner.”
90. Just as We sent down to the separatists.
91. Those who made the Quran obsolete.
92. By your Lord, we will question them all.
93. About what they used to do.
94. So proclaim openly what you are com￾manded, and turn away from the polytheists.
95. We are enough for you against the mock￾ers.
96. Those who set up another god with Allah. 
They will come to know.
97. We are aware that your heart is strained by 
what they say.
98. So glorify the praise of your Lord, and be 
among those who bow down.
99. And worship your Lord in order to attain 
certainty.
16. THE BEE
(an-Nahl)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. The command of Allah has come, so do not 
rush it. Glory be to Him; exalted above what 
they associate.
2. He sends down the angels with the Spirit by 
His command, upon whom He wills of His 
servants: “Give warning that there is no god 
but Me, and fear Me.”
3. He created the heavens and the earth with 
justice. He is exalted above the associations 
they attribute.
4. He created the human being from a drop of 
fluid, yet he becomes an open adversary.
5. And the livestock—He created them for 
you. In them are warmth and benefits for 
you, and of them you eat.
6. And there is beauty in them for you, when 
you bring them home, and when you drive 
them to pasture.
7. And they carry your loads to territory you 
could not have reached without great hard￾ship. Your Lord is Clement and Merciful.
8. And the horses, and the mules, and the don￾keys—for you to ride, and for luxury. And He 
creates what you do not know.
9. It is for Allah to point out the paths, but 
some of them are flawed. Had He willed, He 
could have guided you all.
96
16. THE BEE (an-Nahl)
10. It is He Who sends down for you from the 
sky water. From it is drink, and with it grows 
vegetation for grazing.
11. And He produces for you grains with it, 
and olives, and date-palms, and grapes, and 
all kinds of fruits. Surely in that is a sign for 
people who think. 
12. And He regulated for you the night and the 
day; and the sun, and the moon, and the stars 
are disposed by His command. Surely in that 
are signs for people who ponder.
13. And whatsoever He created for you on 
earth is of diverse colors. Surely in that is a 
sign for people who are mindful.
14. And it is He who made the sea to serve you, 
that you may eat from it tender meat, and ex￾tract from it ornaments that you wear. And 
you see the ships plowing through it, as you 
seek His bounties, so that you may give 
thanks.
15. And he cast mountains on the earth, lest it 
shifts with you; and rivers, and roads, so that 
you may be guided.
16. And landmarks. And by the stars they 
guide themselves.
17. Is He who creates like him who does not 
create? Will you not take a lesson?
18. And if you tried to enumerate the favors of 
Allah, you will not be able to count them. Al￾lah is Forgiving and Merciful.
19. And Allah knows what you hide and what 
you disclose.
20. Those they invoke besides Allah create 
nothing, but are themselves created.
21. They are dead, not alive; and they do not 
know when they will be resurrected.
22. Your God is one God. As for those who do 
not believe in the Hereafter, their hearts are 
in denial, and they are arrogant.
23. Without a doubt, Allah knows what they 
conceal and what they reveal. He does not 
like the arrogant.
24. And when it is said to them, “What has 
your Lord sent down?” They say, “Legends of 
the ancients.”
25. So let them carry their loads complete on 
the Day of Resurrection, and some of the 
loads of those they misguided without 
knowledge. Evil is what they carry.
26. Those before them also schemed, but Allah 
took their structures from the foundations, 
and the roof caved in on them. The punish￾ment came at them from where they did not 
perceive.
27. Then, on the Day of Resurrection, He will 
disgrace them, and say, “Where are My asso￾ciates for whose sake you used to dispute?” 
Those who were given knowledge will say, 
“Today shame and misery are upon the dis￾believers.”
28. Those wronging their souls while the an￾gels are taking them away—they will propose 
peace: “We did no wrong.” Yes you did. Allah 
is aware of what you used to do.”
29. Enter the gates of Hell, to dwell therein for￾ever. Miserable is the residence of the arro￾gant.
30. And it will be said to those who maintained 
piety, “What has your Lord revealed?” They 
will say, “Goodness.” To those who do good 
in this world is goodness, and the Home of 
the Hereafter is even better. How wonderful 
is the residence of the pious.
31. The Gardens of Perpetuity, which they will 
enter, beneath which rivers flow, where they 
will have whatever they desire. Thus Allah re￾wards the pious.
32. Those who are in a wholesome state when 
the angels take them—will say, “Peace be 
upon you; enter Paradise, for what you used 
to do.”
33. Are they but waiting for the angels to come 
to them, or for the command of your Lord to 
arrive? Those before them did likewise. Allah 
did not wrong them, but they used to wrong 
their own souls.
97
16. THE BEE (an-Nahl)
34. So the evils of their deeds assailed them, 
and what they used to ridicule engulfed them.
35. The idolaters say, “Had Allah willed, we 
would not have worshiped anything besides 
Him, neither us, nor our ancestors, nor 
would we have prohibited anything besides 
His prohibitions.” Those before them did 
likewise. Are the messengers responsible for
anything but clear communication?
36. To every community We sent a messenger: 
“Worship Allah, and avoid idolatry.” Some of 
them Allah guided, while others deserved 
misguidance. So travel through the earth, and 
see what the fate of the deniers was.
37. Even though you may be concerned about 
their guidance, Allah does not guide those 
who misguide. And they will have no saviors.
38. And they swear by Allah with their most 
solemn oaths, “Allah will not resurrect any￾one who dies.” Yes indeed, it is a promise 
binding on Him, but most people do not 
know.
39. To clarify for them what they differed 
about, and for the faithless to know that they 
were liars.
40. When We intend for something to happen, 
We say to it, “Be,” and it becomes.
41. Those who emigrate for Allah’s sake after 
being persecuted, We will settle them in a 
good place in this world; but the reward of 
the Hereafter is greater, if they only knew.
42. Those who endure patiently, and in their 
Lord they put their trust.
43. We did not send before you except men 
whom We inspired. So ask the people of 
knowledge, if you do not know.
44. With the clarifications and the scriptures. 
And We revealed to you the Reminder, that 
you may clarify to the people what was re￾vealed to them, and that they may reflect.
45. Do those who scheme evils feel secure that 
Allah will not cause the earth to cave in with 
them, or that the punishment will not come 
upon them from where they do not perceive?
46. Or that He will not seize them during their 
activities? And they will not be able to pre￾vent it.
47. Or that He will not seize them while in 
dread? Your Lord is Gentle and Merciful.
48. Have they not observed what Allah has cre￾ated? Their shadows revolve from the right 
and the left, bowing to Allah as they shrink 
away.
49. To Allah bows down everything in the 
heavens and everything on earth—every liv￾ing creature, and the angels, and without be￾ing proud.
50. They fear their Lord above them, and they 
do what they are commanded.
51. Allah has said: “Do not take two gods; He 
is only One God; so fear only Me.”
52. To Him belongs everything in the heavens 
and the earth; and to Him obedience is due 
always. Do you, then, fear anyone other than 
Allah?
53. Whatever blessing you have is from Allah. 
And when harm touches you, it is to Him that 
you groan.
54. But when He lifts the harm from you, some 
of you associate others with their Lord.
55. To show ingratitude for what We have 
given them. Enjoy yourselves. You will soon 
know.
56. And they allocate, to something they do 
not know, a share of what We have provided 
for them. By Allah, you will be questioned 
about what you have been inventing.
57. And they attribute to Allah daughters—ex￾alted is He—and for themselves what they de￾sire.
58. And when one of them is given news of a 
female infant, his face darkens, and he chokes 
with grief.
59. He hides from the people because of the 
bad news given to him. Shall he keep it in hu￾miliation, or bury it in the dust? Evil is the 
decision they make.
98
16. THE BEE (an-Nahl)
60. Those who do not believe in the Hereafter 
set a bad example, while Allah sets the High￾est Example. He is the Mighty, the Wise.
61. If Allah were to hold mankind for their in￾justices, He would not leave upon it a single 
creature, but He postpones them until an ap￾pointed time. Then, when their time arrives, 
they will not delay it by one hour, nor will 
they advance it.
62. And they attribute to Allah what they 
themselves dislike, while their tongues utter 
the lie that theirs is the goodness. Without a 
doubt, for them is the Fire, and they will be 
neglected.
63. By Allah, We sent messengers to commu￾nities before you, but Satan made their deeds 
appear alluring to them. He is their master 
today, and they will have a painful punish￾ment.
64. We revealed to you the Scripture only to 
clarify for them what they differ about, and 
guidance and mercy for people who believe.
65. Allah sends down water from the sky, with 
which He revives the earth after its death. In 
this is a sign for people who listen.
66. And there is a lesson for you in cattle: We 
give you a drink from their bellies, from be￾tween waste and blood, pure milk, refreshing 
to the drinkers.
67. And from the fruits of date-palms and 
grapevines, you derive sugar and wholesome 
food. In this is a sign for people who under￾stand.
68. And your Lord inspired the bee: “Set up 
hives in the mountains, and in the trees, and 
in what they construct.”
69. Then eat of all the fruits, and go along the 
pathways of your Lord, with precision. From 
their bellies emerges a fluid of diverse colors, 
containing healing for the people. Surely in 
this is a sign for people who reflect.
70. Allah created you; then He takes you away. 
Some of you will be brought back to the worst 
age, so that he will no longer know anything, 
after having acquired knowledge. Allah is 
Omniscient and Omnipotent.
71. Allah has favored some of you over others 
in livelihood. Those who are favored would 
not give their properties to their servants, to 
the extent of making them partners in it. Will 
they then renounce Allah’s blessings?
72. Allah has given you mates from among 
yourselves; and has produced for you, from 
your mates, children and grandchildren; and 
has provided you with good things. Will they 
then believe in falsehood, and refuse Allah’s 
favors?
73. And yet they serve besides Allah what pos￾sesses no provisions for them in the heavens, 
nor on earth, nor are they capable.
74. So do not cite the examples for Allah. Allah 
knows, and you do not know.
75. Allah cites the example of a bonded slave, 
who has no power over anything; and some￾one to whom We have given plentiful provi￾sion, from which he gives secretly and 
openly. Are they equal in comparison? All 
praise belongs to Allah, but most of them do 
not know.
76. And Allah cites the example of two men: 
one of them dumb, unable to do anything, 
and is a burden on his master; whichever way 
he directs him, he achieves nothing good. Is 
he equal to him who commands justice, and 
is on a straight path?
77. To Allah belongs the unseen of the heavens 
and the earth. The coming of the Hour is only 
as the twinkling of the eye, or even nearer. Al￾lah has power over everything.
78. Allah brought you out of your mothers’ 
wombs, not knowing anything; and He gave 
you the hearing, and the eyesight, and the 
brains; that you may give thanks.
79. Have they not seen the birds, flying in the 
midst of the sky? None sustains them except 
Allah. In this are signs for people who believe.
80. And Allah has given you in your homes 
habitats for you, and has provided for you out 
of the hides of livestock portable homes for 
99
16. THE BEE (an-Nahl)
you, so you can use them when you travel, 
and when you camp; and from their wool, 
and fur, and hair, furnishings and comfort 
for a while.
81. And Allah has made for you shade out of 
what He has created, and has given you re￾sorts in the mountains, and has given you 
garments to protect you from the heat, and 
garments to protect you from your violence. 
Thus He completes His blessings upon you, 
so that you may submit.
82. But if they turn away, your only duty is 
clear communication.
83. They recognize Allah’s blessing, but then 
deny it, as most of them are ungrateful.
84. On the Day when We raise up a witness 
from every community—those who disbe￾lieved will not be permitted, nor will they be 
excused.
85. When those who did wrong see the pun￾ishment, it will not be lightened for them, nor 
will they be reprieved.
86. And when the idolaters see their associates, 
they will say, “Our Lord, these are our associ￾ates whom we used to invoke besides You.” 
They will strike back at them with the saying, 
“Surely you are liars.”
87. On that Day they will offer their submis￾sion to Allah, and what they had invented will 
abandon them.
88. Those who disbelieve and obstruct from 
Allah’s path—We will add punishment to 
their punishment, on account of the mischief 
they used to make.
89. On the Day when We raise in every com￾munity a witness against them, from among 
them, and bring you as a witness against 
these. We have revealed to you the Book, as 
an explanation of all things, and guidance, 
and mercy and good news for those who sub￾mit.
90. Allah commands justice, and goodness, 
and generosity towards relatives. And He for￾bids immorality, and injustice, and oppres￾sion. He advises you, so that you may take 
heed.
91. Fulfill Allah’s covenant when you make a 
covenant, and do not break your oaths after 
ratifying them. You have made Allah your 
guarantor, and Allah knows what you do.
92. And do not be like her who unravels her 
yarn, breaking it into pieces, after she has 
spun it strongly. Nor use your oaths as means 
of deception among you, because one com￾munity is more prosperous than another. Al￾lah is testing you thereby. On the Day of Res￾urrection, He will make clear to you every￾thing you had disputed about. 
93. Had Allah willed, He would have made you 
one congregation, but He leaves astray whom 
He wills, and He guides whom He wills. And 
you will surely be questioned about what you 
used to do.
94. And do not use your oaths to deceive one 
another, so that a foot may not slip after being 
firm, and you taste misery because you hin￾dered from Allah’s path, and incur a terrible 
torment.
95. And do not exchange Allah’s covenant for 
a small price. What is with Allah is better for 
you, if you only knew.
96. What you have runs out, but what is with 
Allah remains. We will reward those who are 
patient according to the best of their deeds.
97. Whoever works righteousness, whether 
male or female, while being a believer, We 
will grant him a good life—and We will re￾ward them according to the best of what they 
used to do.
98. When you read the Quran, seek refuge 
with Allah from Satan the outcast.
99. He has no authority over those who believe 
and trust in their Lord.
100. His authority is only over those who fol￾low him, and those who associate others with 
Him.
101. When We substitute a verse in place of an￾other verse—and Allah knows best what He 
100
16. THE BEE (an-Nahl)
reveals—they say, “You are an impostor.” But 
most of them do not know.
102. Say, “The Holy Spirit has brought it down 
from your Lord, truthfully, in order to stabi￾lize those who believe, and as guidance and 
good news for those who submit.”
103. We are well aware that they say, “It is a hu￾man being who is teaching him.” But the 
tongue of him they allude to is foreign, while 
this is a clear Arabic tongue.
104. Those who do not believe in Allah’s reve￾lations—Allah will not guide them, and for 
them is a painful punishment.
105. It is those who do not believe in Allah’s 
revelations who fabricate falsehood. These 
are the liars.
106. Whoever renounces faith in Allah after 
having believed—except for someone who is 
compelled, while his heart rests securely in 
faith—but whoever willingly opens up his 
heart to disbelief—upon them falls wrath 
from Allah, and for them is a tremendous 
torment.
107. That is because they have preferred the 
worldly life to the Hereafter, and because Al￾lah does not guide the people who refuse.
108. It is they whom Allah has sealed their 
hearts, and their hearing, and their sight. It is 
they who are the heedless.
109. There is no doubt that in the Hereafter 
they will be the losers.
110. But then your Lord—for those who emi￾grated after being persecuted, then struggled 
and persevered—your Lord thereafter is For￾giving and Merciful.
111. On the Day when every soul will come 
pleading for itself, and every soul will be paid 
in full for what it has done, and they will not 
be wronged.
112. And Allah cites the example of a town that 
was secure and peaceful, with its livelihood 
coming to it abundantly from every direc￾tion. But then it turned unappreciative of Al￾lah’s blessings, so Allah made it taste the robe 
of hunger and fear, because of what they used 
to craft.
113. A messenger from among them had come 
to them, but they denounced him, so the 
punishment seized them in the midst of their 
wrongdoing.
114. Eat of the lawful and good things Allah has 
provided for you, and be thankful for Allah’s 
blessings, if it is Him that you serve.
115. He has forbidden you carrion, and blood, 
and the flesh of swine, and anything conse￾crated to other than Allah. But if anyone is 
compelled by necessity, without being delib￾erate or malicious, then Allah is Forgiving 
and Merciful.
116. And do not say of falsehood asserted by 
your tongues, “This is lawful, and this is un￾lawful,” in order to invent lies and attribute 
them to Allah. Those who invent lies and at￾tribute them to Allah will not succeed.
117. A brief enjoyment—then they will have a 
painful punishment.
118. For those who are Jews, We have prohib￾ited what We related to you before. We did 
not wrong them, but they used to wrong their 
own selves.
119. But towards those who do wrongs in igno￾rance, and then repent afterwards and re￾form, your Lord thereafter is Forgiving and 
Merciful.
120. Abraham was an exemplary leader, de￾voted to Allah, a monotheist, and was not of 
the polytheists.
121. Thankful for His blessings. He chose him, 
and guided him to a straight path.
122. And We gave him goodness in this world, 
and in the Hereafter he will be among the 
righteous.
123. Then We inspired you: “Follow the reli￾gion of Abraham, the Monotheist. He was 
not an idol-worshiper.”
124. The Sabbath was decreed only for those 
who differed about it. Your Lord will judge 
between them on the Day of Resurrection re￾garding their differences.
101
17. THE NIGHT JOURNEY (al-Isra’)
125. Invite to the way of your Lord with wis￾dom and good advice, and debate with them 
in the most dignified manner. Your Lord is 
aware of those who stray from His path, and 
He is aware of those who are guided.
126. If you were to retaliate, retaliate to the 
same degree as the injury done to you. But if 
you resort to patience—it is better for the pa￾tient.
127. So be patient. Your patience is solely from 
Allah. And do not grieve over them, and do 
not be stressed by their schemes.
128. Allah is with those who are righteous and 
those who are virtuous.
17. THE NIGHT JOURNEY
(al-Isra’)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Glory to Him who journeyed His servant by 
night, from the Sacred Mosque, to the Far￾thest Mosque, whose precincts We have 
blessed, in order to show him of Our won￾ders. He is the Listener, the Beholder.
2. And We gave Moses the Scripture, and 
made it a guide for the Children of Israel: 
Take none for protector other than Me.
3. The descendants of those We carried with 
Noah. He was an appreciative servant.
4. And We conveyed to the Children of Israel 
in the Scripture: You will commit evil on 
earth twice, and you will rise to a great height.
5. When the first of the two promises came 
true, We sent against you servants of Ours, 
possessing great might, and they ransacked 
your homes. It was a promise fulfilled.
6. Then We gave you back your turn against 
them, and supplied you with wealth and chil￾dren, and made you more numerous.
7. If you work righteousness, you work right￾eousness for yourselves; and if you commit 
evil, you do so against yourselves. Then, 
when the second promise comes true, they 
will make your faces filled with sorrow, and 
enter the Temple as they entered it the first 
time, and utterly destroy all that falls into 
their power.
8. Perhaps your Lord will have mercy on you. 
But if you revert, We will revert. We have 
made Hell a prison for the disbelievers.
9. This Quran guides to what is most upright; 
and it gives good news to the believers who 
do good deeds, that they will have a great re￾ward.
10. And those who do not believe in the Here￾after—We have prepared for them a painful 
punishment.
11. The human being prays for evil as he prays 
for good. The human being is very hasty.
12. We have made the night and the day two 
wonders. We erased the wonder of the night, 
and made the wonder of the day revealing, 
that you may seek bounty from your Lord, 
and know the number of years, and the cal￾culation. We have explained all things in de￾tail.
13. For every person We have attached his fate 
to his neck. And on the Day of Resurrection, 
We will bring out for him a book which he 
will find spread open.
14. “Read your book; today there will be none 
but yourself to call you to account.”
15. Whoever is guided—is guided for his own 
good. And whoever goes astray—goes astray 
to his detriment. No burdened soul carries 
the burdens of another, nor do We ever pun￾ish until We have sent a messenger.
16. When We decide to destroy a town, We 
command its affluent ones, they transgress in 
it, so the word becomes justified against it, 
and We destroy it completely.
17. How many generations have We destroyed 
after Noah? Your Lord is sufficient as 
Knower and Beholder of the sins of his serv￾ants.
18. Whoever desires the fleeting life, We expe￾dite for him what We decide to give him, to 
whomever We desire. Then We consign him 
102
17. THE NIGHT JOURNEY (al-Isra’)
to Hell, where he will roast, condemned and 
defeated.
19. But whoever desires the Hereafter, and 
pursues it as it should be pursued, while he is 
a believer; these—their effort will be appreci￾ated.
20. To all—these and those—We extend from 
the gifts of your Lord. The gifts of your Lord 
are not restricted.
21. See how We have favored some of them 
over others; yet the Hereafter is greater in 
ranks, and greater in favors.
22. Do not set up another god with Allah, lest 
you become condemned and damned.
23. Your Lord has commanded that you wor￾ship none but Him, and that you be good to 
your parents. If either of them or both of 
them reach old age with you, do not say to 
them a word of disrespect, nor scold them, 
but say to them kind words.
24. And lower to them the wing of humility, 
out of mercy, and say, “My Lord, have mercy 
on them, as they raised me when I was a 
child.”
25. Your Lord knows best what is in your 
minds. If you are righteous—He is Forgiving 
to the obedient.
26. And give the relative his rights, and the 
poor, and the wayfarer, and do not squander 
wastefully.
27. The extravagant are brethren of the devils, 
and the devil is ever ungrateful to his Lord.
28. But if you turn away from them, seeking 
mercy from your Lord which you hope for, 
then say to them words of comfort.
29. And do not keep your hand tied to your 
neck, nor spread it out fully, lest you end up 
liable and regretful.
30. Your Lord expands the provision for 
whomever He wills, and restricts it. He is 
fully Informed, Observant of His servants.
31. And do not kill your children for fear of 
poverty. We provide for them, and for you. 
Killing them is a grave sin.
32. And do not come near adultery. It is im￾moral, and an evil way.
33. And do not kill the soul which Allah has 
made sacred, except in the course of justice. 
If someone is killed unjustly, We have given 
his next of kin certain authority. But he 
should not be excessive in killing, for he will 
be supported.
34. And do not go near the orphan’s property, 
except with the best of intentions, until he has 
reached his maturity. And honor your 
pledge, because the pledge involves responsi￾bility.
35. And give full measure when you measure, 
and weigh with accurate scales. That is fair, 
and the best determination.
36. And do not occupy yourself with what you 
have no knowledge of. The hearing, and the 
sight, and the brains—all these will be ques￾tioned.
37. And do not walk proudly on earth. You can 
neither pierce the earth, nor can you match 
the mountains in height.
38. The evil of all these is disliked by your 
Lord.
39. That is some of the wisdom your Lord has 
revealed to you. Do not set up with Allah an￾other god, or else you will be thrown in Hell, 
rebuked and banished.
40. Has your Lord favored you with sons, 
while choosing for Himself daughters from 
among the angels? You are indeed saying a 
terrible thing.
41. We have explained in this Quran in various 
ways, that they may remember, but it only 
adds to their rebellion.
42. Say, “If there were other gods with Him, as 
they say, they would have sought a way to the 
Lord of the Throne.”
43. Be He glorified. He is exalted, far above 
what they say.
44. Praising Him are the seven heavens, and 
the earth, and everyone in them. There is not 
a thing that does not glorify Him with praise, 
103
17. THE NIGHT JOURNEY (al-Isra’)
but you do not understand their praises. He 
is indeed Forbearing and Forgiving.
45. When you read the Quran, We place be￾tween you and those who do not believe in 
the Hereafter an invisible barrier.
46. And We drape veils over their hearts, pre￾venting them from understanding it, and 
heaviness in their ears. And when you men￾tion your Lord alone in the Quran, they turn 
their backs in aversion.
47. We know well what they listen to, when 
they listen to you, as they conspire, when the 
wrongdoers say, “You only follow a man be￾witched.”
48. Note what they compared you to. They are 
lost, and unable to find a way.
49. And they say, “When we have become 
bones and fragments, shall we really be resur￾rected as a new creation?”
50. Say, “Even if you become rocks or iron.
51. Or some substance, which, in your minds, 
is even harder.” Then they will say, “Who will 
restore us?” Say, “The One who originated 
you the first time.” Then they will nod their 
heads at you, and say, “When will it be?” Say, 
“Perhaps it will be soon.”
52. On the Day when He calls you, you will re￾spond with His praise, and you will realize 
that you stayed only a little.
53. Tell My servants to say what is best. Satan 
sows discord among them. Satan is to man an 
open enemy. 
54. Your Lord knows you best. If He wills, He 
will have mercy on you; and if He wills, He 
will punish you. We did not send you as their 
advocate.
55. Your Lord knows well everyone in the 
heavens and the earth. We have given some 
prophets advantage over others; and to David 
We gave the Psalms.
56. Say, “Call upon those you claim besides 
Him. They have no power to relieve your ad￾versity, nor can they change it.”
57. Those they call upon are themselves seek￾ing means of access to their Lord, vying to be 
nearer, and hoping for His mercy, and fear￾ing His punishment. The punishment of your 
Lord is to be dreaded.
58. There is no city but We will destroy before 
the Day of Resurrection, or punish it with a 
severe punishment. This is inscribed in the 
Book.
59. Nothing prevents Us from sending mirac￾ulous signs, except that the ancients called 
them lies. We gave Thamood the she-camel, 
a visible sign, but they mistreated her. We do 
not send the signs except to instill reverence.
60. We said to you that your Lord encom￾passes humanity. We did not make the vision 
We showed you, except as a test for the peo￾ple, and the tree cursed in the Quran. We 
frighten them, but that only increases their 
defiance.
61. When We said to the angels, “Bow down 
before Adam,” they bowed down, except for 
Satan. He said, “Shall I bow down before 
someone You created from mud?”
62. He said, “Do You see this one whom You 
have honored more than me? If You reprieve 
me until the Day of Resurrection, I will bring 
his descendants under my sway, except for a 
few.”
63. He said, “Begone! Whoever of them fol￾lows you—Hell is your reward, an ample re￾ward.”
64. “And entice whomever of them you can 
with your voice, and rally against them your 
cavalry and your infantry, and share with 
them in wealth and children, and make 
promises to them.” But Satan promises them 
nothing but delusion.
65. “As for My devotees, you have no authority 
over them.” Your Lord is an adequate Guard￾ian.
66. Your Lord is He who propels for you the 
ships at sea, that you may seek of His bounty. 
He is towards you Most Merciful.
104
17. THE NIGHT JOURNEY (al-Isra’)
67. When harm afflicts you at sea, those you 
pray to vanish, except for Him. But when He 
saves you to land, you turn away. The human 
being is ever thankless.
68. Are you confident that He will not cause a 
track of land to cave in beneath you, or un￾leash a tornado against you, and then you 
find no protector?
69. Or are you confident that He will not re￾turn you to it once again, and unleash a hur￾ricane against you, and drown you for your 
ingratitude? Then you will find no helper 
against Us.
70. We have honored the Children of Adam, 
and carried them on land and sea, and pro￾vided them with good things, and greatly fa￾vored them over many of those We created.
71. On the Day when We call every people with 
their leader. Whoever is given his record in 
his right hand—these will read their record, 
and they will not be wronged one bit.
72. But whoever is blind in this, he will be 
blind in the Hereafter, and further astray 
from the way.
73. They almost lured you away from what We 
have revealed to you, so that you would in￾vent something else in Our name. In that 
case, they would have taken you for a friend.
74. Had We not given you stability, you might 
have inclined towards them a little.
75. Then We would have made you taste dou￾ble in life, and double at death; then you 
would have found for yourself no helper 
against Us.
76. They almost provoked you, to expel you 
from the land. In that case, they would not 
have lasted after you, except briefly.
77. The tradition of the messengers We sent 
before you—you will find no change in Our 
rules.
78. Perform the prayer at the decline of the 
sun, until the darkness of the night; and the 
Quran at dawn. The Quran at dawn is wit￾nessed.
79. And keep vigil with it during parts of the 
night, as an extra prayer. Perhaps your Lord 
will raise you to a laudable position.
80. And say, “My Lord, lead me in through an 
entry of truth, and lead me out through an 
exit of truth, and grant me from You a sup￾porting power.”
81. And say, “The truth has come, and false￾hood has withered away; for falsehood is 
bound to wither away.”
82. We send down in the Quran healing and 
mercy for the believers, but it increases the 
wrongdoers only in loss.
83. When We bless the human being, he turns 
away and distances himself. But when adver￾sity touches him, he is in despair.
84. Say, “Each does according to his disposi￾tion. Your Lord knows best who is better 
guided in the way.”
85. And they ask you about the Spirit. Say, 
“The Spirit belongs to the domain of my 
Lord; and you were given only little 
knowledge.”
86. If We willed, We could take away what We 
revealed to you. Then you will find for your￾self no protecting guardian against Us.
87. Except through a mercy from your Lord. 
His favors upon you have been great.
88. Say, “If mankind and jinn came together to 
produce the like of this Quran, they could 
never produce the like of it, even if they 
backed up one another.”
89. We have displayed for mankind in this 
Quran every kind of similitude, but most 
people insist on denying the truth.
90. And they said, “We will not believe in you 
unless you make a spring burst from the 
ground for us.
91. Or you have a garden of palms and vines; 
then cause rivers to gush pouring through 
them.
92. Or make the sky fall on us in pieces, as you 
claim, or bring Allah and the angels before us.

18. THE CAVE (al-Kahf)
93. Or you possess a house of gold. Or you as￾cend into the sky. Even then, we will not be￾lieve in your ascension, unless you bring 
down for us a book that we can read.” Say, 
“Glory be to my Lord. Am I anything but a 
human messenger?”
94. Nothing prevented the people from believ￾ing, when guidance has come to them, except 
that they said, “Did Allah send a human mes￾senger?”
95. Say, “If there were angels on earth, walking 
around in peace, We would have sent down 
to them from heaven an angel messenger.”
96. Say, “Allah is enough witness between you 
and me. He is fully aware of His servants, and 
He sees them well.”
97. Whomever Allah guides is the guided one. 
And whomever He leaves astray—for them 
you will find no protectors apart from Him. 
And We will gather them on the Day of Res￾urrection, on their faces, blind, dumb, and 
deaf. Their abode is Hell; whenever it abates, 
We intensify the blaze for them.
98. This is their repayment for having blas￾phemed against Our revelations, and having 
said, “Shall we, when we have become bones 
and fragments, be resurrected as a new crea￾tion?”
99. Do they not consider that Allah, Who cre￾ated the heavens and the earth, is Able to cre￾ate the likes of them? He has assigned for 
them a term, in which there is no doubt. But 
the wrongdoers persist in denying the truth.
100. Say, “If you possessed the treasuries of my 
Lord’s mercy, you would have withheld them 
for fear of spending.” The human being has 
always been stingy.
101. We gave Moses nine clear signs—ask the 
Children of Israel. When he went to them, 
Pharaoh said to him, “I think that you, Mo￾ses, are bewitched.”
102. He said, “You know that none sent these 
down except the Lord of the heavens and the 
earth—eye openers; and I think that you, 
Pharaoh, are doomed.”
103. He resolved to scare them off the land, but 
We drowned him, and those with him, alto￾gether.
104. After him, We said to the Children of Is￾rael, “Inhabit the land, and when the promise 
of the Hereafter arrives, We will bring you all 
together.”
105. With the truth We sent it down, and with 
the truth it descended. We sent you only as a 
bearer of good news and a warner.
106. A Quran which We unfolded gradually, 
that you may recite to the people over time. 
And We revealed it in stages.
107. Say, “Believe in it, or do not believe.” 
Those who were given knowledge before it, 
when it is recited to them, they fall to their 
chins, prostrating.
108. And they say, “Glory to our Lord. The 
promise of our Lord is fulfilled.”
109. And they fall to their chins, weeping, and 
it adds to their humility.
110. Say, “Call Him Allah, or call Him the Most 
Merciful. Whichever name you use, to Him 
belong the Best Names.” And be neither loud 
in your prayer, nor silent in it, but follow a 
course in between.
111. And say, “Praise be to Allah, who has not 
begotten a son, nor has He a partner in sov￾ereignty, nor has He an ally out of weakness, 
and glorify Him constantly.”
18. THE CAVE
(al-Kahf)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Praise be to Allah, who revealed the Book to 
His servant, and allowed in it no distortion.
2. Valuable—to warn of severe punishment 
from Himself; and to deliver good news to the 
believers who do righteous deeds, that they 
will have an excellent reward.
3. In which they will abide forever. 
106
18. THE CAVE (al-Kahf)
4. And to warn those who say, “Allah has be￾gotten a son.”
5. They have no knowledge of this, nor did 
their forefathers. Grave is the word that 
comes out of their mouths. They say nothing 
but a lie. 
6. Perhaps you may destroy yourself with 
grief, chasing after them, if they do not be￾lieve in this information.
7. We made what is upon the earth an orna￾ment for it, to test them as to which of them 
is best in conduct.
8. And We will turn what is on it into barren 
waste.
9. Did you know that the People of the Cave 
and the Inscription were of Our wondrous 
signs?
10. When the youths took shelter in the cave, 
they said, “Our Lord, give us mercy from 
Yourself, and bless our affair with guidance.”
11. Then We sealed their ears in the cave for a 
number of years.
12. Then We awakened them to know which 
of the two groups could better calculate the 
length of their stay.
13. We relate to you their story in truth. They 
were youths who believed in their Lord, and 
We increased them in guidance.
14. And We strengthened their hearts, when 
they stood up and said, “Our Lord is the Lord 
of the heavens and the earth; we will not call 
on any god besides Him, for then we would 
have spoken an outrage.”
15. “These people, our people, have taken to 
themselves gods other than Him. Why do 
they not bring a clear proof concerning 
them? Who, then, does greater wrong than he 
who invents lies and attributes them to Al￾lah?”
16. “Now that you have withdrawn from them, 
and from what they worship besides Allah, 
take shelter in the cave. And your Lord will 
unfold His mercy for you, and will set your 
affair towards ease.”
17. You would have seen the sun, when it rose, 
veering away from their cave towards the 
right, and when it sets, moving away from 
them to the left, as they lay in the midst of the 
cave. That was one of Allah’s wonders. He 
whom Allah guides is truly guided; but he 
whom He misguides, for him you will find no 
directing friend.
18. You would think them awake, although 
they were asleep. And We turned them over 
to the right, and to the left, with their dog 
stretching its paws across the threshold. Had 
you looked at them, you would have turned 
away from them in flight, and been filled with 
fear of them.
19. Even so, We awakened them, so that they 
may ask one another. A speaker among them 
said, “How long have you stayed?” They said, 
“We have stayed a day, or part of a day.” They 
said, “Your Lord knows best how long you 
have stayed.” “Send one of you to the city, 
with this money of yours, and let him see 
which food is most suitable, and let him bring 
you some provision thereof. And let him be 
gentle, and let no one become aware of you.”
20. “If they discover you, they will stone you, 
or force you back into their religion; then you 
will never be saved.”
21. So it was, that We caused them to be dis￾covered, that they would know that the 
promise of Allah is true, and that of the Hour 
there is no doubt. As they were disputing 
their case among themselves, they said, 
“Build over them a building.” Their Lord 
knows best about them. Those who prevailed 
over their case said, “We will set up over them 
a place of worship.”
22. They will say, “Three, and their fourth be￾ing their dog.” And they will say, “Five, and 
their sixth being their dog,” guessing at the 
unknown. And they will say, “Seven, and 
their eighth being their dog.” Say, “My Lord 
knows best their number.” None knows them 
except a few. So do not argue concerning 
them except with an obvious argument, and 
do not consult any of them about them.
107
18. THE CAVE (al-Kahf)
23. And never say about anything, “I will do 
that tomorrow.”
24. Without saying, “If Allah wills.” And re￾member your Lord if you forget, and say, 
“Perhaps my Lord will guide me to nearer 
than this in integrity.”
25. And they stayed in their cave for three hun￾dred years, adding nine.
26. Say, “Allah knows best how long they 
stayed.” His is the mystery of the heavens and 
the earth. By Him you see and hear. They 
have no guardian apart from Him, and He 
shares His Sovereignty with no one.
27. And recite what was revealed to you from 
the Book of your Lord. There is no changing 
His words, and you will find no refuge except 
in Him.
28. And content yourself with those who pray 
to their Lord morning and evening, desiring 
His Presence. And do not turn your eyes 
away from them, desiring the glitter of this 
world. And do not obey him whose heart We 
have made heedless of Our remembrance—
so he follows his own desires—and his prior￾ities are confused.
29. And say, “The truth is from your Lord. 
Whoever wills—let him believe. And who￾ever wills—let him disbelieve”. We have pre￾pared for the unjust a Fire, whose curtains 
will hem them in. And when they cry for re￾lief, they will be relieved with water like mol￾ten brass, which scalds the faces. What a mis￾erable drink, and what a terrible place.
30. As for those who believe and lead a right￾eous life—We will not waste the reward of 
those who work righteousness.
31. These will have the Gardens of Eden, be￾neath which rivers flow. Reclining on com￾fortable furnishings, they will be adorned 
with bracelets of gold, and will wear green 
garments of silk and brocade. What a won￾derful reward, and what an excellent resting￾place.
32. And cite for them the parable of two men. 
To one of them We gave two gardens of vine, 
and We surrounded them with palm-trees, 
and We placed between them crops.
33. Both gardens produced their harvest in 
full, and suffered no loss. And We made a 
river flow through them.
34. And thus he had abundant fruits. He said 
to his friend, as he conversed with him, “I am 
wealthier than you, and greater in man￾power.”
35. And he entered his garden, wronging him￾self. He said, “I do not think this will ever per￾ish.”
36. “And I do not think the Hour is coming. 
And even if I am returned to my Lord, I will 
find something better than this in return.”
37. His friend said to him, as he conversed 
with him, “Are you being ungrateful to Him 
who created you from dust, then from a 
sperm-drop, then evolved you into a man?
38. But as for me, He is Allah, my Lord, and I 
never associate with my Lord anyone.
39. When you entered your garden, why did 
you not say, “As Allah wills; there is no power 
except through Allah”? Although you see me 
inferior to you in wealth and children.
40. Perhaps my Lord will give me something 
better than your garden, and release upon it 
thunderbolts from the sky, so it becomes bar￾ren waste.
41. Or its water will sink into the ground, and 
you will be unable to draw it.”
42. And ruin closed in on his crops, and so he 
began wringing his hands over what he had 
invested in it, as it lays fallen upon its trellises. 
And he was saying, “I wish I never associated 
anyone with my Lord.”
43. He had no faction to help him besides Al￾lah, and he was helpless.
44. That is because authority belongs to Allah, 
the True. He is Best in rewarding, and Best in 
requiting.
45. And cite for them the parable of the pre￾sent life: it is like water that We send down 
from the sky; the plants of the earth absorb it; 
108
18. THE CAVE (al-Kahf)
but then it becomes debris, scattered by the 
wind. Allah has absolute power over every￾thing.
46. Wealth and children are the adornments of 
the present life. But the things that last, the 
virtuous deeds, are better with your Lord for 
reward, and better for hope.
47. On the Day when We set the mountains in 
motion; and you see the earth emerging; and 
We gather them together, and leave none of 
them behind.
48. They will be presented before your Lord in 
a row. “You have come to Us as We created 
you the first time. Although you claimed We 
would not set a meeting for you.”
49. And the book will be placed, and you will 
see the sinners fearful of its contents. And 
they will say, “Woe to us! What is with this 
book that leaves nothing, small or big, but it 
has enumerated it?” They will find everything 
they had done present. Your Lord does not 
wrong anyone. 
50. We said to the angels, “Bow down to 
Adam.” So they bowed down, except for Sa￾tan. He was of the jinn, and he defied the 
command of his Lord. Will you take him and 
his offspring as lords instead of Me, when 
they are an enemy to you? Evil is the ex￾change for the wrongdoers.
51. I did not call them to witness the creation 
of the heavens and the earth, nor their own 
creation; and I do not take the misleaders for 
assistants.
52. On the Day when He will say, “Call on My 
partners whom you have claimed.” They will 
call on them, but they will not answer them. 
And We will place between them a barrier.
53. And the sinners will see the Fire, and will 
realize that they will tumble into it. They will 
find no deliverance from it.
54. We have elaborated in this Quran for the 
people every kind of example, but the human 
being is a most argumentative being.
55. What prevented people from accepting 
faith, when guidance has come to them, and 
from seeking their Lord’s forgiveness? Unless 
they are waiting for the precedent of the an￾cients to befall them, or to have the punish￾ment come upon them face to face.
56. We send the messengers only as deliverers 
of good news and warners. Those who disbe￾lieve argue with false argument, in order to 
defeat the truth thereby. They take My 
Verses, and the warnings, for a joke.
57. Who does greater wrong than he, who, 
when reminded of his Lord’s revelations,
turns away from them, and forgets what his 
hands have put forward? We have placed 
coverings over their hearts, lest they under￾stand it, and heaviness in their ears. And if 
you call them to guidance, they will not be 
guided, ever.
58. Your Lord is the Forgiver, Possessor of 
Mercy. Were He to call them to account for 
what they have earned, He would have has￾tened the punishment for them. But they 
have an appointment from which they will 
find no escape.
59. And these towns—We destroyed them 
when they committed injustices, and We set 
for their destruction an appointed time.
60. Recall when Moses said to his servant, “I 
will not give up until I reach the junction of 
the two rivers, even if it takes me years.”
61. Then, when they reached the junction be￾tween them, they forgot about their fish. It 
found its way into the river, slipping away.
62. When they went further, he said to his 
servant, “Bring us our lunch; we were ex￾posed in our travel to much fatigue.”
63. He said, “Do you remember when we 
rested by the rock? I forgot about the fish. It 
was only the devil who made me forget it. 
And so it found its way to the river, amaz￾ingly.”
64. He said, “This is what we were seeking.” 
And so they turned back retracing their steps.
65. Then they came upon a servant of Ours, 
whom We had blessed with mercy from Us, 
109
18. THE CAVE (al-Kahf)
and had taught him knowledge from Our 
Own.
66. Moses said to him, “May I follow you, so 
that you may teach me some of the guidance 
you were taught?”
67. He said, “You will not be able to endure 
with me.
68. And how will you endure what you have no 
knowledge of?”
69. He said, “You will find me, Allah willing, 
patient; and I will not disobey you in any or￾der of yours.”
70. He said, “If you follow me, do not ask me 
about anything, until I myself make mention 
of it to you.”
71. So they set out. Until, when they had 
boarded the boat, he holed it. He said, “Did 
you hole it, to drown its passengers? You 
have done something awful.”
72. He said, “Did I not tell you that you will not 
be able to endure with me?”
73. He said, “Do not rebuke me for forgetting, 
and do not make my course difficult for me.”
74. Then they set out. Until, when they en￾countered a boy, he killed him. He said, “Did 
you kill a pure soul, who killed no one? You 
have done something terrible.”
75. He said,“Did I not tell you that you will not 
be able to endure with me?”
76. He said, “If I ask you about anything after 
this, then do not keep company with me. You 
have received excuses from me.”
77. So they set out. Until, when they reached 
the people of a town, they asked them for 
food, but they refused to offer them hospital￾ity. There they found a wall about to collapse, 
and he repaired it. He said, “If you wanted, 
you could have obtained a payment for it.”
78. He said, “This is the parting between you 
and me. I will tell you the interpretation of 
what you were unable to endure.
79. As for the boat, it belonged to paupers 
working at sea. I wanted to damage it because 
there was a king coming after them seizing 
every boat by force.
80. As for the boy, his parents were believers, 
and we feared he would overwhelm them 
with oppression and disbelief.
81. So we wanted their Lord to replace him 
with someone better in purity, and closer to 
mercy.
82. And as for the wall, it belonged to two or￾phaned boys in the town. Beneath it was a 
treasure that belonged to them. Their father 
was a righteous man. Your Lord wanted them 
to reach their maturity, and then extract their 
treasure—as a mercy from your Lord. I did 
not do it of my own accord. This is the inter￾pretation of what you were unable to en￾dure.”
83. And they ask you about Zul-Qarnain. Say, 
“I will tell you something about him.”
84. We established him on earth, and gave him 
all kinds of means.
85. He pursued a certain course.
86. Until, when he reached the setting of the 
sun, he found it setting in a murky spring, 
and found a people in its vicinity. We said, “O 
Zul-Qarnain, you may either inflict a penalty, 
or else treat them kindly.”
87. He said, “As for him who does wrong, we 
will penalize him, then he will be returned to 
his Lord, and He will punish him with an un￾heard-of torment.
88. “But as for him who believes and acts right￾eously, he will have the finest reward, and We 
will speak to him of Our command with 
ease.”
89. Then he pursued a course.
90. Until, when he reached the rising of the 
sun, he found it rising on a people for whom 
We had provided no shelter from it.
91. And so it was. We had full knowledge of 
what he had.
92. Then he pursued a course.
93. Until, when he reached the point separat￾ing the two barriers, he found beside them a 
110
19. MARY (Maryam)
people who could barely understand what is 
said.
94. They said, “O Zul-Qarnain, the Gog and 
Magog are spreading chaos in the land. Can 
we pay you, to build between us and them a 
wall?”
95. He said, “What my Lord has empowered 
me with is better. But assist me with strength, 
and I will build between you and them a 
dam.”
96. “Bring me blocks of iron.” So that, when he 
had leveled up between the two cliffs, he said, 
“Blow.” And having turned it into a fire, he 
said, “Bring me tar to pour over it.”
97. So they were unable to climb it, and they 
could not penetrate it.
98. He said, “This is a mercy from my Lord. 
But when the promise of my Lord comes true, 
He will turn it into rubble, and the promise 
of my Lord is always true.”
99. On that Day, We will leave them surging 
upon one another. And the Trumpet will be 
blown, and We will gather them together.
100. On that Day, We will present the disbe￾lievers to Hell, all displayed.
101. Those whose eyes were screened to My 
message, and were unable to hear.
102. Do those who disbelieve think that they 
can take My servants for masters instead of 
Me? We have prepared Hell for the hospital￾ity of the faithless.
103. Say, “Shall We inform you of the greatest 
losers in their works?”
104. “Those whose efforts in this world are 
misguided, while they assume that they are 
doing well.”
105. It is they who rejected the communica￾tions of their Lord, and the encounter with 
Him. So their works are in vain. And on the 
Day of Resurrection, We will consider them 
of no weight.
106. That is their requital—Hell—on account 
of their disbelief, and their taking My revela￾tions and My messengers in mockery.
107. As for those who believe and do righteous 
deeds, they will have the Gardens of Paradise 
for hospitality.
108. Abiding therein forever, without desiring 
any change therefrom.
109. Say, “If the ocean were ink for the words 
of my Lord, the ocean would run out, before 
the words of my Lord run out,” even if We 
were to bring the like of it in addition to it.
110. Say, “I am only a human being like you, 
being inspired that your god is One God. 
Whoever hopes to meet his Lord, let him 
work righteousness, and never associate any￾one with the service of his Lord.”
19. MARY
(Maryam)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Kaf, Ha, Ya, Ayn, Saad.
2. A mention of the mercy of your Lord to￾wards His servant Zechariah.
3. When he called on his Lord, a call in seclu￾sion.
4. He said, “My Lord, my bones have become 
feeble, and my hair is aflame with gray, and 
never, Lord, have I been disappointed in my 
prayer to you.
5. “And I fear for my dependents after me, and 
my wife is barren. So grant me, from Your￾self, an heir.
6. To inherit me, and inherit from the House 
of Jacob, and make him, my Lord, pleasing.”
7. “O Zechariah, We give you good news of a 
son, whose name is John, a name We have 
never given before.”
8. He said, “My Lord, how can I have a son, 
when my wife is barren, and I have become 
decrepit with old age?”
9. He said, “It will be so, your Lord says, ‘it is 
easy for me, and I created you before, when 
you were nothing.’”
111
19. MARY (Maryam)
10. He said, “My Lord, give me a sign.” He said, 
“Your sign is that you will not speak to the 
people for three nights straight.”
11. And he came out to his people, from the 
sanctuary, and signaled to them to praise 
morning and evening.
12. “O John, hold on to the Scripture firmly,” 
and We gave him wisdom in his youth.
13. And tenderness from Us, and innocence. 
He was devout.
14. And kind to his parents; and he was not a 
disobedient tyrant.
15. And peace be upon him the day he was 
born, and the day he dies, and the Day he is 
raised alive.
16. And mention in the Scripture Mary, when 
she withdrew from her people to an eastern 
location.
17. She screened herself away from them, and 
We sent to her Our spirit, and He appeared 
to her as an immaculate human.
18. She said, “I take refuge from you in the 
Most Merciful, should you be righteous.”
19. He said, “I am only the messenger of your 
Lord, to give you the gift of a pure son.”
20. She said, “How can I have a son, when no 
man has touched me, and I was never un￾chaste?”
21. He said, “Thus said your Lord, `It is easy 
for Me, and We will make him a sign for hu￾manity, and a mercy from Us. It is a matter 
already decided.'“
22. So she carried him, and secluded herself 
with him in a remote place.
23. The labor-pains came upon her, by the 
trunk of a palm-tree. She said, “I wish I had 
died before this, and been completely forgot￾ten.”
24. Whereupon he called her from beneath 
her: “Do not worry; your Lord has placed a 
stream beneath you.
25. And shake the trunk of the palm-tree to￾wards you, and it will drop ripe dates by you.”
26. “So eat, and drink, and be consoled. And if 
you see any human, say, ‘I have vowed a fast 
to the Most Gracious, so I will not speak to 
any human today.'“
27.Then she came to her people, carrying him. 
They said, “O Mary, you have done some￾thing terrible.
28. O sister of Aaron, your father was not an 
evil man, and your mother was not a whore.”
29. So she pointed to him. They said, “How 
can we speak to an infant in the crib?”
30. He said, “I am the servant of Allah. He has 
given me the Scripture, and made me a 
prophet.
31. And has made me blessed wherever I may 
be; and has enjoined on me prayer and char￾ity, so long as I live.
32. And kind to my mother, and He did not 
make me a disobedient rebel.
33. So Peace is upon me the day I was born, 
and the day I die, and the Day I get resur￾rected alive.”
34. That is Jesus son of Mary—the Word of 
truth about which they doubt.
35. It is not for Allah to have a child—glory be 
to Him. To have anything done, He says to it, 
“Be,” and it becomes.
36. “Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so wor￾ship Him. That is a straight path.”
37. But the various factions differed among 
themselves. So woe to those who disbelieve 
from the scene of a tremendous Day.
38. Listen to them and watch for them the Day 
they come to Us. But the wrongdoers today 
are completely lost.
39. And warn them of the Day of Regret, when 
the matter will be concluded. Yet they are 
heedless, and they do not believe.
40. It is We who will inherit the earth and eve￾ryone on it, and to Us they will be returned.
41. And mention in the Scripture Abraham. 
He was a man of truth, a prophet.
112
19. MARY (Maryam)
42. He said to his father, “O my father, why do 
you worship what can neither hear, nor see, 
nor benefit you in any way?
43. O my father, there has come to me 
knowledge that never came to you. So follow 
me, and I will guide you along a straight way.
44. O my father, do not worship the devil. The 
devil is disobedient to the Most Gracious.
45. O my father, I fear that a punishment from 
the Most Gracious will afflict you, and you 
become an ally of the devil.”
46. He said, “Are you renouncing my gods, O 
Abraham? If you do not desist, I will stone 
you. So leave me alone for a while.”
47. He said, “Peace be upon you. I will ask my 
Lord to forgive you; He has been Kind to me.
48. And I will withdraw from you, and from 
what you pray to instead of Allah. And I will 
pray to my Lord, and I hope I will not be dis￾appointed in my prayer to my Lord.”
49. When he withdrew from them, and from 
what they worship besides Allah, We granted 
him Isaac and Jacob. And each We made a 
prophet.
50. And We gave them freely of Our mercy, 
and gave them a noble reputation of truth.
51. And mention in the Scripture Moses. He 
was dedicated. He was a messenger and a 
prophet.
52. And We called him from the right side of 
the Mount, and brought him near in com￾munion.
53. And We granted him, out of Our mercy, 
his brother Aaron, a prophet.
54. And mention in the Scripture Ishmael. He 
was true to his promise, and was a messenger, 
a prophet.
55. And he used to enjoin on his people prayer 
and charity, and he was pleasing to his Lord.
56. And mention in the Scripture Enoch. He 
was a man of truth, a prophet.
57. And We raised him to a high position.
58. These are some of the prophets Allah has 
blessed, from the descendants of Adam, and 
from those We carried with Noah, and from 
the descendants of Abraham and Israel, and 
from those We guided and selected. When￾ever the revelations of the Most Gracious are 
recited to them, they would fall down, pros￾trating and weeping.
59. But they were succeeded by generations 
who lost the prayers and followed their appe￾tites. They will meet perdition.
60. Except for those who repent, and believe, 
and act righteously. These will enter Paradise, 
and will not be wronged in the least.
61. The Gardens of Eden, promised by the 
Most Merciful to His servants in the Unseen. 
His promise will certainly come true.
62. They will hear no nonsense therein, but 
only peace. And they will have their provision 
therein, morning and evening.
63. Such is Paradise which We will give as in￾heritance to those of Our servants who are 
devout.
64. “We do not descend except by the com￾mand of your Lord. His is what is before us, 
and what is behind us, and what is between 
them. Your Lord is never forgetful.”
65. Lord of the heavens and the earth and what 
is between them. So worship Him, and perse￾vere in His service. Do you know of anyone 
equal to Him?
66. And the human being says, “When I am 
dead, will I be brought back alive?”
67. Does the human being not remember that 
We created him before, when he was noth￾ing?
68. By your Lord, We will round them up, and 
the devils, then We will bring them around 
Hell, on their knees.
69. Then, out of every sect, We will snatch 
those most defiant to the Most Merciful.
70. We are fully aware of those most deserving 
to scorch in it.
113
20. TA-HA (Ta-Ha)
71. There is not one of you but will go down to 
it. This has been an unavoidable decree of 
your Lord.
72. Then We will rescue those who were de￾vout, and leave the wrongdoers in it, on their 
knees.
73. When Our clear revelations are recited to 
them, those who disbelieve say to those who 
believe, “Which of the two parties is better in 
position, and superior in influence?”
74. How many a generation have We de￾stroyed before them, who surpassed them in 
riches and splendor?
75. Say, “Whoever is in error, the Most Merci￾ful will lead him on.” Until, when they see 
what they were promised—either the punish￾ment, or the Hour. Then they will know who 
was in worse position and weaker in forces.
76. Allah increases in guidance those who ac￾cept guidance. And the things that endure—
the righteous deeds—have the best reward 
with your Lord, and the best outcome.
77. Have you seen him who denied Our reve￾lations, and said, “I will be given wealth and 
children”?
78. Did he look into the future, or did he re￾ceive a promise from the Most Merciful?
79. No indeed! We will write what he says, and 
will keep extending the agony for him.
80. Then We will inherit from him what he 
speaks of, and he will come to Us alone.
81. And they took, besides Allah, other gods, 
to be for them a source of strength.
82. By no means! They will reject their worship 
of them, and become opponents to them.
83. Have you not considered how We dispatch
the devils against the disbelievers, exciting 
them with incitement?
84. So do not hurry against them. We are 
counting for them a countdown.
85. On the Day when We will gather the right￾eous to the Most Merciful, as guests.
86. And herd the sinners into hell, like animals 
to water.
87. They will have no power of intercession, 
except for someone who has an agreement 
with the Most Merciful.
88. And they say, “The Most Merciful has be￾gotten a son.”
89. You have come up with something mon￾strous.
90. At which the heavens almost rupture, and 
the earth splits, and the mountains fall and 
crumble.
91. Because they attribute a son to the Most 
Merciful.
92. It is not fitting for the Most Merciful to 
have a son.
93. There is none in the heavens and the earth 
but will come to the Most Merciful as a serv￾ant.
94. He has enumerated them, and counted 
them one by one. 
95. And each one of them will come to Him on 
the Day of Resurrection alone.
96. Those who believe and do righteous deeds, 
the Most Merciful will give them love.
97. We made it easy in your tongue, in order 
to deliver good news to the righteous, and to 
warn with it a hostile people.
98. How many a generation have We de￾stroyed before them? Can you feel a single 
one of them, or hear from them the slightest 
whisper?
20. TA-HA
(Ta-Ha)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Ta, Ha.
2. We did not reveal the Quran to you to make 
you suffer.
3. But only as a reminder for him who fears.
4. A revelation from He who created the earth 
and the high heavens.
114
20. TA-HA (Ta-Ha)
5. The Most Merciful; on the Throne He set￾tled.
6. To Him belongs everything in the heavens 
and the earth, and everything between them, 
and everything beneath the soil.
7. If you speak aloud—He knows the secret, 
and the most hidden.
8. Allah, there is no god but He, His are the 
Most Beautiful Names. 
9. Has the story of Moses reached you?
10. When he saw a fire, he said to his family, 
“Stay; I have noticed a fire; Perhaps I can 
bring you a torch therefrom, or find some 
guidance by the fire.”
11. Then, when he reached it, he was called, “O 
Moses.
12. I—I am your Lord. Take off your shoes. 
You are in the sacred valley of Tuwa.
13. I have chosen you, so listen to what is re￾vealed.
14. I—I am Allah. There is no God but I. So 
serve Me, and practice the prayer for My re￾membrance.
15. The Hour is coming—but I keep it almost 
hidden—so that each soul will be paid for 
what it endeavors.
16. And do not let him who denies it and fol￾lows his desire turn you away from it, lest you 
fall.
17. And what is that in your right-hand, O Mo￾ses?”
18. He said, “This is my staff. I lean on it, and 
herd my sheep with it, and I have other uses 
for it.”
19. He said, “Throw it, O Moses.”
20. So he threw it—thereupon it became a 
moving serpent.
21. He said, “Take hold of it, and do not fear. 
We will restore it to its original condition.
22. And press your hand to your side; it will 
come out white, without a blemish—another 
sign.
23. That We may show you some of Our great￾est signs.
24. Go to Pharaoh; He has transgressed.”
25. He said, “My Lord, put my heart at peace 
for me.
26. And ease my task for me.
27. And untie the knot from my tongue.
28. So they can understand my speech.
29. And appoint an assistant for me, from my 
family. 
30. Aaron, my brother.
31. Strengthen me with him.
32. And have him share in my mission.
33. That we may glorify You much.
34. And remember You much.
35. You are always watching over us.”
36. He said, “You are granted your request, O 
Moses.
37. We had favored you another time.
38. When We inspired your mother with the 
inspiration.
39. `Put him in the chest; then cast him into 
the river. The river will wash him to shore, 
where an enemy of Mine and an enemy of his 
will pick him up. And I have bestowed upon 
you love from Me, so that you may be reared 
before My eye.
40. When your sister walked along, and said, 
‘Shall I tell you about someone who will take 
care of him?' So We returned you to your 
mother, that she may be comforted, and not 
sorrow. And you killed a person, but We 
saved you from stress; and We tested you 
thoroughly. And you stayed years among the 
people of Median. Then you came back, as 
ordained, O Moses.
41. And I made you for Myself.
42. Go, you and your brother, with My signs, 
and do not neglect My remembrance.
43. Go to Pharaoh. He has tyrannized.
115
20. TA-HA (Ta-Ha)
44. But speak to him nicely. Perhaps he will re￾member, or have some fear.”
45. They said, “Lord, we fear he may persecute 
us, or become violent.”
46. He said, “Do not fear, I am with you, I hear 
and I see.
47. Approach him and say, `We are the mes￾sengers of your Lord; so let the Children of 
Israel go with us, and do not torment them. 
We bring you a sign from your Lord, and 
peace be upon him who follows guidance.
48. It was revealed to us that the punishment 
falls upon him who disbelieves and turns 
away.'“
49. He said, “Who is your Lord, O Moses.”
50. He said, “Our Lord is He who gave every￾thing its existence, then guided it.”
51. He said, “What about the first genera￾tions?”
52. He said, “Knowledge thereof is with my 
Lord, in a Book. My Lord never errs, nor does 
He forget.”
53. He who made the earth a habitat for you; 
and traced in it routes for you; and sent down 
water from the sky, with which We produce 
pairs of diverse plants.
54. Eat and pasture your livestock. In that are 
signs for those with understanding.
55. From it We created you, and into it We will 
return you, and from it We will bring you out 
another time.
56. We showed him Our signs, all of them, but 
he denied and refused.
57. He said, “Did you come to us to drive us 
out of our land with your magic, O Moses?
58. We will produce for you magic like it; so 
make an appointment between us and you, 
which we will not miss—neither us, nor 
you—in a central place.”
59. He said, “Your appointment is the day of 
the festival, so let the people be gathered to￾gether at mid-morning.”
60. Pharaoh turned away, put together his 
plan, and then came back.
61. Moses said to them, “Woe to you. Do not 
fabricate lies against Allah, or He will destroy 
you with a punishment. He who invents lies 
will fail.”
62. They disagreed among themselves over 
their affair, and conferred secretly.
63. They said, “These two are magicians who 
want to drive you out of your land with their 
magic, and to abolish your exemplary way of 
life.
64. So settle your plan, and come as one front. 
Today, whoever gains the upper hand will 
succeed.”
65. They said, “O Moses, either you throw, or 
we will be the first to throw.”
66. He said, “You throw.” And suddenly, their 
ropes and sticks appeared to him, because of 
their magic, to be crawling swiftly.
67. So Moses felt apprehensive within himself.
68. We said, “Do not be afraid, you are the up￾permost.
69. Now throw down what is in your right 
hand—it will swallow what they have crafted. 
What they have crafted is only a magician’s 
trickery. But the magician will not succeed, 
no matter what he does.”
70. And the magicians fell down prostrate. 
They said, “We have believed in the Lord of 
Aaron and Moses.”
71. He said, “Did you believe in him before I 
have given you permission? He must be your 
chief, who has taught you magic. I will cut off 
your hands and your feet on alternate sides, 
and I will crucify you on the trunks of the 
palm-trees. Then you will know which of us 
is more severe in punishment, and more last￾ing.”
72. They said, “We will not prefer you to the 
proofs that have come to us, and Him who 
created us. So issue whatever judgment you 
wish to issue. You can only rule in this lowly 
life.
116
20. TA-HA (Ta-Ha)
73. We have believed in our Lord, so that He 
may forgive us our sins, and the magic you 
have compelled us to practice. Allah is Better, 
and more Lasting.”
74. Whoever comes to his Lord guilty, for him 
is Hell, where he neither dies nor lives.
75. But whoever comes to Him a believer, hav￾ing worked righteousness—these will have 
the highest ranks.
76. The Gardens of Perpetuity, beneath which 
rivers flow, dwelling therein forever. That is 
the reward for him who purifies himself.
77. And We inspired Moses: “Travel by night 
with My servants, and strike for them a dry 
path across the sea, not fearing being over￾taken, nor worrying.”
78. Pharaoh pursued them with his troops, but 
the sea overwhelmed them, and completely 
engulfed them.
79. Pharaoh misled his people, and did not 
guide them.
80. O Children of Israel! We have delivered 
you from your enemy, and promised you by 
the right side of the Mount, and sent down to 
you manna and quails.
81. Eat of the good things We have provided 
for you, but do not be excessive therein, lest 
My wrath descends upon you. He upon 
whom My wrath descends has fallen.
82. And I am Forgiving towards him who re￾pents, believes, acts righteously, and then re￾mains guided.
83. “And what made you rush ahead of your 
people, O Moses?”
84. He said, “They are following in my foot￾steps; and I hurried on to You, my Lord, that 
you may be pleased.”
85. He said, “We have tested your people in 
your absence, and the Samarian misled 
them.”
86. So Moses returned to his people, angry and 
disappointed. He said, “O my people, did 
your Lord not promise you a good promise? 
Was the time too long for you? Or did you 
want wrath from your Lord to descend upon 
you, so you broke your promise to me?”
87. They said, “We did not break our promise 
to you by our choice, but we were made to 
carry loads of the people’s ornaments, and we 
cast them in. That was what the Samarian 
suggested.”
88. So he produced for them a calf—a mere 
body which lowed. And they said, “This is 
your god, and the god of Moses, but he has 
forgotten.”
89. Did they not see that it cannot return a 
word to them, and has no power to harm 
them or benefit them?
90.Aaron had said to them before, “O my peo￾ple, you are being tested by this. And your 
Lord is the Merciful, so follow me, and obey 
my command.”
91. They said, “We will not give up our devo￾tion to it, until Moses returns to us.”
92. He said, “O Aaron, what prevented you, 
when you saw them going astray.
93. From following me? Did you disobey my 
command?”
94. He said, “Son of my mother, do not seize 
me by my beard or my head. I feared you 
would say, `You have caused division among 
the Children of Israel, and did not regard my 
word.'“
95. He said, “What do you have to say, O Sa￾marian?”
96. He said, “I saw what they did not see, so I 
grasped a handful from the Messenger’s 
traces, and I flung it away. Thus my soul 
prompted me.”
97. He said, “Begone! Your lot in this life is to 
say, ‘No contact.’ And you have an appoint￾ment that you will not miss. Now look at your 
god that you remained devoted to—we will 
burn it up, and then blow it away into the sea, 
as powder.”
98. Surely your god is Allah, the One besides 
whom there is no other god. He compre￾hends everything in knowledge.
117
20. TA-HA (Ta-Ha)
99. Thus We narrate to you reports of times 
gone by; and We have given you a message 
from Our Presence. 
100. Whoever turns away from it will carry on 
the Day of Resurrection a burden.
101. Abiding therein forever. And wretched is 
their burden on the Day of Resurrection.
102. On the Day when the Trumpet is blown—
We will gather the sinners on that Day, blue.
103. Murmuring among themselves: “You have 
lingered only for ten.”
104. We are fully aware of what they say, when 
the most exemplary of them in conduct will 
say, “You have lingered only a day.”
105. And they ask you about the mountains. 
Say, “My Lord will crumble them utterly.”
106. And leave them desolate waste.
107. You will see in them neither crookedness, 
nor deviation.”
108. On that Day, they will follow the caller, 
without any deviation. Voices will be hushed 
before the Merciful, and you will hear noth￾ing but murmur. 
109. On that Day, intercession will not avail, 
except for him permitted by the Merciful, and 
whose words He has approved.
110. He knows what is before them and what is 
behind them, and they cannot comprehend 
Him in their knowledge.
111. Faces will be humbled before the Living, 
the Eternal. Whoever carries injustice will 
despair.
112. But whoever has done righteous deeds, 
while being a believer—will fear neither in￾justice, nor grievance.
113. Thus We have revealed it an Arabic 
Quran, and We have diversified the warnings 
in it, that perhaps they would become right￾eous, or it may produce a lesson for them.
114. Exalted is Allah, the True King. Do not be 
hasty with the Quran before its inspiration to 
you is concluded, and say, “My Lord, increase 
me in knowledge.”
115. And We covenanted with Adam before, 
but he forgot, and We found in him no re￾solve.
116. And when We said to the angels, “Bow 
down to Adam.” They bowed down, except 
for Satan; he refused.
117. We said, “O Adam, this is an enemy to you 
and to your wife. So do not let him make you 
leave the Garden, for then you will suffer.
118. In it you will never go hungry, nor be na￾ked.
119. Nor will you be thirsty in it, nor will you 
swelter.”
120. But Satan whispered to him. He said, “O 
Adam, shall I show you the Tree of Immor￾tality, and a kingdom that never decays?”
121. And so they ate from it; whereupon their 
bodies became visible to them, and they 
started covering themselves with the leaves of 
the Garden. Thus Adam disobeyed his Lord, 
and fell.
122. But then his Lord recalled him, and par￾doned him, and guided him.
123. He said, “Go down from it, altogether; 
some of you enemies of some others. But 
whenever guidance comes to you from Me, 
whoever follows My guidance, will not go 
astray, nor suffer.
124. But whoever turns away from My Re￾minder, for him is a confined life. And We 
will raise him on the Day of Resurrection 
blind.”
125. He will say, “My Lord, why did You raise 
me blind, though I was seeing?”
126. He will say, “Just as Our revelations came 
to you, and you forgot them, today you will 
be forgotten.”
127. Thus We recompense him who trans￾gresses and does not believe in the revelations 
of his Lord. The punishment of the Hereafter 
is more severe, and more lasting.
128. Is it not instructive to them, how many 
generations before them We destroyed, in 
118
21. THE PROPHETS (al-Anbiya)
whose settlements they walk? Surely in that 
are signs for people of understanding.
129. Were it not for a word that issued from 
your Lord, the inevitable would have hap￾pened, but there is an appointed term.
130. So bear patiently what they say, and cele￾brate the praises of your Lord before the ris￾ing of the sun, and before its setting. And 
during the hours of the night glorify Him, 
and at the borders of the day, that you may be 
satisfied.
131. And do not extend your glance towards 
what We have given some classes of them to 
enjoy—the splendor of the life of this world—
that We may test them thereby. Your Lord’s 
provision is better, and more lasting.
132. And exhort your people to pray, and pa￾tiently adhere to it. We ask of you no suste￾nance, but it is We who sustain you. The good 
ending is that for righteousness.
133. And they say, “Why does he not bring us 
a miracle from his Lord?” Were they not 
given enough miracles in the former scrip￾tures?
134. Had We destroyed them with a punish￾ment before him, they would have said, “Our 
Lord, if only You had sent us a messenger, we 
would have followed Your revelations before 
we were humiliated and disgraced.”
135. Say, “Everybody is waiting, so wait. You 
will know who the people of the straight path 
are, and who is rightly-guided.
21. THE PROPHETS
(al-Anbiya)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Mankind’s reckoning has drawn near, but 
they turn away heedlessly.
2. No fresh reminder comes to them from 
their Lord, but they listen to it playfully.
3. Their hearts distracted, the wrongdoers 
confer secretly, “Is this anything but a mortal 
like you? Will you take to sorcery, with open￾eyes?”
4. He said, “My Lord knows what is said in the 
heaven and the earth; and He is the Hearer, 
the Knower.”
5. And they said, “A jumble of dreams,” and, 
“He made it up,” and, “He is a poet,” “let him 
bring us a sign, like those sent to the an￾cients.”
6. None of the towns We destroyed before 
them had believed. Will they, then, believe?
7. We did not send before you except men, 
whom We inspired. Ask the people of 
knowledge, if you do not know.
8. We did not make them mere bodies that ate 
no food, nor were they immortal. 
9. Then We fulfilled Our promise to them, 
and We saved them together with whomever 
We willed, and We destroyed the extrava￾gant.
10. We have sent down to you a Book, contain￾ing your message. Do you not understand?
11. How many a guilty town have We crushed, 
and established thereafter another people?
12. Then, when they sensed Our might, they 
started running away from it.
13. Do not run, but come back to your luxu￾ries, and to your homes, that you may be 
questioned.
14. They said, “Woe to us; we were unfair.”
15. This continued to be their cry, until We 
made them silent ashes.
16. We did not create the sky and the earth and 
what is between them for amusement.
17. If We wanted amusement, We could have 
found it within Us, were We to do so.
18. In fact, We hurl the truth against falsehood, 
and it crushes it, so it vanishes. Woe unto 
you, for what you describe.
19. To Him belongs everyone in the heavens 
and the earth. Those near Him are not too 
proud to worship Him, nor do they waver.
119
21. THE PROPHETS (al-Anbiya)
20. They praise night and day, without ever tir￾ing.
21. Or have they taken to themselves gods 
from the earth who resurrect?
22. If there were in them gods other than Al￾lah, they would have gone to ruin. So glory be 
to Allah, Lord of the Throne, beyond what 
they allege.
23. He will not be questioned about what He 
does, but they will be questioned.
24. Or have they taken, besides Him, other 
gods? Say, “Bring your proof. This is a mes￾sage for those with me, and a message of 
those before me.” But most of them do not 
know the truth, so they turn away.
25. We never sent a messenger before you 
without inspiring him that: “There is no god 
but I, so worship Me.”
26. And they say, “The Most Merciful has 
taken to himself a son.” Be He glorified; they 
are but honored servants.
27. They never speak before He has spoken, 
and they only act on His command.
28. He knows what is before them, and what is 
behind them; and they do not intercede ex￾cept for him whom He approves; and they 
tremble in awe of Him.
29. And whoever of them says, “I am a god be￾sides Him,” We will reward him with Hell. 
Thus We reward the wrongdoers.
30. Do the disbelievers not see that the heavens 
and the earth were one mass, and We tore 
them apart? And We made from water every 
living thing. Will they not believe?
31. And We placed on earth stabilizers, lest it 
sways with them, and We placed therein 
signposts and passages, that they may be 
guided.
32. And We made the sky a protected ceiling; 
yet they turn away from its wonders. 
33. It is He who created the night and the day, 
and the sun and the moon; each floating in an 
orbit.
34. We did not grant immortality to any hu￾man being before you. Should you die, are 
they then the immortal?
35. Every soul will taste death. We burden you 
with adversity and prosperity—a test. And to 
Us you will be returned.
36. When those who disbelieve see you, they 
treat you only with ridicule: “Is this the one 
who mentions your gods?” And they reject 
the mention of the Merciful.
37. The human being was created of haste. I 
will show you My signs, so do not seek to rush 
Me.
38. And they say, “When will this promise 
come true, if you are truthful?”
39. If those who disbelieve only knew, when 
they cannot keep the fire off their faces and 
off their backs, and they will not be helped.
40. In fact, it will come upon them suddenly, 
and bewilder them. They will not be able to 
repel it, and they will not be reprieved.
41. Messengers before you were also ridiculed, 
but those who jeered were surrounded by 
what they had ridiculed.
42. Say, “Who guards you against the Merciful 
by night and by day?” But they turn away 
from the mention of their Lord.
43. Or do they have gods who can defend them 
against Us? They cannot help themselves, nor 
will they be protected from Us.
44. We have given these enjoyments, and their 
ancestors, until time grew long upon them. 
Do they not see how We gradually reduce the 
land from its extremities? Are they then the 
victors?
45. Say, “I am warning you through inspira￾tion.” But the deaf cannot hear the call when 
they are being warned.
46. And when a breath of your Lord’s punish￾ment touches them, they say, “Woe to us, we 
were truly wicked.”
47. We will set up the scales of justice for the 
Day of Resurrection, so that no soul will suf￾fer the least injustice. And even if it be the 
120
21. THE PROPHETS (al-Anbiya)
weight of a mustard-seed, We will bring it up. 
Sufficient are We as Reckoners.
48. We gave Moses and Aaron the Criterion, 
and illumination, and a reminder for the 
righteous.
49. Those who fear their Lord in private, and 
are apprehensive of the Hour.
50. This too is a blessed message that We re￾vealed. Are you going to deny it?
51. We gave Abraham his integrity formerly, 
and We knew him well.
52. When he said to his father and his people, 
“What are these statues to which you are de￾voted?”
53. They said, “We found our parents wor￾shiping them.”
54. He said, “You and your parents are in evi￾dent error.”
55. They said, “Are you telling us the truth, or 
are you just playing?”
56. He said, “Your Lord is the Lord of the 
heavens and the earth, the One who created 
them, and I bear witness to that.
57. “By Allah, I will have a plan for your statues 
after you have gone away.”
58. So he reduced them into pieces, except for 
their biggest, that they may return to it.
59. They said, “Who did this to our gods? He 
is certainly one of the wrongdoers.”
60. They said, “We heard a youth mentioning 
them. He is called Abraham.”
61. They said, “Bring him before the eyes of the 
people, so that they may witness.”
62. They said, “Are you the one who did this to 
our gods, O Abraham?”
63. He said, “But it was this biggest of them 
that did it. Ask them, if they can speak.”
64. Then they turned to one another, and said, 
“You yourselves are the wrongdoers.”
65. But they reverted to their old ideas: “You 
certainly know that these do not speak.”
66. He said, “Do you worship, instead of Allah, 
what can neither benefit you in anything, nor 
harm you?
67. Fie on you, and on what you worship in￾stead of Allah. Do you not understand?”
68. They said, “Burn him and support your 
gods, if you are going to act.”
69. We said, “O fire, be coolness and safety 
upon Abraham.”
70. They planned to harm him, but We made 
them the worst losers.
71. And We delivered him, and Lot, to the land 
that We blessed for all people.
72. And We granted him Isaac and Jacob as a 
gift; and each We made righteous.
73. And We made them leaders, guiding by 
Our command; and We inspired them to do 
good works, and to observe the prayer, and to 
give out charity. They were devoted servants 
to Us.
74. And Lot—We gave him judgment and 
knowledge, and We delivered him from the 
town that practiced the abominations. They 
were wicked and perverted people.
75. And We admitted him into Our mercy; for 
He was one of the righteous.
76. And Noah, when he called before. So We 
answered him, and delivered him and his 
family from the great disaster.
77. And We supported him against the people 
who rejected Our signs. They were an evil 
people, so We drowned them all.
78. And David and Solomon, when they gave 
judgment in the case of the field, when some 
people’s sheep wandered therein by night; 
and We were witnesses to their judgment.
79. And so We made Solomon understand it, 
and to each We gave wisdom and knowledge. 
And We subjected the mountains along with 
David to sing Our praises, and the birds as 
well—surely We did.
80. And We taught him the making of shields 
for you, to protect you from your violence. 
Are you, then, appreciative?
121
21. THE PROPHETS (al-Anbiya)
81. And to Solomon the stormy wind, blowing 
at His command towards the land that We 
have blessed. We are aware of everything.
82. And of the devils were some that dived for 
him, and performed other, lesser tasks. But 
We kept them restrained.
83. And Job, when he cried out to his Lord: 
“Great harm has afflicted me, and you are the 
Most Merciful of the merciful.”
84. So We answered him, lifted his suffering, 
and restored his family to him, and their like 
with them—a mercy from Us, and a reminder 
for the worshipers.
85. And Ishmael, and Enoch, and Ezekiel; each 
was one of the steadfast.
86. And We admitted them into Our mercy. 
They were among the righteous.
87. And Jonah, when he stormed out in fury, 
thinking We had no power over him. But 
then He cried out in the darkness, “There is 
no god but You! Glory to You! I was one of 
the wrongdoers!”
88. So We answered him, and saved him from 
the affliction. Thus We save the faithful.
89. And Zechariah, when he called out to his 
Lord, “My Lord, do not leave me alone, even 
though you are the Best of heirs.”
90. So We answered him, and gave him John. 
And We cured his wife for him. They used to 
vie in doing righteous deeds, and used to call 
on Us in love and awe, and they used to hum￾ble themselves to Us.
91. And she who guarded her virginity. We 
breathed into her of Our spirit, and made her 
and her son a sign to the world.
92. This community of yours is one commu￾nity, and I am your Lord, so worship Me.
93. But they splintered themselves into fac￾tions. They will all return to Us.
94. Whoever does righteous deeds, and is a be￾liever, his effort will not be denied. We are 
writing it down for him. 
95. There is a ban on the town that We had de￾stroyed—that they will not return.
96. Until, when Gog and Magog are let loose, 
and they swarm down from every mound.
97. The promise of truth has drawn near. The 
eyes of those who disbelieved will stare in 
horror: “Woe to us. We were oblivious to 
this. In fact, we were wrongdoers.”
98. You and what you worship besides Allah 
are fuel for Hell. You will descend into it.
99. Had these been gods, they would not have 
descended into it. All will abide in it.
100. In it they will wail. In it they will not hear.
101. As for those who deserved goodness from 
Us—these will be kept away from it.
102. They will not hear its hissing, and they will 
forever abide in what their hearts desire.
103. The Supreme Fear will not worry them, 
and the angels will receive them: “This is your 
Day which you were promised.”
104. On the Day when We fold the heaven, like 
the folding of a book. Just as We began the 
first creation, We will repeat it—a promise 
binding on Us. We will act.
105. We have written in the Psalms, after the 
Reminder, that the earth will be inherited by 
My righteous servants.
106. Indeed, in this is a message for people who 
worship.
107. We did not send you except as mercy to 
mankind.
108. Say, “It is revealed to me that your God is 
One God. Are you going to submit?”
109. But if they turn away, say, “I have in￾formed you sufficiently. Although I do not 
know whether what you are promised is near 
or far.”
110. He knows what is said openly, and He 
knows what you conceal.
111. “And I do not know whether it is perhaps 
a trial for you, and an enjoyment for a while.”
112. He said, “My Lord, judge with justice.” 
And, “Our Lord is the Gracious, Whose help 
is sought against what you allege.”
122
22. THE PILGRIMAGE (al-Hajj)
22. THE PILGRIMAGE
(al-Hajj)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. O people, be conscious of your Lord. The 
quaking of the Hour is a tremendous thing.
2. On the Day when you will see it: every nurs￾ing mother will discard her infant, and every 
pregnant woman will abort her load, and you 
will see the people drunk, even though they 
are not drunk—but the punishment of Allah 
is severe.
3. Among the people is he who argues about 
Allah without knowledge, and follows every 
defiant devil.
4. It was decreed for him, that whoever follows 
him—he will misguide him, and lead him to 
the torment of the Blaze.
5. O people! If you are in doubt about the Res￾urrection—We created you from dust, then 
from a small drop, then from a clinging clot, 
then from a lump of flesh, partly developed 
and partly undeveloped. In order to clarify 
things for you. And We settle in the wombs 
whatever We will for a designated term, and 
then We bring you out as infants, until you 
reach your full strength. And some of you will 
pass away, and some of you will be returned 
to the vilest age, so that he may not know, af￾ter having known. And you see the earth still; 
but when We send down water on it, it vi￾brates, and swells, and grows all kinds of 
lovely pairs.
6. That is because Allah is the truth, and be￾cause He gives life to the dead, and because 
He is Capable of everything.
7. And because the Hour is coming—there is 
no doubt about it—and because Allah will 
resurrect those in the graves.
8. And among the people is he who argues 
about Allah without knowledge, or guidance, 
or an enlightening scripture.
9. Turning aside in contempt, to lead away 
from the path of Allah. He will have humilia￾tion in this world, and on the Day of Resur￾rection We will make him taste the agony of 
burning.
10. That is for what your hands have advanced, 
and because Allah is not unjust to the serv￾ants.
11. And among the people is he who worships 
Allah on edge. When something good comes 
his way, he is content with it. But when an or￾deal strikes him, he makes a turnaround. He 
loses this world and the next. That is the ob￾vious loss.
12. He invokes, instead of Allah, what can nei￾ther harm him nor benefit him. That is the far 
straying.
13. He invokes one whose harm is closer than 
his benefit. What a miserable master. What a 
miserable companion.
14. Allah will admit those who believe and do 
righteous deeds into Gardens beneath which 
rivers flow. Allah does whatever He wills.
15. Whoever thinks that Allah will not help 
him in this life and in the Hereafter—let him 
turn to heaven, then sever, and see if his cun￾ning eliminates what enrages him.
16. Thus We revealed it as clarifying signs, and 
Allah guides whomever He wills.
17. Those who believe, and those who are Jew￾ish, and the Sabeans, and the Christians, and 
the Zoroastrians, and the Polytheists—Allah 
will judge between them on the Day of Res￾urrection. Allah is witness to all things.
18. Do you not realize that to Allah prostrates 
everyone in the heavens and everyone on 
earth, and the sun, and the moon, and the 
stars, and the mountains, and the trees, and 
the animals, and many of the people? But 
many are justly deserving of punishment. 
Whomever Allah shames, there is none to 
honor him. Allah does whatever He wills.
19. Here are two adversaries feuding regarding 
their Lord. As for those who disbelieve, gar￾ments of fire will be tailored for them, and 
123
22. THE PILGRIMAGE (al-Hajj)
scalding water will be poured over their 
heads.
20. Melting their insides and their skins.
21. And they will have maces of iron.
22. Whenever they try to escape the gloom, 
they will be driven back to it: “Taste the suf￾fering of burning.”
23. But Allah will admit those who believe and 
do good deeds into Gardens beneath which 
rivers flow. They will be decorated therein 
with bracelets of gold and pearls, and their 
garments therein will be of silk.
24. They were guided to purity of speech. They 
were guided to the path of the Most Praised.
25. As for those who disbelieve and repel from 
Allah’s path and from the Sacred Mosque—
which We have designated for all mankind 
equally, whether residing therein or passing 
through—and seek to commit sacrilege 
therein—We will make him taste of a painful 
punishment.
26. We showed Abraham the location of the 
House: “Do not associate anything with Me; 
and purify My House for those who circle 
around, and those who stand to pray, and 
those who kneel and prostrate.”
27. And announce the pilgrimage to human￾ity. They will come to you on foot, and on 
every transport. They will come from every 
distant point.
28. That they may witness the benefits for 
themselves, and celebrate the name of Allah 
during the appointed days, for providing 
them with the animal livestock. So eat from 
it, and feed the unfortunate poor.
29. Then let them perform their acts of cleans￾ing, and fulfill their vows, and circle around 
the Ancient House.
30. All that. Whoever venerates the sanctities 
of Allah—it is good for him with his Lord. All 
livestock are permitted to you, except what is 
recited to you. So stay away from the abomi￾nation of idols, and stay away from perjury.
31. Being true to Allah, without associating an￾ything with Him. Whoever associates any￾thing with Allah—it is as though he has fallen 
from the sky, and is snatched by the birds, or 
is swept away by the wind to a distant abyss.
32. So it is. Whoever venerates the sacraments 
of Allah—it is from the piety of the hearts.
33. In them are benefits for you until a certain 
time. Then their place is by the Ancient 
House.
34. We have appointed a rite for every nation, 
that they may commemorate Allah’s name 
over the livestock He has provided for them. 
Your God is One God, so to Him submit, and 
announce good news to the humble.
35. Those whose hearts tremble when Allah is 
mentioned, and those who endure what has 
befallen them, and those who perform the 
prayer and spend from what We have pro￾vided for them.
36. We have made the animal offerings em￾blems of Allah for you. In them is goodness 
for you. So pronounce Allah’s name upon 
them as they line up. Then, when they have 
fallen on their sides, eat of them and feed the 
contented and the beggar. Thus We have sub￾jected them to you, that you may be thankful.
37. Neither their flesh, nor their blood, ever 
reaches Allah. What reaches Him is the right￾eousness from you. Thus He subdued them 
to you, that you may glorify Allah for guiding 
you. And give good news to the charitable.
38. Allah defends those who believe. Allah 
does not love any ungrateful traitor.
39. Permission is given to those who are 
fought against, and Allah is Able to give them 
victory.
40. Those who were unjustly evicted from 
their homes, merely for saying, “Our Lord is 
Allah.” Were it not that Allah repels people 
by means of others: monasteries, churches, 
synagogues, and mosques—where the name 
of Allah is mentioned much—would have 
been demolished. Allah supports whoever 
supports Him. Allah is Strong and Mighty.
124
22. THE PILGRIMAGE (al-Hajj)
41. Those who, when We empower them in the 
land, observe the prayer, and give regular 
charity, and command what is right, and for￾bid what is wrong. To Allah belongs the out￾come of events.
42. If they deny you—before them the people 
of Noah, and Aad, and Thamood also denied.
43. And the people of Abraham, and the peo￾ple of Lot.
44. And the inhabitants of Median. And Moses 
was denied. Then I reprieved those who dis￾believed, but then I seized them. So how was 
My rejection?
45. How many a town have We destroyed 
while it was doing wrong? They lie in ruins; 
with stilled wells, and lofty mansions.
46. Have they not journeyed in the land, and 
had minds to reason with, or ears to listen 
with? It is not the eyes that go blind, but it is 
the hearts, within the chests, that go blind.
47. And they ask you to hasten the punish￾ment. But Allah never breaks His promise. A 
day with your Lord is like a thousand years of 
your count.
48. How many a town have I reprieved, alt￾hough it was unjust? Then I seized it. To Me 
is the destination.
49. Say, “O people, I am only a plain warner to 
you.”
50. Those who believe and work righteous￾ness—for them is forgiveness and a generous 
provision.
51. But those who strive against Our revela￾tions—these are the inmates of Hell.
52. We never sent a messenger before you, or 
a prophet, but when he had a desire Satan in￾terfered in his wishes. But Allah nullifies what 
Satan interjects, and Allah affirms His revela￾tions. Allah is Omniscient and Wise.
53. In order to make Satan’s suggestions a trial 
for those whose hearts are diseased, and those 
whose hearts are hardened. The wrongdoers 
are in profound discord.
54. And so that those endowed with 
knowledge may know that it is the truth from 
your Lord, and so believe in it, and their 
hearts soften to it. Allah guides those who be￾lieve to a straight path.
55. Those who disbelieve will continue to be 
hesitant about it, until the Hour comes upon 
them suddenly, or there comes to them the 
torment of a desolate Day.
56. Sovereignty on that Day belongs to Allah; 
He will judge between them. Those who be￾lieve and do good deeds will be in the Gar￾dens of Bliss.
57. But those who disbelieve and reject Our 
revelations—these will have a humiliating 
punishment.
58. Those who emigrate in Allah’s cause, then 
get killed, or die, Allah will provide them with 
fine provisions. Allah is the Best of Providers.
59. He will admit them an admittance that will 
please them. Allah is Knowing and Clement.
60. That is so! Whoever retaliates similarly to 
the affliction he was made to suffer, and then 
he is wronged again, Allah will definitely as￾sist him. Allah is Pardoning and Forgiving.
61. That is because Allah merges the night into 
the day, and He merges the day into the night,
and because Allah is Hearing and Seeing.
62. That is because Allah is the Reality, and 
what they invoke besides Him is vanity, and 
because Allah is the Sublime, the Grand.
63. Do you not see that Allah sends down wa￾ter from the sky, and the land becomes green? 
Allah is Kind and Aware.
64. To Him belongs everything in the heavens 
and everything on earth. Allah is the Rich, the 
Praised.
65. Do you not see that Allah made everything 
on earth subservient to you? How the ships 
sail at sea by His command? That He holds 
up the sky lest it falls on earth—except by His 
permission? Allah is Gracious towards the 
people, Most Merciful.
125
23. THE BELIEVERS (al-Mu’minun)
66. And it is He who gives you life, then makes 
you die, then revives you. The human being 
is unappreciative. 
67. For every congregation We have appointed 
acts of devotion, which they observe. So do 
not let them dispute with you in this matter. 
And invite to your Lord; you are upon a 
straight guidance.
68. But if they dispute with you, say, “Allah is 
fully aware of what you do.”
69. Allah will judge between you on the Day of 
Resurrection regarding what you disagree 
about.
70. Do you not know that Allah knows every￾thing in the heavens and the earth? This is in 
a book. That is easy for Allah.
71. Yet they worship, besides Allah, things for 
which He sent down no warrant, and what 
they have no knowledge of. There is no savior 
for the transgressors.
72. And when Our Clear Verses are recited to 
them, you will recognize disgust on the faces 
of those who disbelieve. They nearly assault 
those who recite to them Our Verses. Say, 
“Shall I inform you of something worse than 
that? The Fire! Allah has promised it to those 
who disbelieve. And what a wretched out￾come!”
73. O people! A parable is presented, so listen 
to it: Those you invoke besides Allah will 
never create a fly, even if they banded to￾gether for that purpose. And if the fly steals 
anything from them, they cannot recover it 
from it. Weak are the pursuer and the pur￾sued.
74. They do not value Allah as He should be 
valued. Allah is Strong and Powerful.
75. Allah chooses messengers from among the 
angels, and from among the people. Allah is 
Hearing and Seeing.
76. He knows what is before them, and what is 
behind them. To Allah all matters are re￾ferred.
77. O you who believe! Kneel, and prostrate, 
and worship your Lord, and do good deeds, 
so that you may succeed.
78. And strive for Allah, with the striving due 
to Him. He has chosen you, and has not bur￾dened you in religion—the faith of your fa￾ther Abraham. It is he who named you Mus￾lims before, and in this. So that the Messen￾ger may be a witness over you, and you may 
be witnesses over the people. So pray regu￾larly, and give regular charity, and cleave to 
Allah. He is your Protector. What an excel￾lent Protector, and what an excellent Helper.
23. THE BELIEVERS
(al-Mu’minun)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Successful are the believers.
2. Those who are humble in their prayers.
3. Those who avoid nonsense.
4. Those who work for charity.
5. Those who safeguard their chastity.
6. Except from their spouses, or their depend￾ents—for then they are free from blame.
7. But whoever seeks anything beyond that—
these are the transgressors.
8. Those who are faithful to their trusts and 
pledges.
9. Those who safeguard their prayers.
10. These are the inheritors.
11. Who will inherit Paradise, wherein they 
will dwell forever.
12. We created man from an extract of clay.
13. Then We made him a seed, in a secure re￾pository.
14. Then We developed the seed into a clot. 
Then We developed the clot into a lump. 
Then We developed the lump into bones. 
Then We clothed the bones with flesh. Then 
We produced it into another creature. Most 
Blessed is Allah, the Best of Creators.
126
23. THE BELIEVERS (al-Mu’minun)
15. Then, after that, you will die.
16. Then, on the Day of Resurrection, you will 
be resurrected.
17. We created above you seven pathways, and 
We are never heedless of the creation.
18. And We sent down water from the sky in 
proper quantity, and settled it in the ground, 
and We are Able to take it away.
19. With it We produce for you gardens of 
palms and vines, yielding abundant fruit for 
you to eat.
20. And a tree springing out of Mount Sinai, 
producing oil, and seasoning for those who 
eat.
21. And there is a lesson for you in livestock: 
We give you to drink from what is in their 
bellies, and you have many benefits in them, 
and from them you eat.
22. And on them, and on the ships, you are 
transported.
23. We sent Noah to his people. He said, “O 
my people, worship Allah, you have no deity 
other than Him. Will you not take heed?”
24. But the notables of his people, who disbe￾lieved, said, “This is nothing but a human like 
you, who wants to gain superiority over you. 
Had Allah willed, He would have sent down 
angels. We never heard of this from our fore￾fathers of old.
25. He is nothing but a man possessed. Just ig￾nore him for a while.”
26. He said, “My Lord, help me, for they have 
rejected me.” 
27. So We inspired him: “Build the Ark under 
Our observation and by Our inspiration. And 
when Our decree comes to pass, and the oven 
boils over, load into it two pairs of every kind, 
together with your family, except those of 
them against whom the word has already 
been pronounced. And do not speak to me 
concerning those who did wrong; for they are 
to be drowned.”
28. Then, when you and those with you are set￾tled in the Ark, say, “Praise be to Allah, who 
has saved us from the wrongdoing people.”
29. And say, “My Lord, land me with a blessed 
landing, as you are the best of transporters.”
30. Surely in that are signs. We are always test￾ing.
31. Then, after them, We established another 
generation.
32. And We sent among them a messenger 
from themselves: “Serve Allah. You have no 
god other than Him. Will you not be cau￾tious?”
33. But the dignitaries of his people, those who 
disbelieved and denied the meeting of the 
Hereafter, and We had indulged them in the 
present life, said, “This is nothing but a hu￾man like you; he eats what you eat, and he 
drinks what you drink.
34. If you obey a human being like yourselves, 
then you will be losers.
35. Does he promise you that when you have 
died and become dust and bones, you will be 
brought out?
36. Farfetched, farfetched is what you are 
promised.
37. There is nothing but our life in this world. 
We die, and we live, and we are not resur￾rected.
38. He is nothing but a man, making up lies 
about Allah. We have no faith in him.”
39. He said, “My Lord, help me, for they have 
rejected me.”
40. He said, “Soon they will be filled with re￾gret.”
41. Then the Blast struck them, justifiably, and 
We turned them into scum. So away with the 
wicked people.
42. Then, after them, We raised other genera￾tions.
43. No nation can advance its time, nor can 
they postpone it.
127
23. THE BELIEVERS (al-Mu’minun)
44. Then We sent Our messengers in succes￾sion. Every time a messenger came to his 
community, they called him a liar. So We 
made them follow one another, and made 
them history. So away with a people who do 
not believe.
45. Then We sent Moses and his brother Aa￾ron, with Our signs and a clear authority.
46. To Pharaoh and his nobles, but they turned 
arrogant. They were oppressive people.
47. They said, “Are we to believe in two mor￾tals like us, and their people are our slaves?”
48. So they called them liars, and thus were 
among those destroyed.
49. And We gave Moses the Scripture, that 
they may be guided.
50. And We made Mary’s son and his mother 
a sign, and We sheltered them on high 
ground with security and flowing springs.
51. O messengers, eat of the good things, and 
act with integrity. I am aware of what you do.
52. This nation of yours is one nation, and I 
am your Lord, so fear Me.
53. But they tore themselves into sects; each 
party happy with what they have.
54. So leave them in their bewilderment until 
a time.
55. Do they assume that, in furnishing them 
with wealth and children.
56. We race to give them the good things? In 
fact, they have no idea.
57. Those who, from awe of their Lord, are 
fearful.
58. And those who believe in their Lord’s 
Verses.
59. And those who associate no partners with 
their Lord.
60. And those who give what they give, while 
their hearts quake, knowing that to their Lord 
they will return.
61. It is they who race towards goodness. It is 
they who will reach it first.
62. We never burden any soul beyond its ca￾pacity. And with Us is a record that tells the 
truth, and they will not be wronged.
63. But their hearts are puzzled because of this; 
and they have deeds that do not conform to 
this, which they continue to perpetrate.
64. Until, when We seize the decadent among 
them with torment, they begin to groan.
65. Do not groan today. You will receive no 
help from Us.
66. My Verses were recited to you, but you 
turned back on your heels.
67. Arrogant towards it—talked nonsense 
about it—disregarded it.
68. Have they not pondered the Word? Or has 
there come to them what came not to their 
forefathers of old?
69. Or is it that they did not recognize their 
messenger, so they are denying him?
70. Or do they say, “He is possessed?” In fact, 
he brought them the truth, but most of them 
hate the truth.
71. If the truth conformed to their desires, the 
heavens, the earth, and everyone in them 
would have gone to ruin. In fact, We have 
given them their message, but they keep 
avoiding their message.
72. Or are you asking them for a payment? The 
revenue from your Lord is better, and He is 
the Best of providers.
73. You are inviting them to a straight path.
74. But those who do not believe in the Here￾after are swerving from the path.
75. Even if We had mercy on them, and re￾lieved their problems, they would still blindly 
persist in their defiance.
76. We have already gripped them with suffer￾ing, but they did not surrender to their Lord, 
nor did they humble themselves.
77. Until, when We have opened before them 
a gate of intense agony, at once they will des￾pair.
128
23. THE BELIEVERS (al-Mu’minun)
78. It is He who produced for you the hearing, 
and the eyesight, and the feelings. But little 
gratitude you show.
79. And it is He who multiplied you on earth, 
and to Him you will be gathered.
80. And it is He who gives life and brings 
death, and to Him is the alternation of night 
and day. Do you not understand?
81. But they say the like of what the ancients 
said.
82. They say, “After we have died, and become 
dust and bones, will we be resurrected?
83. We were promised this before—we and 
our ancestors—these are nothing but legends 
of the ancients.”
84. Say, “To whom does the earth belong, and 
everyone in it, if you happen to know?” 
85. They will say, “To Allah.” Say, “Will you 
not reflect?”
86. Say, “Who is the Lord of the seven heavens, 
and Lord of the Splendid Throne?”
87. They will say, “To Allah.” Say, “Will you 
not become righteous?”
88. Say, “In whose hand is the dominion of all 
things, and He protects and cannot be pro￾tected from, if you happen to know?”
89. They will say, “To Allah.” Say, “Then are 
you bewitched?”
90. In fact, We have given them the truth, and 
they are liars.
91. Allah has never begotten a son, nor is there 
any god besides Him. Otherwise, each god 
would have taken away what it has created, 
and some of them would have gained su￾premacy over others. Glory be to Allah, far 
beyond what they describe.
92. The Knower of the hidden and the mani￾fest. He is exalted, far above what they asso￾ciate.
93. Say, “My Lord, if You would show me what 
they are promised.
94. My Lord, do not place me among the 
wicked people.”
95. We are surely Able to show you what We 
promise them.
96. Repel evil by what is better. We are aware 
of what they describe.
97. And say, “My Lord, I seek refuge with You 
from the urgings of the devils.
98. And I seek refuge with You, my Lord, lest 
they become present.”
99. Until, when death comes to one of them, 
he says, “My Lord, send me back.
100. That I may do right in what I have ne￾glected.” By no means! It is just a word that 
he utters. And behind them is a barrier, until 
the Day they are resurrected.
101. When the Horn is blown, no relations be￾tween them will exist on that Day, and they 
will not ask after one another.
102. Those whose scales are heavy—those are 
the successful.
103. But those whose scales are light—those are 
they who have lost their souls; in Hell they 
will dwell forever.
104. The Fire lashes their faces, and therein 
they grimace.
105. “Were not My revelations recited to you, 
and you kept on rejecting them?”
106. They will say, “Our Lord, our wretched￾ness prevailed over us, and we were a people 
astray.
107. Our Lord! Bring us out of this. If we ever 
returned, we would truly be evil.”
108. He will say, “Be despised therein, and do 
not speak to Me.
109. There was a group of My servants who 
would say, `Our Lord, we have believed, so 
forgive us, and have mercy on us; You are the 
Best of the merciful.'
110. But you made them a target of ridicule, 
until they made you forget My remembrance; 
and you used to laugh at them.
111. Today, I have rewarded them for their en￾durance. They are the ones who are the tri￾umphant.”
129
24. THE LIGHT (an-Nur)
112. He will say, “How many years did you re￾main on earth?”
113. They will say, “We remained a day, or part 
of a day; but ask those who keep count.”
114. He will say, “You remained only for a little 
while, if you only knew.
115. Did you think that We created you in vain, 
and that to Us you will not be returned?”
116. So Exalted is Allah, the Ruler, the Real. 
There is no god except He, the Lord of the 
Noble Throne.
117. Whoever invokes another god besides Al￾lah—he has no proof thereof—his reckoning 
rests with his Lord. The disbelievers will not 
succeed.
118. And say, “My Lord, forgive and have 
mercy, for You are the Best of the merciful.”
24. THE LIGHT
(an-Nur)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. A chapter that We have revealed, and made 
obligatory, and revealed in it clear Verses, 
that you may take heed.
2. The adulteress and the adulterer—whip 
each one of them a hundred lashes, and let no 
pity towards them overcome you regarding 
Allah’s Law, if you believe in Allah and the 
Last Day. And let a group of believers witness 
their punishment.
3. The adulterer shall marry none but an adul￾teress or an idolatress; and the adulteress 
shall marry none but an adulterer or an idol￾ater. That has been prohibited for the believ￾ers.
4. Those who accuse chaste women, then can￾not bring four witnesses, whip them eighty 
lashes, and do not ever accept their testi￾mony. For these are the immoral.
5. Except for those who repent afterwards, and 
reform; for Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
6. As for those who accuse their own spouses, 
but have no witnesses except themselves, the 
testimony of one of them is equivalent to four 
testimonies, if he swears by Allah that he is 
truthful.
7. And the fifth time, that Allah’s curse be 
upon him, if he is a liar.
8. But punishment shall be averted from her, 
if she swears four times by Allah, that he is a 
liar.
9. And the fifth time, that Allah’s wrath be 
upon her, if he is truthful.
10. Were it not for Allah’s grace upon you, and 
His mercy, and that Allah is Conciliatory and 
Wise.
11. Those who perpetrated the slander are a 
band of you. Do not consider it bad for you, 
but it is good for you. Each person among 
them bears his share in the sin. As for him 
who played the major role—for him is a ter￾rible punishment.
12. Why, when you heard about it, the believ￾ing men and women did not think well of one 
another, and say, “This is an obvious lie”?
13. Why did they not bring four witnesses to 
testify to it? If they fail to bring the witnesses, 
then in Allah’s sight, they are liars.
14. Were it not for Allah’s favor upon you, and 
His mercy, in this world and the Hereafter, 
you would have suffered a great punishment 
for what you have ventured into.
15. When you rumored it with your tongues, 
and spoke with your mouths what you had no 
knowledge of, and you considered it trivial; 
but according to Allah, it is serious.
16. When you heard it, you should have said, 
“It is not for us to repeat this. By Your glory, 
this is a serious slander.”
17. Allah cautions you never to return to the 
like of it, if you are believers.
18. Allah explains the Verses to you. Allah is 
Knowing and Wise.
19. Those who love to see immorality spread 
among the believers—for them is a painful 
130
24. THE LIGHT (an-Nur)
punishment, in this life and in the Hereafter. 
Allah knows, and you do not know.
20. Were it not for Allah’s grace upon you, and 
His mercy, and that Allah is Clement and 
Merciful.
21. O you who believe! Do not follow Satan’s 
footsteps. Whoever follows Satan’s foot￾steps—he advocates obscenity and immoral￾ity. Were it not for Allah’s grace towards you, 
and His mercy, not one of you would have 
been pure, ever. But Allah purifies whomever 
He wills. Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.
22. Those of you who have affluence and 
means should not refuse to give to the rela￾tives, and the needy, and the emigrants for 
the sake of Allah. And let them pardon, and 
let them overlook. Do you not love for Allah 
to pardon you? Allah is All-Forgiving, Most 
Merciful.
23. Those who slander honorable, innocent, 
believing women are cursed in this life and in 
the Hereafter. They will have a terrible pun￾ishment.
24. On the Day when their tongues, and their 
hands, and their feet will testify against them 
regarding what they used to do.
25. On that Day, Allah will pay them their ac￾count in full, and they will know that Allah is 
the Evident Reality.
26. Bad women are for bad men, and bad men 
are for bad women, and good women are for 
good men, and good men are for good 
women. Those are acquitted of what they say. 
There is forgiveness for them, and a generous 
provision.
27. O you who believe! Do not enter homes 
other than your own, until you have asked 
permission and greeted their occupants. That 
is better for you, that you may be aware.
28. And if you find no one in them, do not en￾ter them until you are given permission. And 
if it is said to you, “Turn back,” then turn 
back. That is more proper for you. Allah is 
aware of what you do.
29. There is no blame on you for entering un￾inhabited houses, in which are belongings of 
yours. Allah knows what you reveal and what 
you conceal.
30. Tell the believing men to restrain their 
looks, and to guard their privates. That is 
purer for them. Allah is cognizant of what 
they do.
31. And tell the believing women to restrain 
their looks, and to guard their privates, and 
not display their beauty except what is appar￾ent thereof, and to draw their coverings over 
their breasts, and not expose their beauty ex￾cept to their husbands, their fathers, their 
husbands' fathers, their sons, their husbands' 
sons, their brothers, their brothers' sons, their 
sisters' sons, their women, what their right 
hands possess, their male attendants who 
have no sexual desires, or children who are 
not yet aware of the nakedness of women. 
And they should not strike their feet to draw 
attention to their hidden beauty. And repent 
to Allah, all of you believers, so that you may 
succeed.
32. And wed the singles among you, and those 
who are fit among your servants and maids. 
If they are poor, Allah will enrich them from 
His bounty. Allah is All-Encompassing, All￾Knowing.
33. And let those who do not find the means to 
marry abstain, until Allah enriches them 
from His bounty. If any of your servants wish 
to be freed, grant them their wish, if you rec￾ognize some good in them. And give them of 
Allah’s wealth which he has given you. And 
do not compel your girls to prostitution, 
seeking the materials of this life, if they desire 
to remain chaste. Should anyone compel 
them—after their compulsion, Allah is For￾giving and Merciful.
34. We have sent down to you clarifying reve￾lations, and examples of those who passed on 
before you, and advice for the righteous.
35. Allah is the Light of the heavens and the 
earth. The allegory of His light is that of a pil￾lar on which is a lamp. The lamp is within a 
glass. The glass is like a brilliant planet, fueled 
131
24. THE LIGHT (an-Nur)
by a blessed tree, an olive tree, neither eastern 
nor western. Its oil would almost illuminate, 
even if no fire has touched it. Light upon 
Light. Allah guides to His light whomever He 
wills. Allah thus cites the parables for the peo￾ple. Allah is cognizant of everything.
36. In houses which Allah has permitted to be 
raised, and His name is celebrated therein. 
He is glorified therein, morning and evening.
37. By men who neither trading nor commerce 
distracts them from Allah’s remembrance, 
and from performing the prayers, and from 
giving alms. They fear a Day when hearts and 
sights are overturned.
38. Allah will reward them according to the 
best of what they did, and He will increase 
them from His bounty. Allah provides for 
whomever He wills without reckoning.
39. As for those who disbelieve, their works are 
like a mirage in a desert. The thirsty assumes 
it is to be water. Until, when he has reached 
it, he finds it to be nothing, but there he finds 
Allah, Who settles his account in full. Allah is 
swift in reckoning.
40. Or like utter darkness in a vast ocean, cov￾ered by waves, above which are waves, above 
which is fog. Darkness upon darkness. If he 
brings out his hand, he will hardly see it. He 
to whom Allah has not granted a light has no 
light.
41. Do you not realize that Allah is glorified by 
whatever is in the heavens and the earth, and 
even by the birds in formation? Each knows 
its prayer and its manner of praise. Allah 
knows well what they do.
42. To Allah belongs the dominion of the 
heavens and the earth, and to Allah is the ul￾timate return.
43. Have you not seen how Allah propels the 
clouds, then brings them together, then piles 
them into a heap, and you see rain drops 
emerging from its midst? How He brings 
down loads of hail from the sky, striking with 
it whomever He wills, and diverting it from 
whomever He wills? The flash of its lighten￾ing almost snatches the sight away.
44. Allah alternates the night and the day. In 
that is a lesson for those who have insight.
45. Allah created every living creature from 
water. Some of them crawl on their bellies, 
and some walk on two feet, and others walk 
on four. Allah creates whatever He wills. Al￾lah is Capable of everything.
46. We sent down enlightening revelations, 
and Allah guides whomever He wills to a 
straight path.
47. And they say, “We have believed in Allah 
and the Messenger, and we obey,” but some 
of them turn away afterwards. These are not 
believers.
48. And when they are called to Allah and His 
Messenger, in order to judge between them, 
some of them refuse.
49. But if justice is on their side, they accept it 
willingly.
50. Is there sickness in their hearts? Or are they 
suspicious? Or do they fear that Allah may do 
them injustice? Or His Messenger? In fact, 
they themselves are the unjust.
51. The response of the believers, when they 
are called to Allah and His Messenger in or￾der to judge between them, is to say, “We 
hear and we obey.” These are the successful.
52. Whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, 
and fears Allah, and is conscious of Him—
these are the winners.
53. And they swear by Allah with their solemn 
oaths, that if you commanded them, they 
would mobilize. Say, “Do not swear. Obedi￾ence will be recognized. Allah is experienced 
with what you do.”
54. Say, “Obey Allah and obey the Messenger.” 
But if they turn away, then he is responsible 
for his obligations, and you are responsible 
for your obligations. And if you obey him, 
you will be guided. It is only incumbent on 
the Messenger to deliver the Clarifying Mes￾sage.
55. Allah has promised those of you who be￾lieve and do righteous deeds, that He will 
make them successors on earth, as He made 
132
25. THE CRITERION (al-Furqan)
those before them successors, and He will es￾tablish for them their religion—which He has 
approved for them—and He will substitute 
security in place of their fear. They worship 
Me, never associating anything with Me. But 
whoever disbelieves after that—these are the 
sinners.
56. Pray regularly, and give regular charity, 
and obey the Messenger, so that you may re￾ceive mercy.
57. Never think that those who disbelieve can 
escape on earth. Their place is the Fire; a mis￾erable destination.
58. O you who believe! Permission must be re￾quested by your servants and those of you 
who have not reached puberty. On three oc￾casions: before the Dawn Prayer, and at noon 
when you change your clothes, and after the 
Evening Prayer. These are three occasions of 
privacy for you. At other times, it is not 
wrong for you or them to intermingle with 
one another. Allah thus clarifies the revela￾tions for you. Allah is Knowledgeable and 
Wise.
59. When the children among you reach pu￾berty, they must ask permission, as those be￾fore them asked permission. Allah thus clari￾fies His revelations for you. Allah is Knowl￾edgeable and Wise.
60. Women past the age of childbearing, who 
have no desire for marriage, commit no 
wrong by taking off their outer clothing, pro￾vided they do not flaunt their finery. But to 
maintain modesty is better for them. Allah is 
Hearing and Knowing.
61. There is no blame on the blind, nor any 
blame on the lame, nor any blame on the sick, 
nor on yourselves for eating at your homes, 
or your fathers’ homes, or your mothers’ 
homes, or your brothers’ homes, or your sis￾ters’ homes, or the homes of your paternal 
uncles, or the homes of your paternal aunts, 
or the homes of your maternal uncles, or the 
homes of your maternal aunts, or those 
whose keys you own, or the homes of your 
friends. You commit no wrong by eating to￾gether or separately. But when you enter any 
home, greet one another with a greeting from 
Allah, blessed and good. Allah thus explains 
the revelations for you, so that you may un￾derstand.
62. The believers are those who believe in Al￾lah and His Messenger, and when they are 
with him for a matter of common interest, 
they do not leave until they have asked him 
for permission. Those who ask your permis￾sion are those who believe in Allah and His 
Messenger. So when they ask your permis￾sion to attend to some affair of theirs, give 
permission to any of them you wish, and ask 
Allah’s forgiveness for them. Allah is Forgiv￾ing and Merciful.
63. Do not address the Messenger in the same 
manner you address one another. Allah 
knows those of you who slip away using 
flimsy excuses. So let those who oppose his 
orders beware, lest an ordeal strikes them, or 
a painful punishment befalls them.
64. Surely, to Allah belongs everything in the 
heavens and the earth. He knows what you 
are about. And on the Day they are returned 
to Him, He will inform them of what they 
did. Allah has full knowledge of all things.
25. THE CRITERION
(al-Furqan)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Blessed is He who sent down the Criterion 
upon His servant, to be a warning to human￾ity.
2. He to whom belongs the kingdom of the 
heavens and the earth, who took to Himself 
no son, who never had a partner in His king￾ship; who created everything and determined 
its measure.
3. And yet, instead of Him, they produce for 
themselves gods that create nothing, but are 
themselves created; that have no power to 
harm or benefit themselves; and no power 
over life, death, or resurrection.
133
25. THE CRITERION (al-Furqan)
4. Those who disbelieve say, “This is nothing 
but a lie that he made up, and others have 
helped him at it.” They have committed an 
injustice and a perjury.
5. And they say, “Tales of the ancients; he 
wrote them down; they are dictated to him 
morning and evening.”
6. Say, “It was revealed by He who knows the 
Secret in the heavens and the earth. He is al￾ways Forgiving and Merciful.”
7. And they say, “What sort of messenger is 
this, who eats food, and walks in the market￾places? If only an angel was sent down with 
him, to be alongside him a warner.”
8. Or, “If only a treasure was dropped on 
him.” Or, “If only he had a garden from 
which he eats.” The evildoers also say, “You 
are following but a man under spell.”
9. Look how they invent examples for you. 
They have gone astray, and cannot find a 
way.
10. Blessed is He who, if He wills, can provide 
you with better than that—gardens beneath 
which rivers flow—and He will give you pal￾aces.
11. In fact, they have denied the Hour, and We 
have prepared for those who deny the Hour a 
Blaze.
12. When it sees them from a distant place, 
they will hear it raging and roaring.
13. And when they are thrown into it, into a 
tight place, shackled, they will plead there for 
death.
14. “Do not plead for one death today, but 
plead for a great many deaths.”
15. Say, “Is this better, or the Garden of Eter￾nity promised to the righteous? It is for them 
a reward and a destination.
16. They will have therein whatever they de￾sire, forever. That is upon your Lord a bind￾ing promise.
17. On the Day when He gathers them, and 
what they worshiped besides Allah, He will 
say, “Was it you who misled these servants of 
Mine, or was it they who lost the way?”
18. They will say, “Glory be to You. It was not 
for us to take any lords besides You. But you 
gave them enjoyments, and their ancestors, 
until they forgot the Message, and became ru￾ined people.”
19. They have denied you because of what you 
say; so you can neither avert, nor help. Who￾ever among you commits injustice, We will 
make him taste a grievous punishment.
20. We never sent any messengers before you, 
but they ate food and walked in the market￾places. And We made some of you tempters 
for one another—will you be patient? Your 
Lord is always Observing.
21. Those who do not expect to meet Us say, 
“If only the angels were sent down to us, or 
we could see our Lord.” They have grown ar￾rogant within themselves, and have become 
excessively defiant.
22. On the Day when they see the angels—
there will be no good news for sinners on that 
Day; and they will say, “A protective refuge.”
23. We will proceed to the works they did, and 
will turn them into scattered dust.
24. The companions of Paradise on that Day 
will be better lodged, and more fairly accom￾modated.
25. The Day when the sky is cleft with clouds, 
and the angels are sent down in streams.
26. On that Day, true sovereignty will belong 
to the Merciful, and it will be a difficult Day 
for the disbelievers.
27. On that Day, the wrongdoer will bite his 
hands, and say, “If only I had followed the 
way with the Messenger.
28. Oh, woe to me; I wish I never took so-and￾so for a friend.
29. He led me away from the Message after it 
had come to me; for Satan has always been a 
betrayer of man.”
30. And the Messenger will say, “My Lord, my 
people have abandoned this Quran.”
134
25. THE CRITERION (al-Furqan)
31. Likewise, to every prophet We assign ene￾mies from among the wicked. But your Lord 
suffices as a Guide and Savior.
32. Those who disbelieve say, “Why was the 
Quran not revealed to him at once?” Thus in 
order to strengthen your heart thereby, and 
We revealed it in stages.
33. Whatever argument they come to you 
with, We provide you with the truth, and a 
better exposition.
34. Those who are herded into Hell on their 
faces—those are in a worse position, and fur￾ther astray from the way.
35. We gave Moses the Scripture, and ap￾pointed his brother Aaron as his assistant.
36. We said, “Go to the people who rejected 
Our signs,” and We destroyed them com￾pletely.
37. And the people of Noah: when they re￾jected the messengers, We drowned them, 
and made them a lesson for mankind. We 
have prepared for the wrongdoers a painful 
retribution.
38. And Aad, and Thamood, and the inhabit￾ants of Arras, and many generations in be￾tween.
39. To each We presented the parables; and 
each We devastated utterly.
40. And they came upon the city that was 
drenched by the terrible rain. Did they not 
see it? But they do not expect resurrection.
41. And when they see you, they take you for 
nothing but mockery: “Is this the one Allah 
sent as a messenger?”
42. “He nearly led us away from our gods, had 
we not patiently adhered to them.” But they 
will know, when they witness the torment, 
who is further away from the way.
43. Have you seen him who chose his desire as 
his god? Would you be an agent for him?
44. Or do you assume that most of them hear 
or understand? They are just like cattle, but 
even more errant in their way.
45. Do you not see how your Lord extends the 
shadow? Had He willed, He could have made 
it still. And We made the sun a pointer to it.
46. Then We withdraw it towards Us gradu￾ally.
47. And it is He who made the night a covering 
for you, and sleep for rest; and He made the 
day a revival.
48. And it is He who sends the winds, bringing 
advance news of His mercy; and We send 
down from the sky pure water.
49. To revive dead lands thereby, and to pro￾vide drink for the multitude of animals and 
humans We created.
50. We have circulated it among them, that 
they may reflect, but most people persist in 
thanklessness.
51. Had We willed, We could have sent to 
every town a warner.
52. So do not obey the disbelievers, but strive 
against them with it, a mighty struggle.
53. And it is He who merged the two seas; this 
one fresh and sweet, and that one salty and 
bitter; and He placed between them a barrier, 
and an impassable boundary.
54. And it is He who, from fluid, created the 
human being. Then He made relationships 
through marriage and mating. Your Lord is 
Omnipotent.
55. And yet, instead of Allah, they serve what 
neither profits them nor harms them. The 
disbeliever has always turned his back on his 
Lord.
56. We sent you only as a herald of good news 
and a warner. 
57. Say, “I ask of you no payment for this—
only that whoever wills may take a path to his 
Lord.”
58. And put your trust in the Living, the One 
who never dies; and celebrate His praise. He 
suffices as the All-Informed Knower of the 
faults of His creatures.
59. He who created the heavens and the earth 
and everything between them in six days, 
135
26. THE POETS (ash-Shu’ara’)
then settled on the Throne. The Most Merci￾ful. Ask about Him a well-informed.
60. And when it is said to them, “Bow down to 
the Merciful,” they say, “And what is the 
Merciful? Are we to bow down to whatever 
you command us?” And it increases their 
aversion.
61. Blessed is He who placed constellations in 
the sky, and placed in it a lamp, and an illu￾minating moon.
62. And it is He who made the night and the 
day alternate—for whoever desires to reflect, 
or desires to show gratitude.
63. The servants of the Merciful are those who 
walk the earth in humility, and when the ig￾norant address them, they say, “Peace.”
64. And those who pass the night prostrating 
themselves to their Lord and standing up.
65. And those who say, ‘‘Our Lord, avert from 
us the suffering of Hell, for its suffering is 
continuous.
66. It is indeed a miserable residence and des￾tination.”
67. And those who, when they spend, are nei￾ther wasteful nor stingy, but choose a middle 
course between that.
68. And those who do not implore besides Al￾lah any other god, and do not kill the soul 
which Allah has made sacred—except in the 
pursuit of justice—and do not commit adul￾tery. Whoever does that will face penalties.
69. The punishment will be doubled for him 
on the Day of Resurrection, and he will dwell 
therein in humiliation forever.
70. Except for those who repent, and believe, 
and do good deeds. These—Allah will replace 
their bad deeds with good deeds. Allah is ever 
Forgiving and Merciful.
71. Whoever repents and acts righteously—
has inclined towards Allah with repentance.
72. And those who do not bear false witness; 
and when they come across indecencies, they 
pass by with dignity.
73. And those who, when reminded of the rev￾elations of their Lord, do not fall before them 
deaf and blind.
74. And those who say, “Our Lord, grant us de￾light in our spouses and our children, and 
make us a good example for the righteous.”
75. Those will be awarded the Chamber for 
their patience, and will be greeted therein 
with greetings and peace.
76. Abiding therein forever—it is an excellent 
residence and destination.
77. Say, “What are you to my Lord without 
your prayers? You have denied the truth, and 
the inevitable will happen.”
26. THE POETS
(ash-Shu’ara’)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Ta, Seen, Meem.
2. These are the Verses of the Clarifying Book.
3. Perhaps you will destroy yourself with grief, 
because they do not become believers.
4. If We will, We can send down upon them a 
sign from heaven, at which their necks will 
stay bent in humility.
5. No fresh reminder comes to them from the 
Most Merciful, but they turn their backs at it.
6. They have denied the truth, but soon will 
come to them the news of what they ridi￾culed.
7. Have they not seen the earth, and how 
many beautiful pairs We produced therein?
8. Surely in this is a sign, but most of them are 
not believers.
9. Most surely, your Lord is the Almighty, the 
Merciful.
10. Your Lord called to Moses, “Go to the ty￾rannical people.
11. The people of Pharaoh. Will they not fear?”
136
26. THE POETS (ash-Shu’ara’)
12. He said, “My Lord, I fear they will reject 
me.
13. And I become stressed, and my tongue is 
not fluent, so send Aaron too.
14. And they have a charge against me, so I fear 
they will kill me.”
15. He said, “No. Go, both of you, with Our 
proofs. We will be with you, listening.
16. Go to Pharaoh, and say, ‘We are the Mes￾sengers of the Lord of the Worlds.
17. Let the Children of Israel go with us.'“
18. He said, “Did we not raise you among us as 
a child, and you stayed among us for many of 
your years?
19. And you committed that deed you com￾mitted, and you were ungrateful.”
20. He said, “I did it then, when I was of those 
astray.
21. And I fled from you when I feared you; but 
my Lord gave me wisdom, and made me one 
of the messengers.
22. Is that the favor you taunt me with, alt￾hough you have enslaved the Children of Is￾rael?”
23. Pharaoh said, “And what is the Lord of the 
Worlds?”
24. He said, “The Lord of the heavens and the 
earth, and everything between them, if you 
are aware.”
25. He said to those around him, “Do you not 
hear?”
26. He said, “Your Lord and the Lord of your 
ancestors of old.”
27. He said, “This messenger of yours, who is 
sent to you, is crazy.”
28. He said, “Lord of the East and the West, 
and everything between them, if you under￾stand.”
29. He said, “If you accept any god other than 
me, I will make you a prisoner.”
30. He said, “What if I bring you something 
convincing?”
31. He said, “Bring it, if you are being truthful.”
32. So he cast his staff; and it was a serpent, 
plain to see.
33. And he pulled his hand; and it was white, 
for all to see.
34. He said to the dignitaries around him, 
“This is a skilled magician.
35. He intends to drive you out of your land 
with his magic, so what do you recommend?”
36. They said, “Delay him and his brother, and 
send recruiters to the cities.
37. To bring you every experienced magician.”
38. So the magicians were gathered for the ap￾pointment on a specified day.
39. And it was said to the people, “Are you all 
gathered?
40. That we may follow the magicians, if they 
are the winners.”
41. When the magicians arrived, they said to 
Pharaoh, “Is there a reward for us, if we are 
the winners?”
42. He said, “Yes, and you will be among those 
favored.”
43. Moses said to them, “Present what you in￾tend to present.”
44. So they threw their ropes and their sticks, 
and said, “By the majesty of Pharaoh, we will 
be the winners.”
45. Then Moses threw his staff, and behold, it 
began swallowing their trickery.
46. And the magicians fell down prostrating.
47. They said, “We have believed in the Lord 
of the Worlds.
48. The Lord of Moses and Aaron.”
49. He said, “Did you believe in Him before I 
have given you permission? He must be your 
chief, who taught you magic. You will soon 
know. I will cut off your hands and feet on 
opposite sides, and I will crucify you all.”
50. They said, “No problem. To our Lord we 
will return.
137
26. THE POETS (ash-Shu’ara’)
51. We are eager for our Lord to forgive us our 
sins, since we are the first of the believers.”
52. And We inspired Moses: “Travel with My 
servants by night. You will be followed.”
53. Pharaoh sent heralds to the cities.
54. “These are a small gang.
55. And they are enraging us.
56. But we are a vigilant multitude.”
57. So We drove them out of gardens and 
springs.
58. And treasures and noble dwellings.
59. So it was. And We made the Children of 
Israel inherit them.
60. And they pursued them at sunrise.
61. When the two groups sighted each other, 
the followers of Moses said, “We are being 
overtaken.”
62. He said, “No; my Lord is with me, He will 
guide me.”
63. We inspired Moses: “Strike the sea with 
your staff.” Whereupon it parted, and each 
part was like a huge hill.
64. And there We brought the others near.
65. And We saved Moses and those with him, 
all together.
66. Then We drowned the others.
67. In that there is a sign, but most of them are 
not believers.
68. Surely, your Lord is the Almighty, the Mer￾ciful.
69. And relate to them the story of Abraham.
70. When he said to his father and his people, 
“What do you worship?”
71. They said, “We worship idols, and we re￾main devoted to them.”
72. He said, “Do they hear you when you pray?
73. Or do they benefit you, or harm you?”
74. They said, “But we found our ancestors do￾ing so.” 
75. He said, “Have you considered what you 
worship.
76. You and your ancient ancestors?
77. They are enemies to me, but not so the 
Lord of the Worlds.
78. He who created me, and guides me.
79. He who feeds me, and waters me.
80. And when I get sick, He heals me.
81. He who makes me die, and then revives me.
82. He who, I hope, will forgive my sins on the 
Day of the Reckoning.”
83. “My Lord! Grant me wisdom, and include 
me with the righteous.
84. And give me a reputation of truth among 
the others.
85. And make me of the inheritors of the Gar￾den of Bliss.
86. And forgive my father—he was one of the 
misguided.
87. And do not disgrace me on the Day they 
are resurrected.
88. The Day when neither wealth nor children 
will help.
89. Except for him who comes to Allah with a 
sound heart.”
90. And Paradise will be brought near for the 
righteous.
91. And the Blaze will be displayed to the devi￾ators.
92. And it will be said to them, “Where are 
those you used to worship?”
93. Besides Allah? Can they help you, or help 
themselves?”
94. Then they will be toppled into it, together 
with the seducers.
95. And the soldiers of Satan, all of them. 
96. They will say, as they feud in it.
97. “By Allah, We were in evident error.
98. For equating you with the Lord of the 
Worlds.
138
26. THE POETS (ash-Shu’ara’)
99. No one misled us except the sinners.
100. Now we have no intercessors.
101. And no sincere friend.
102. If only we could have another chance, we 
would be among the faithful.”
103. Surely in this is a sign, but most of them 
are not believers.
104. Your Lord is the Almighty, the Merciful.
105. The people of Noah disbelieved the mes￾sengers.
106. Their brother Noah said to them, “Do you 
not fear?
107. I am to you a faithful messenger.
108. So fear Allah, and obey me.
109. I ask of you no payment for this. My pay￾ment is only from the Lord of the Worlds.
110. So fear Allah, and obey me.”
111. They said, “Shall we believe in you, when 
it is the lowliest who follow you?”
112. He said, “What do I know about what they 
do?
113. Their account rests only with my Lord, if 
you have sense.
114. And I am not about to drive away the be￾lievers.
115. I am only a clear warner.”
116. They said, “If you do not refrain, O Noah, 
you will be stoned.”
117. He said, “My Lord, my people have denied 
me.
118. So judge between me and them decisively, 
and deliver me and the believers who are with 
me.
119. So We delivered him and those with him 
in the laden Ark.
120. Then We drowned the rest.
121. In that is a sign, but most of them are not 
believers.
122. Your Lord is the Almighty, the Merciful.
123. Aad disbelieved the messengers.
124. When their brother Hud said to them, “Do 
you not fear?
125. I am to you a faithful messenger.
126. So fear Allah, and obey me.
127. I ask of you no payment for this. My pay￾ment is only from the Lord of the Worlds.
128. Do you build a monument on every height 
for vanity's sake?
129. And you set up fortresses, hoping to live 
forever?
130. And when you strike, you strike merci￾lessly?
131. So fear Allah, and obey me.
132. And reverence Him, who supplied you 
with everything you know. 
133. He supplied you with livestock and chil￾dren.
134. And gardens and springs.
135. I fear for you the punishment of an awe￾some Day.”
136. They said, “It is the same for us, whether 
you lecture us, or do not lecture.
137. This is nothing but morals of the ancients.
138. And we will not be punished.”
139. So they denied him, and We destroyed 
them. Surely in this is a sign, but most of 
them are not believers.
140. Your Lord is the Almighty, the Merciful.
141. Thamood disbelieved the messengers.
142. When their brother Saleh said to them, 
“Do you not fear?
143. I am to you a faithful messenger.
144. So fear Allah, and obey me.
145. I ask of you no payment for it. My pay￾ment is only from the Lord of the Worlds.
146. Will you be left secure in what is here?
147. In gardens and springs?
148. And fields, and palm-trees whose fruits 
are delicious?
139
26. THE POETS (ash-Shu’ara’)
149. And you skillfully carve houses in the 
mountains?
150. So fear Allah, and obey me.
151. And do not obey the command of the ex￾travagant.
152. Who spread turmoil on earth, and do not 
reform.”
153. They said, “You are surely one of the be￾witched.
154. You are nothing but a man like us. So 
bring us a sign, if you are truthful.
155. He said, “This is a she-camel; she has her 
turn of drinking, and you have your turn of 
drinking—on a specified day.
156. And do not touch her with harm, lest the 
punishment of a great day seizes you.”
157. But they slaughtered her, and became full 
of remorse.
158. So the punishment overtook them. Surely 
in this is a sign, but most of them are not be￾lievers.
159. Your Lord is the Almighty, the Merciful.
160. The people of Lot disbelieved the messen￾gers.
161. When their brother Lot said to them, “Do 
you not fear?
162. I am to you a faithful messenger.
163. So fear Allah, and obey me.
164. I ask of you no payment for it. My pay￾ment is only from the Lord of the Worlds.
165. Do you approach the males of the world?
166. And forsake the wives your Lord created 
for you? Indeed, you are intrusive people.”
167. They said, “Unless you refrain, O Lot, you 
will be expelled.”
168. He said, “I certainly deplore your con￾duct.”
169. “My Lord, save me and my family from 
what they do.”
170. So We saved him and his family, alto￾gether.
171. Except for an old woman among those 
who tarried.
172. Then We destroyed the others.
173. And We rained down on them a rain. 
Dreadful is the rain of those forewarned.
174. Surely in this is a sign, but most of them 
are not believers.
175. Your Lord is the Almighty, the Merciful.
176. The People of the Woods disbelieved the 
messengers.
177. When Shuaib said to them, “Do you not 
fear?
178. I am to you a trustworthy messenger.
179. So fear Allah, and obey me.
180. I ask of you no payment for it. My pay￾ment is only from the Lord of the Worlds.
181. Give full measure, and do not cheat.
182. And weigh with accurate scales.
183. And do not defraud people of their be￾longings, and do not work corruption in the 
land.
184. And fear Him who created you and the 
masses of old.”
185. They said, “You are one of those be￾witched.
186. And you are nothing but a man like us; 
and we think that you are a liar.
187. So bring down on us pieces from the sky, 
if you are truthful.”
188. He said, “My Lord is Well Aware of what 
you do.”
189. But they denied him. So the punishment 
of the day of gloom gripped them. It was the 
punishment of a great day.
190. Surely in this is a sign, but most of them 
are not believers.
191. Your Lord is the Almighty, the Merciful.
192. It is a revelation from the Lord of the 
Worlds.
193. The Honest Spirit came down with it.
140
27. THE ANT (an-Naml)
194. Upon your heart, that you may be one of 
the warners.
195. In a clear Arabic tongue.
196. And it is in the scriptures of the ancients.
197. Is it not a sign for them that the scholars 
of the Children of Israel recognized it?
198. Had We revealed it to one of the foreign￾ers.
199. And he had recited it to them, they still 
would not have believed in it.
200. Thus We make it pass through the hearts 
of the guilty.
201. They will not believe in it until they wit￾ness the painful punishment.
202. It will come to them suddenly, while they 
are unaware.
203. Then they will say, “Are we given any res￾pite?”
204. Do they seek to hasten Our punishment?
205. Have you considered: if We let them enjoy 
themselves for some years.
206. Then there comes to them what they were 
promised.
207. Of what avail to them will be their past en￾joyments? 
208. Never did We destroy a town, but it had 
warners.
209. As a reminder—We are never unjust.
210. It was not the devils that revealed it.
211. It is not in their interests, nor in their 
power.
212. They are barred from hearing.
213. So do not pray to another god with Allah, 
else you will be of those tormented.
214. And warn your close relatives.
215. And lower your wing to those of the be￾lievers who follow you.
216. And if they disobey you, say, “I am inno￾cent of what you do.”
217. And put your trust in the Almighty, the 
Merciful.
218. He Who sees you when you rise.
219. And your devotions amidst the wor￾shipers.
220. He is indeed the Hearer, the Aware.
221. Shall I inform you upon whom the devils 
descend?
222. They descend upon every sinful liar.
223. They give ear, and most of them are liars.
224. And as for the poets—the deviators follow 
them.
225. Do you not see how they ramble in every 
style?
226. And how they say what they do not do?
227. Except for those who believe, and do good 
deeds, and remember Allah frequently, and 
defend themselves after they are wronged. As 
for those who do wrong, they will know by 
what overturning they will be overturned.
27. THE ANT
(an-Naml)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Ta, Seen. These are the Signs of the Quran—
a book that makes things clear.
2. Guidance and good news for the believers.
3. Those who observe the prayers, and give 
charity regularly, and are certain of the Here￾after.
4. As for those who do not believe in the Here￾after: We made their deeds appear good to 
them, so they wander aimlessly.
5. It is they who will receive the grievous pun￾ishment—and in the Hereafter they will be 
the greatest losers.
6. You are receiving the Quran from an All￾Wise, All-Knowing.
7. When Moses said to his family, “I have 
glimpsed a fire. I will bring you some news 
from it; or bring you a firebrand, that you 
may warm yourselves.”
141
27. THE ANT (an-Naml)
8. Then, when he reached it, he was called: 
“Blessed is He who is within the fire, and He 
who is around it, and glorified be Allah, Lord 
of the Worlds.
9. O Moses, it is I, Allah, the Almighty, the 
Wise.
10. Throw down your staff.” But when he saw 
it quivering, as though it were a demon, he 
turned around not looking back. “O Moses, 
do not fear; the messengers do not fear in My 
presence.
11. But whoever has done wrong, and then 
substituted goodness in place of evil. I am 
Forgiving and Merciful.
12. Put your hand inside your pocket, and it 
will come out white, without blemish—
among nine miracles to Pharaoh and his peo￾ple, for they are immoral people.”
13. Yet when Our enlightening signs came to 
them, they said, “This is obvious witchcraft.”
14. And they rejected them, although their 
souls were certain of them, out of wickedness 
and pride. So see how the outcome was for 
the mischief-makers.
15. And We gave David and Solomon 
knowledge. They said, “Praise Allah, who has 
favored us over many of His believing serv￾ants.”
16. And Solomon succeeded David. He said, 
“O people, we were taught the language of 
birds, and we were given from everything. 
This is indeed a real blessing.”
17. To the service of Solomon were mobilized 
his troops of sprites, and men, and birds—all 
held in strict order.
18. Until, when they came upon the Valley of 
Ants, an ant said, “O ants! Go into your nests, 
lest Solomon and his troops crush you with￾out noticing.”
19. He smiled and laughed at her words, and 
said, “My Lord, direct me to be thankful for 
the blessings you have bestowed upon me 
and upon my parents, and to do good works 
that please You. And admit me, by Your 
grace, into the company of Your virtuous 
servants.”
20. Then he inspected the birds, and said, 
“Why do I not see the hoopoe? Or is he 
among the absentees?
21. I will punish him most severely, or slay 
him, unless he gives me a valid excuse.”
22. But he did not stay for long. He said, “I 
have learnt something you did not know. I 
have come to you from Sheba, with reliable 
information.
23. I found a woman ruling over them, and she 
was given of everything, and she has a mag￾nificent throne.
24. I found her and her people worshiping the 
sun, instead of Allah. Satan made their con￾duct appear good to them, and diverted them 
from the path, so they are not guided.
25. If only they would worship Allah, who 
brings to light the mysteries of the heavens 
and the earth, and knows what you conceal 
and what you reveal.
26. Allah—There is no god but He, the Lord 
of the Sublime Throne.”
27. He said, “We will see, whether you have 
spoken the truth, or whether you are a liar.
28. Go with this letter of mine, and deliver it to 
them; then withdraw from them, and see how 
they respond.”
29. She said, “O Counselors, a gracious letter 
was delivered to me.
30. It is from Solomon, and it is, ‘In the Name 
of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful.
31. Do not defy me, and come to me submis￾sively.’”
32. She said, “O counselors, advise me in this 
matter of mine. I never make a decision un￾less you are present.”
33. They said, “We are a people of might and 
great courage, but the decision is yours, so 
consider what you wish to command.”
34. She said, “When kings enter a city, they 
devastate it, and subjugate its dignified peo￾ple. Thus they always do.
142
27. THE ANT (an-Naml)
35. I am sending them a gift, and will see what 
the envoys bring back.”
36. When he came to Solomon, he said, “Are 
you supplying me with money? What Allah 
has given me is better than what He has given 
you. It is you who delight in your gift.
37. Go back to them. We will come upon them 
with troops they cannot resist; and we will ex￾pel them from there, disgraced and humili￾ated.”
38. He said, “O notables, which one of you will 
bring me her throne before they come to me 
in submission?”
39. An imp of the sprites said, “I will bring it to 
you before you rise from your seat. I am 
strong and reliable enough to do it.”
40. He who had knowledge from the Book 
said, “I will bring it to you before your glance 
returns to you.” And when he saw it settled 
before him, he said, “This is from the grace of 
my Lord, to test me, whether I am grateful or 
ungrateful. He who is grateful, his gratitude 
is to his own credit; but he who is ungrate￾ful—my Lord is Independent and Generous.”
41. He said, “Disguise her throne for her, and 
we shall see whether she will be guided, or re￾mains one of the misguided.”
42. When she arrived, it was said, “Is your 
throne like this?” She said, “As if this is it.” 
“We were given knowledge before her, and 
we were submissive.”
43. But she was prevented by what she wor￾shiped besides Allah; she belonged to a disbe￾lieving people.
44. It was said to her, “Go inside the palace.” 
And when she saw it, she thought it was a 
deep pond, and she bared her legs. He said, 
“It is a palace paved with glass.” She said, “My 
Lord, I have done wrong to myself, and I have 
submitted with Solomon, to Allah, Lord of 
the Worlds.”
45. And We sent to Thamood their brother 
Saleh: “Worship Allah.” But they became two 
disputing factions.
46. He said, “O my people, why are you quick 
to do evil rather than good? If only you would 
seek Allah’s forgiveness, so that you may be 
shown mercy.”
47. They said, “We consider you an ill omen, 
and those with you.” He said, “Your omen is 
with Allah. In fact, you are a people being 
tested.”
48. In the city was a gang of nine who made 
mischief in the land and did no good.
49. They said, “Swear by Allah to one another 
that we will attack him and his family by 
night, and then tell his guardian, 'We did not 
witness the murder of his family, and we are 
being truthful.'“
50. They planned a plan, and We planned a 
plan, but they did not notice.
51. So note the outcome of their planning; We 
destroyed them and their people, altogether.
52. Here are their homes, in ruins, on account 
of their iniquities. Surely in this is a sign for 
people who know.
53. And We saved those who believed and 
were pious.
54. And Lot, when he said to his people, “Do 
you commit lewdness with open eyes?
55. Do you lust after men instead of women? 
You are truly ignorant people.”
56. But the only response of his people was to 
say, “Expel the family of Lot from your town. 
They are purist people.”
57. So We saved him and his family, except for 
his wife, whom We destined to be among the 
laggards.
58. And We rained upon them a rain. Misera￾ble was the rain of those forewarned.
59. Say, “Praise Allah, and peace be upon His 
servants whom He has selected. Is Allah bet￾ter, or what they associate?”
60. Or, who created the heavens and the earth, 
and rains down water from the sky for you? 
With it We produce gardens full of beauty, 
whose trees you could not have produced. Is 
143
27. THE ANT (an-Naml)
there another god with Allah? But they are a 
people who equate.
61. Or, who made the earth habitable, and 
made rivers flow through it, and set moun￾tains on it, and placed a partition between the 
two seas? Is there another god with Allah? 
But most of them do not know.
62. Or, who answers the one in need when he 
prays to Him, and relieves adversity, and 
makes you successors on earth? Is there an￾other god with Allah? How hardly you pay at￾tention.
63. Or, who guides you through the darkness 
of land and sea, and who sends the winds as 
heralds of His mercy? Is there another god 
with Allah? Most exalted is Allah, above what 
they associate.
64. Or, who originates the creation and then 
repeats it, and who gives you livelihood from 
the sky and the earth? Is there another god 
with Allah? Say, “Produce your evidence, if 
you are truthful.”
65. Say, “No one in the heavens or on earth 
knows the future except Allah; and they do 
not perceive when they will be resurrected.”
66. In fact, their knowledge of the Hereafter is 
confused. In fact, they are in doubt about it. 
In fact, they are blind to it.
67. Those who disbelieve say, “When we have 
become dust, and our ancestors, shall we be 
brought out?
68. We were promised that before, we and our 
ancestors—these are nothing but legends of 
the ancients.”
69. Say, travel through the earth, and observe 
the fate of the guilty.”
70. But do not grieve over them, and do not be 
troubled by what they plot.
71. And they say, “When is this promise, if you 
are truthful?”
72. Say, “Perhaps some of what you are impa￾tient for has drawn near.”
73. Your Lord is gracious towards humanity, 
but most of them are not thankful.
74. And your Lord knows what their hearts 
conceal, and what they reveal.
75. There is no mystery in the heaven and the 
earth, but it is in a Clear Book.
76. This Quran relates to the Children of Israel 
most of what they differ about.
77. And it is guidance and mercy for the be￾lievers.
78. Your Lord will judge between them by His 
wisdom. He is the Almighty, the All-Know￾ing.
79. So rely on Allah. You are upon the clear 
truth.
80. You cannot make the dead hear, nor can 
you make the deaf hear the call if they turn 
their backs and flee.
81. Nor can you guide the blind out of their 
straying. You can make no one listen, except 
those who believe in Our verses; for they are 
Muslims.
82. And when the Word has fallen on them, 
We will bring out for them from the earth a 
creature which will say to them that the peo￾ple are uncertain of Our revelations.
83. On the Day when We gather from every 
community a group of those who rejected 
Our revelations; and they will be restrained.
84. Until, when they arrive, He will say, “Did 
you reject My revelations without compre￾hending them? Or what is it you were doing?”
85. The Word will come down upon them for 
their wrongdoing, and they will not speak.
86. Do they not see that We made the night for 
them to rest therein, and the day for visibil￾ity? Surely in that are signs for people who 
believe.
87. On the Day when the Trumpet is blown, 
everyone in the heavens and the earth will be 
horrified, except whomever Allah wills; and 
everyone will come before Him in humility.
88. And you see the mountains, and imagine 
them fixed, yet they pass, as the passing of the 
144
28. HISTORY (al-Qasas)
clouds—the making of Allah, who has per￾fected everything. He is fully Informed of 
what you do.
89. Whoever brings a virtue will receive better 
than it—and they will be safe from the hor￾rors of that Day.
90. But whoever brings evil—their faces will be 
tumbled into the Fire. Will you be rewarded 
except for what you used to do?
91. “I was commanded to worship the Lord of 
this town, who has sanctified it, and to 
Whom everything belongs; and I was com￾manded to be of those who submit.
92. And to recite the Quran.” Whoever is 
guided—is guided to his own advantage. And 
whoever goes astray, then say, “I am one of 
the warners.”
93. And say, “Praise belongs to Allah; He will 
show you His signs, and you will recognize 
them. Your Lord is not heedless of what you 
do.”
28. HISTORY
(al-Qasas)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Ta, Seen, Meem.
2. These are the Verses of the Clear Book.
3. We narrate to you from the history of Mo￾ses and Pharaoh—in truth—for people who 
believe.
4. Pharaoh exalted himself in the land, and di￾vided its people into factions. He persecuted 
a group of them, slaughtering their sons, 
while sparing their daughters. He was truly a 
corrupter.
5. But We desired to favor those who were op￾pressed in the land, and to make them lead￾ers, and to make them the inheritors.
6. And to establish them in the land; and to 
show Pharaoh, Hamaan, and their troops, the 
very thing they feared.
7. We inspired the mother of Moses: “Nurse 
him; then, when you fear for him, cast him 
into the river, and do not fear, nor grieve; We 
will return him to you, and make him one of 
the messengers.”
8. Pharaoh’s household picked him up, to be 
an opponent and a sorrow for them. Pharaoh, 
Hamaan, and their troops were sinners.
9. Pharaoh’s wife said, “An eye's delight for me 
and for you. Do not kill him; perhaps he will 
be useful to us, or we may adopt him as a 
son.” But they did not foresee.
10. The heart of Moses’ mother became vacant. 
She was about to disclose him, had We not 
steadied her heart, that she may remain a be￾liever.
11. She said to his sister, “Trail him.” So she 
watched him from afar, and they were una￾ware.
12. We forbade him breastfeeding at first. So 
she said, “Shall I tell you about a family that 
can raise him for you, and will look after 
him?”
13. Thus We returned him to his mother, that 
she may be comforted, and not grieve, and 
know that Allah’s promise is true. But most 
of them do not know.
14. And when he reached his maturity, and be￾came established, We gave him wisdom and 
knowledge. Thus do We reward the virtuous.
15. Once he entered the city, unnoticed by its 
people. He found in it two men fighting—one 
of his own sect, and one from his enemies. 
The one of his sect solicited his assistance 
against the one from his enemies; so Moses 
punched him, and put an end to him. He said, 
“This is of Satan's doing; he is an enemy that 
openly misleads.”
16. He said, “My Lord, I have wronged myself, 
so forgive me.” So He forgave him. He is the 
Forgiver, the Merciful.
17. He said, “My Lord, in as much as you have 
favored me, I will never be a supporter of the 
criminals.”
145
28. HISTORY (al-Qasas)
18. The next morning, he went about in the 
city, fearful and vigilant, when the man who 
had sought his assistance the day before was 
shouting out to him. Moses said to him, “You 
are clearly a troublemaker.”
19. As he was about to strike the one who was 
their enemy, he said, “O Moses, do you in￾tend to kill me, as you killed someone yester￾day? You only want to be a bully in the land, 
and do not want to be a peacemaker.”
20. And a man came from the farthest part of 
the city running. He said, “O Moses, the au￾thorities are considering killing you, so leave; 
I am giving you good advice.”
21. So he left, fearful and vigilant. He said, “My 
Lord, deliver me from the wrongdoing peo￾ple.”
22. As he headed towards Median, he said, 
“Perhaps my Lord will guide me to the right 
way.”
23. And when he arrived at the waters of Me￾dian, he found there a crowd of people draw￾ing water, and he noticed two women waiting 
on the side. He said, “What is the matter with 
you?” They said, “We cannot draw water un￾til the shepherds depart, and our father is a 
very old man.”
24. So he drew water for them, and then with￾drew to the shade, and said, “My Lord, I am 
in dire need of whatever good you might send 
down to me.”
25. Then, one of the two women approached 
him, walking bashfully. She said, “My father 
is calling you, to reward you for drawing wa￾ter for us.” And when he came to him, and 
told him the story, he said, “Do not fear, you 
have escaped from the wrongdoing people.”
26. One of the two women said, “Father, hire 
him; the best employee for you is the strong 
and trustworthy.”
27. He said, “I want to marry you to one of 
these two daughters of mine, provided you 
work for me for eight years. But if you com￾plete ten, that is up to you. I do not intend to 
impose any hardship on you. You will find 
me, Allah willing, one of the righteous.”
28. He said, “Let this be an agreement between 
you and me. Whichever of the two terms I 
fulfill, there shall be no reprisal against me; 
and Allah is witness over what we say.”
29. When Moses had completed the term, and 
departed with his family, he noticed a fire by 
the side of the Mount. He said to his family, 
“Stay here, I have glimpsed a fire. Perhaps I 
can bring you some information from there, 
or an ember from the fire, that you may warm 
yourselves.”
30. When he reached it, he was called from the 
right side of the valley, at the Blessed Spot, 
from the bush: “O Moses, it is I, Allah, the 
Lord of the Worlds.
31. Throw down your staff.” And when he saw 
it wiggling, as if it were possessed, he turned 
his back to flee, and did not look back. “O 
Moses, come forward, and do not fear, you 
are perfectly safe.
32. Put your hand inside your pocket, and it 
will come out white, without blemish. And 
press your arm to your side, against fear. 
These are two proofs from your Lord, to 
Pharaoh and his dignitaries. They are truly 
sinful people.”
33. He said, “My Lord, I have killed one of 
them, and I fear they will kill me.
34. And my brother Aaron, he is more elo￾quent than me, so send him with me, to help 
me, and to confirm my words, for I fear they 
will reject me.”
35. He said, “We will strengthen your arm with 
your brother, and We will give you authority, 
so they will not touch you. By virtue of Our 
signs, you and those who follow you will be 
the triumphant.”
36. But when Moses came to them with Our 
signs, clear and manifest, they said, “This is 
nothing but fabricated magic, and We never 
heard of this from our ancestors of old.”
37. Moses said, “My Lord is well aware of him 
who brings guidance from Him, and him 
who will have the sequel of the abode. The 
wrongdoers will not succeed.”
146
28. HISTORY (al-Qasas)
38. Pharaoh said, “O nobles, I know of no god 
for you other than me. So fire-up the bricks 
for me O Hamaan, and build me a tower, that 
I may ascend to the God of Moses, though I 
think he is a liar.”
39. He and his troops acted arrogantly in the 
land, with no justification. They thought they 
would not be returned to Us.
40. So We seized him, and his troops, and We 
threw them into the sea. Observe, therefore, 
what was the end of the oppressors.
41. And We made them leaders calling to the 
Fire. And on Resurrection Day, they will not 
be saved.
42. And We pursued them in this world with a 
curse. And on Resurrection Day, they will be 
among the despised.
43. We gave Moses the Scripture after We had 
annihilated the previous generations; as an il￾lumination for mankind, and guidance, and 
mercy, so that they may remember.
44. You were not on the Western Side when 
We decreed the command to Moses, nor 
were you among the witnesses.
45. But We established many generations, and 
time took its toll on them. Nor were you 
among the people of Median, reciting Our 
revelations to them. But We kept sending 
messengers.
46. Nor were you by the side of the Mount 
when We proclaimed. Rather, it was a mercy 
from your Lord, that you may warn people 
who received no warner before you, so that 
they may take heed.
47. Otherwise, if a calamity befell them as a re￾sult of what their hands have perpetrated, 
they would say, “Our Lord, if only You had 
sent us a messenger, we would have followed 
Your revelations, and been among the believ￾ers.”
48. But when the truth came to them from Us, 
they said, “If only he was given the like of 
what was given to Moses.” Did they not dis￾believe in what was given to Moses in the 
past? They said, “Two works of magic back￾ing one another.” And they said, “We are dis￾believing in both.”
49. Say, “Then bring a scripture from Allah, 
more conductive to guidance than both, and 
I will follow it, if you are truthful.”
50. But if they fail to respond to you, know that 
they follow their fancies. And who is more 
lost than him who follows his fancy without 
guidance from Allah? Allah does not guide 
the unjust people.
51. We have delivered the Word to them, that 
they may remember.
52. Those to whom We gave the Scripture be￾fore it believe in it.
53. When it is recited to them, they say, “We 
have believed in it; it is the truth from our 
Lord; we were Muslims prior to it.”
54. These will be given their reward twice, be￾cause they persevered; and they counter evil 
with good; and from Our provisions to them, 
they give.
55. And when they hear vain talk, they avoid 
it, and say, “We have our deeds, and you have 
your deeds; peace be upon you; we do not de￾sire the ignorant.”
56. You cannot guide whom you love, but Al￾lah guides whom He wills, and He knows best 
those who are guided.
57. And they say, “If we follow the guidance 
with you, we will be snatched from our land.” 
Did We not establish for them a Safe Sanctu￾ary, to which are brought all kinds of fruits, 
as provision from Ourselves? But most of 
them do not know.
58. And how many a city did We destroy for 
turning unappreciative of its livelihood? Here 
are their homes, uninhabited after them, ex￾cept for a few. And We became the Inheri￾tors.
59. Your Lord never destroys cities without 
first sending a messenger in their midst, re￾citing to them Our revelations. And We 
never destroy the cities, unless their people 
are wrongdoers.
147
28. HISTORY (al-Qasas)
60. Whatever thing you are given is but the 
material of this world, and its glitter. But 
what is with Allah is better, and longer last￾ing. Do you not comprehend?
61. Can someone to whom We have made a 
fine promise—which he will attain—be equal 
to someone to whom We have given enjoy￾ments in this world, but who will be, on Res￾urrection Day, among the arraigned?
62. On the Day when He will call to them, and 
say, “Where are My associates whom you 
used to claim?”
63. Those against whom the sentence is justi￾fied will say, “Our Lord, these are they whom 
we misled. We misled them, as we were mis￾led. We beg Your forgiveness; it was not us 
they used to worship.”
64. And it will be said, “Call on your partners.” 
And they will call on them, but they will not 
respond to them. And they will see the suffer￾ing. If only they were guided.
65. On the Day when He will call to them, and 
say, “What did you answer the Messengers?”
66. They will be blinded by the facts on that 
Day, and they will not question each other.
67. But he who repents, and believes, and does 
righteous deeds, may well be among the win￾ners.
68. Your Lord creates whatever He wills, and 
He chooses. The choice is not theirs. Glory be 
to Allah, and exalted be He above the associ￾ations they make.
69. And your Lord knows what their hearts 
conceal, and what they reveal.
70. And He is Allah. There is no god but He. 
To Him belongs all praise in this life, and in 
the next. And His is the decision, and to Him 
you will be returned.
71. Say, “Have you considered? Had Allah 
made the night perpetual over you until the 
Day of Resurrection, which god other than 
Allah will bring you illumination? Do you 
not hear?”
72. Say, “Have you considered? Had Allah 
made the day perpetual over you until the 
Day of Resurrection, which god other than 
Allah will bring you night to rest in? Do you 
not see?”
73. It is out of His mercy that He made for you 
the night and the day, that you may rest in it, 
and seek some of His bounty; and that you 
may give thanks.
74. On the Day when He will call to them, and 
say, “Where are My associates whom you 
used to claim?”
75. And We will draw out from every commu￾nity a witness, and say, “Produce your evi￾dence.” Then they will realize that the truth is 
Allah’s, and those they used to invent have 
forsaken them.
76. Quaroon belonged to the clan of Moses, 
but he oppressed them. We had given him 
treasures, the keys of which would weigh 
down a group of strong men. His people said 
to him, “Do not exult; Allah does not love the 
exultant.
77. But seek, with what Allah has given you, 
the Home of the Hereafter, and do not ne￾glect your share of this world. And be chari￾table, as Allah has been charitable to you. 
And do not seek corruption in the land. Allah 
does not like the seekers of corruption.”
78. He said, “I was given all this on account of 
knowledge I possess.” Did he not know that 
Allah destroyed many generations before 
him, who were stronger than he, and pos￾sessed greater riches? But the guilty will not 
be asked about their sins.
79. And he went out before his people in his 
splendor. Those who desired the worldly life 
said, “If only we possessed the likes of what 
Quaroon was given. He is indeed very fortu￾nate.”
80. But those who were given knowledge said, 
“Woe to you! The reward of Allah is better for 
those who believe and do righteous deeds.” 
Yet none attains it except the steadfast.
81. So We caused the earth to cave in on him
and his mansion. He had no company to save 
him from Allah, and he could not defend 
himself.
148
29. THE SPIDER (al-’Ankabut)
82. Those who had wished they were in his po￾sition the day before were saying, “Indeed, it 
is Allah who spreads the bounty to whomever 
He wills of His servants, and restricts it. Had 
Allah not been gracious to us, He would have 
caved in on us. No wonder the ungrateful 
never prosper.”
83. That Home of the Hereafter—We assign it 
for those who seek no superiority on earth, 
nor corruption. And the outcome is for the 
cautious.
84. Whoever brings a virtue will receive better 
than it. But whoever brings evil—the evildo￾ers will be rewarded only according to what 
they used to do.
85. He Who ordained the Quran for you will 
return you Home. Say, “My Lord knows best 
who comes with guidance, and who is in 
manifest error.”
86. You did not expect the Scripture to be 
transmitted to you, except as mercy from 
your Lord. Therefore, do not be a supporter 
of the disbelievers.
87. And do not let them divert you from Al￾lah’s revelations after they have been revealed 
to you. And pray to your Lord, and never be 
of the polytheists.
88. And do not invoke with Allah any other 
god. There is no god but He. All things per￾ish, except His presence. His is the judgment, 
and to Him you will be returned.
29. THE SPIDER
(al-’Ankabut)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Alif, Lam, Meem.
2. Have the people supposed that they will be 
left alone to say, “We believe,” without being 
put to the test?
3. We have tested those before them. Allah 
will surely know the truthful, and He will 
surely know the liars.
4. Or do those who commit sins think they can 
fool Us? Terrible is their opinion!
5. Whoever looks forward to the meeting with 
Allah—the appointed time of Allah is com￾ing. He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.
6. Whoever strives, strives only for himself. 
Allah is Independent of the beings.
7. Those who believe and do righteous 
deeds—We will remit their sins, and We will 
reward them according to the best of what 
they used to do.
8. We have advised the human being to be 
good to his parents. But if they urge you to 
associate with Me something you have no 
knowledge of, do not obey them. To Me is 
your return; and I will inform you of what 
you used to do.
9. Those who believe and do good works—We
will admit them into the company of the 
righteous.
10. Among the people is he who says, “We 
have believed in Allah.” Yet when he is 
harmed on Allah’s account, he equates the 
people's persecution with Allah’s retribution. 
And if help comes from your Lord, he says, 
“We were actually with you.” Is not Allah 
aware of what is inside the hearts of the peo￾ple?
11. Allah certainly knows those who believe, 
and He certainly knows the hypocrites.
12. Those who disbelieve say to those who be￾lieve, “Follow our way, and we will carry your 
sins.” In no way can they carry any of their 
sins. They are liars.
13. They will carry their own loads, and other 
loads with their own. And they will be ques￾tioned on the Day of Resurrection concern￾ing what they used to fabricate.
14. We sent Noah to his people, and He stayed 
among them for a thousand years minus fifty 
years. Then the Deluge swept them; for they 
were wrongdoers.
15. But We saved him, together with the com￾pany of the Ark, and We made it a sign for all 
peoples.
149
29. THE SPIDER (al-’Ankabut)
16. And Abraham, when he said to his people, 
“Worship Allah, and fear Him. That is better 
for you, if you only knew.
17. You worship idols besides Allah, and you 
fabricate falsehoods. Those you worship, in￾stead of Allah, cannot provide you with live￾lihood. So seek your livelihood from Allah, 
and worship Him, and thank Him. To Him 
you will be returned.”
18. If you disbelieve, communities before you 
have also disbelieved. The Messenger is only 
responsible for clear transmission.
19. Have they not seen how Allah originates 
the creation, and then reproduces it? This is 
easy for Allah.
20. Say, “Roam the earth, and observe how He 
originated the creation.” Then Allah will 
bring about the next existence. Allah has 
power over all things.” 
21. He punishes whom He wills, and He grants 
mercy to whom He wills, and to Him you will 
be restored.
22. You cannot escape, on earth or in the 
heaven; and you have no protector and no 
savior besides Allah.
23. Those who disbelieved in Allah’s signs and 
His encounter—these have despaired of My 
mercy. For them is a painful torment.
24. But the only response from his people was 
their saying, “Kill him, or burn him.” But Al￾lah saved him from the fire. Surely in that are 
signs for people who believe.
25. And he said, “You have chosen idols in￾stead of Allah, out of affection for one an￾other in the worldly life. But then, on the Day 
of Resurrection, you will disown one another, 
and curse one another. Your destiny is Hell, 
and you will have no saviors.”
26. Then Lot believed in him, and said, “I am 
emigrating to my Lord. He is the Noble, the 
Wise.”
27. And We granted him Isaac and Jacob, and 
conferred on his descendants the 
Prophethood and the Book, and gave him his 
reward in this life; and in the Hereafter he will 
be among the upright.
28. And Lot, when he said to his people, “You 
are committing an obscenity not perpetrated 
before you by anyone in the whole world.
29. You approach men, and cut off the way, 
and commit lewdness in your gatherings.” 
But the only response from his people was to 
say, “Bring upon us Allah’s punishment, if 
you are truthful.”
30. He said, “My Lord, help me against the 
people of corruption.”
31. And when Our envoys brought Abraham 
the good news, they said, “We are going to 
destroy the people of this town; its people are 
wrongdoers.”
32. He said, “Yet Lot is in it.” They said, “We 
are well aware of who is in it. We will save 
him, and his family, except for his wife, who 
will remain behind.”
33. Then, when Our envoys came to Lot, they 
were mistreated, and he was troubled and 
distressed on their account. They said, “Do 
not fear, nor grieve. We will save you and 
your family, except for your wife, who will re￾main behind.”
34. “We will bring down upon the people of 
this town a scourge from heaven, because of 
their wickedness.”
35. And We left behind a clear trace of it, for 
people who understand.
36. And to Median, their brother Shuaib. He 
said, “O my people, worship Allah and antic￾ipate the Last Day, and do not spread corrup￾tion in the land.”
37. But they rejected him, so the tremor over￾took them, and they were left motionless in 
their homes.
38. And Aad and Thamood. It has become 
clear to you from their dwellings. Satan em￾bellished for them their deeds, barring them 
from the path, even though they could see.
150
29. THE SPIDER (al-’Ankabut)
39. And Quaroon, and Pharaoh, and Ha￾maan—Moses went to them with clear argu￾ments, but they acted arrogantly in the land. 
And they could not get ahead.
40. Each We seized by his sin. Against some 
We sent a sandstorm. Some were struck by 
the Blast. Some We caused the ground to cave 
in beneath them. And some We drowned. It 
was not Allah who wronged them, but it was 
they who wronged their own selves.
41. The likeness of those who take to them￾selves protectors other than Allah is that of 
the spider. It builds a house. But the most 
fragile of houses is the spider’s house. If they 
only knew.
42. Allah knows what they invoke besides 
Him. He is the Almighty, the Wise.
43. These examples—We put them forward to 
the people; but none grasps them except the 
learned.
44. Allah created the heavens and the earth 
with truth. Surely in that is a sign for the be￾lievers.
45. Recite what is revealed to you of the Scrip￾ture, and perform the prayer. The prayer pre￾vents indecencies and evils. And the remem￾brance of Allah is greater. And Allah knows 
what you do.
46. And do not argue with the People of the 
Scripture except in the best manner possible, 
except those who do wrong among them. 
And say, “We believe in what was revealed to 
us, and in what was revealed to you; and our 
God and your God is One; and to Him we are 
submissive.”
47. Likewise, We revealed to you the Scripture. 
Those to whom We gave the Scripture believe 
in it, and some of these believe in it. None re￾nounce Our communications except the dis￾believers.
48. You did not read any scripture before this, 
nor did you write it down with your right 
hand; otherwise the falsifiers would have 
doubted.
49. In fact, it is clear signs in the hearts of those 
given knowledge. No one renounce Our signs 
except the unjust.
50. And they said, “If only a miracle from his 
Lord was sent down to him.” Say, “Miracles 
are only with Allah, and I am only a clear 
warner.”
51. Does it not suffice them that We revealed 
to you the Scripture, which is recited to them? 
In that is mercy and a reminder for people 
who believe. 
52. Say, “Allah suffices as witness between you 
and me. He knows everything in the heavens 
and the Earth. Those who believe in vanity 
and reject Allah—it is they who are the los￾ers.”
53. And they urge you to hasten the punish￾ment. Were it not for a specified time, the 
punishment would have come to them. But it 
will come upon them suddenly, while they 
are unaware.
54. They urge you to hasten the punishment. 
But Hell will engulf the disbelievers.
55. On the Day when the punishment will en￾velop them, from above them, and from be￾neath their feet, He will say, “Taste what you 
used to do!”
56. O My servants who have believed: My 
earth is vast, so worship Me alone.
57. Every soul will taste death. Then to Us you 
will be returned.
58. Those who believe and work righteous￾ness—We will settle them in Paradise, in 
mansions under which rivers flow, dwelling 
therein forever. Excellent is the compensa￾tion for the workers.
59. Those who endure patiently, and in their 
Lord they trust.
60. How many a creature there is that does not 
carry its provision? Allah provides for them, 
and for you. He is the Hearer, the Knowl￾edgeable.
61. And if you asked them, “Who created the 
heavens and the earth and regulated the sun 
151
30. THE ROMANS (ar-Rum)
and the moon?” They would say, “Allah.” 
Why then do they deviate?
62. Allah expands the provision for whomever 
He wills of His servants, and restricts it. Allah 
is Cognizant of all things.
63. And if you asked them, “Who sends water 
down from the sky, with which He revives the 
earth after it had died?” They would say, “Al￾lah.” Say, “Praise be to Allah.” But most of 
them do not understand.
64. The life of this world is nothing but diver￾sion and play, and the Home of the Hereafter 
is the Life, if they only knew.
65. When they embark on a vessel, they pray 
to Allah, devoting their faith to Him; but 
once He has delivered them safely to land, 
they attribute partners to Him.
66. To be ungrateful for what We have given 
them, and to enjoy themselves. They will 
surely come to know.
67. Do they not see that We established a Se￾cure Sanctuary, while all around them the 
people are being carried away? Do they be￾lieve in falsehood, and reject the blessings of 
Allah?
68. And who does greater wrong than he who 
fabricates lies and attributes them to Allah, or 
calls the truth a lie when it has come to him? 
Is there not in Hell a dwelling for the blas￾phemers?
69. As for those who strive for Us—We will 
guide them in Our ways. Allah is with the do￾ers of good.
30. THE ROMANS
(ar-Rum)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Alif, Lam, Meem.
2. The Romans have been defeated.
3. In a nearby territory. But following their de￾feat, they will be victorious.
4. In a few years. The matter is up to Allah, in 
the past, and in the future. On that day, the 
believers will rejoice.
5. In Allah’s support. He supports whomever 
He wills. He is the Almighty, the Merciful.
6. The promise of Allah—Allah never breaks 
His promise, but most people do not know.
7. They know an outer aspect of the worldly 
life, but they are heedless of the Hereafter.
8. Do they not reflect within themselves? Al￾lah did not create the heavens and the earth, 
and what is between them, except with rea￾son, and for a specific duration. But most 
people, regarding meeting their Lord, are dis￾believers.
9. Have they not travelled the earth and seen 
how those before them ended up? They were 
more powerful than them, and they culti￾vated the land and developed it more than 
they developed it, and their messengers came 
to them with clear signs. Allah would never 
wrong them, but they used to wrong them￾selves.
10. Then, evil was the end of those who com￾mitted evil. That is because they rejected Al￾lah’s revelations, and used to ridicule them.
11. Allah originates creation, and then repeats 
it. Then to Him you will be returned.
12. On the Day when the Hour takes place, the 
guilty will despair.
13. They will have no intercessors from among 
their idols, and they will disown their part￾ners.
14. On the Day when the Hour takes place—
on that Day they will separate.
15. As for those who believed and did good 
deeds—they will be delighted in meadows.
16. But as for those who disbelieved, and re￾jected Our signs and the encounter of the 
Hereafter—those will be hauled into the tor￾ment.
17. So glorify Allah when you retire at night, 
and when you rise in the morning.
152
30. THE ROMANS (ar-Rum)
18. His is the praise in the heavens and on 
earth, and in the evening, and when you 
reach midday.
19. He brings the living out of the dead, and He 
brings the dead out of the living, and He re￾vives the land after it had died. Likewise you 
will be resurrected.
20. And of His signs is that He created you 
from dust; and behold, you become humans 
spreading out.
21. And of His signs is that He created for you 
mates from among yourselves, so that you 
may find tranquility in them; and He planted 
love and compassion between you. In this are 
signs for people who reflect.
22. And of His signs is the creation of the heav￾ens and the earth, and the diversity of your 
languages and colors. In this are signs for 
those who know.
23. And of His signs are your sleep by night 
and day, and your pursuit of His bounty. In 
this are signs for people who listen.
24. And of His signs is that He shows you the 
lightning, causing fear and hope. And He 
brings down water from the sky, and with it 
He revives the earth after it was dead. In this 
are signs for people who understand.
25. And of His signs is that the heaven and the 
earth stand at His disposal. And then, when 
He calls you out of the earth, you will emerge 
at once.
26. To Him belongs everyone in the heavens 
and the earth. All are submissive to Him.
27. It is He who initiates creation, and then re￾peats it, something easy for Him. His is the 
highest attribute, in the heavens and the 
earth. He is the Almighty, the Wise.
28. He illustrates an example for you, from 
your own selves: do you make your servants 
full partners in the wealth We have given 
you? Do you revere them as you revere one 
another? We thus explain the revelations for 
a people who understand.
29. Yet the wrongdoers follow their desires 
without knowledge. But who can guide 
whom Allah leaves astray? They will have no 
helpers.
30. So devote yourself to the religion of mono￾theism—the natural instinct Allah has in￾stilled in mankind. There is no altering Al￾lah’s creation. This is the true religion, but 
most people do not know.
31. Turning towards Him—and be conscious 
of Him, and perform the prayer, and do not 
be of the idolaters.
32. Of those who divided their religion, and 
became sects; each faction pleased with what 
they have.
33. When affliction touches the people, they 
call on their Lord, turning to Him in repent￾ance. But then, when He gives them a taste of 
His mercy, some of them attribute partners to 
their Lord.
34. To show ingratitude for what We have 
given them. Indulge yourselves—you will 
surely know.
35. Have We sent down to them any authority, 
which speaks in support of their idols?
36. When We give people a taste of mercy, they 
rejoice in it. But when adversity befalls them, 
because of what their hands have perpetrated, 
they begin to despair.
37. Do they not see that Allah expands the pro￾vision for whomever He wills, or restricts it? 
Surely in this are signs for people who be￾lieve.
38. So give the relative his rights, and the des￾titute, and the wayfarer. That is best for those 
who seek Allah’s presence. Those are the 
prosperous.
39. The usury you practice, seeking thereby to 
multiply people’s wealth, will not multiply 
with Allah. But what you give in charity, de￾siring Allah’s approval—these are the multi￾pliers.
40. Allah is He who created you, then provides 
for you, then makes you die, then brings you 
back to life. Can any of your idols do any of 
that? Glorified is He, and Exalted above what 
they associate.
153
31. LUQMAN (Luqman)
41. Corruption has appeared on land and sea, 
because of what people’s hands have earned, 
in order to make them taste some of what 
they have done, so that they might return.
42. Say, “Roam the earth, and observe the fate 
of those who came before. Most of them were 
idolaters.”
43. So devote yourself to the upright religion, 
before there comes from Allah a Day that 
cannot be averted. On that Day, they will be 
shocked.
44. Whoever disbelieves, upon him falls his 
disbelief. And whoever acts righteously—
they are preparing for themselves.
45. So that He may reward those who have be￾lieved and done the righteous deeds out of 
His bounty. Indeed, He does not love the un￾grateful.
46. And of His signs is that He sends the winds 
bearing good news, to give you a taste of His 
mercy, and so that the ships may sail by His 
command, and so that you may seek of His 
bounty, and so that you may give thanks.
47. Before you, We sent messengers to their 
people. They came to them with clear proofs. 
Then We took revenge on those who sinned. 
It is incumbent on Us to help the believers.
48. Allah is He who sends the winds. They stir 
up clouds. Then He spreads them in the sky 
as He wills. And He breaks them apart. Then 
you see rain drops issuing from their midst. 
Then, when He makes it fall upon whom He 
wills of His servants, behold, they rejoice.
49. Although they were before this—before it 
was sent down upon them—in despair.
50. So observe the effects of Allah’s mercy—
how He revives the earth after it was dead. In￾deed, He is the Reviver of the dead. He is Ca￾pable of everything.
51. But if We send a wind, and they see it turn￾ing things yellow, they would continue there￾after to disbelieve.
52. You cannot make the dead hear, nor can 
you make the deaf hear the call when they 
turn away.
53. Nor can you guide the blind out of their er￾ror. You can make hear only those who be￾lieve in Our signs, and so have submitted.
54. Allah is He Who created you weak, then af￾ter weakness gave you strength, then after 
strength gave you weakness and gray hair. He 
creates whatever He wills. He is the Omnisci￾ent, the Omnipotent.
55. On the Day when the Hour takes place, the 
sinners will swear they had stayed but an 
hour. Thus they were deluded.
56. But those endowed with knowledge and 
faith will say, “You remained in Allah’s Book 
until the Day of Resurrection. This is the Day 
of Resurrection, but you did not know.”
57. On that Day, the sinners’ excuses will not 
benefit them, nor will they be excused.
58. We have cited in this Quran for the people 
every sort of parable. But even if you bring 
them a miracle, those who disbelieve will say, 
“You are nothing but fakers.”
59. Allah thus seals the hearts of those who do 
not know.
60. So be patient. The promise of Allah is true. 
And do not let those who lack certainty belit￾tle you.
31. LUQMAN
(Luqman)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Alif, Lam, Meem.
2. These are the Verses of the Wise Book.
3. A guide and a mercy for the righteous.
4. Those who observe the prayer, and pay the 
obligatory charity, and are certain of the 
Hereafter. 
5. These are upon guidance from their Lord. 
These are the successful.
6. Among the people is he who trades in dis￾tracting tales; intending, without knowledge, 
to lead away from Allah’s way, and to make a 
154
31. LUQMAN (Luqman)
mockery of it. These will have a humiliating 
punishment.
7. And when Our Verses are recited to him, he 
turns away in pride, as though he did not hear 
them, as though there is deafness in his ears. 
So inform him of a painful punishment.
8. As for those who believe and do good 
deeds—for them are the Gardens of Bliss.
9. Dwelling therein forever. The promise of 
Allah is true. He is the Mighty, the Wise.
10. He created the heavens without pillars that 
you can see, and placed stabilizers on earth 
lest it shifts with you, and scattered through￾out it all kinds of creatures. And from the sky 
We sent down water, and caused to grow 
therein of every noble pair.
11. Such is Allah’s creation. Now show me 
what those besides Him have created. In fact, 
the wicked are in obvious error.
12. We endowed Luqman with wisdom: “Give 
thanks to Allah.” Whoever is appreciative—
is appreciative for the benefit of his own soul. 
And whoever is unappreciative—Allah is 
Sufficient and Praiseworthy.
13. When Luqman said to his son, as he ad￾vised him, “O my son, do not associate any￾thing with Allah, for idolatry is a terrible 
wrong.”
14. We have entrusted the human being with 
the care of his parents. His mother carried 
him through hardship upon hardship, wean￾ing him in two years. So give thanks to Me, 
and to your parents. To Me is the destination.
15. But if they strive to have you associate with 
Me something of which you have no
knowledge, do not obey them. But keep them 
company in this life, in kindness, and follow 
the path of him who turns to Me. Then to Me 
is your return; and I will inform you of what 
you used to do.
16. “O my son, even if it were the weight of a 
mustard-seed, in a rock, or in the heavens, or 
on earth, Allah will bring it to light. Allah is 
Kind and Expert.
17. O my son, observe the prayer, advocate 
righteousness, forbid evil, and be patient over 
what has befallen you. These are of the most 
honorable traits.
18. And do not treat people with arrogance, 
nor walk proudly on earth. Allah does not 
love the arrogant showoffs.
19. And moderate your stride, and lower your 
voice. The most repulsive of voices is the 
donkey’s voice.”
20. Do you not see how Allah placed at your 
service everything in the heavens and the 
earth? How He showered you with His bless￾ings, both outward and inward? Yet among 
the people is he who argues about Allah with￾out knowledge, without guidance, and with￾out an enlightening Scripture.
21. And when it is said to them, “Follow what 
Allah has revealed,” they say, “Rather, we fol￾low what we found our parents devoted to.” 
Even if Satan is calling them to the suffering 
of the Blaze? 
22. Whoever submits himself wholly to Allah, 
and is a doer of good, has grasped the most 
trustworthy handle. With Allah rests the out￾come of all events.
23. Whoever disbelieves—let not his disbelief 
sadden you. To Us is their return. Then We 
will inform them of what they did. Allah 
knows what lies within the hearts.
24. We give them a little comfort; then We 
compel them to a harsh torment.
25. And if you ask them, “Who created the 
heavens and the earth?” They will say, “Al￾lah.” Say, “Praise be to Allah.” But most of 
them do not know.
26. To Allah belongs everything in the heavens 
and the earth. Allah is the Rich, the Praised.
27. If all the trees on earth were pens, filled by 
the ocean, with seven more oceans besides, 
the Words of Allah would not run out. Allah 
is Majestic and Wise.
28. Your creation and your resurrection are 
only as a single soul. Allah is Hearing and 
Seeing.
155
32. PROSTRATION (as-Sajdah)
29. Have you not seen how Allah merges the 
night into the day, and merges the day into 
the night? That He subjected the sun and the 
moon, each running for a stated term? And 
that Allah is Cognizant of everything you do?
30. That is because Allah is the Reality, and 
what they worship besides Him is falsehood, 
and because Allah is the Exalted, the Su￾preme.
31. Have you not seen how the ships sail 
through the sea, by the grace of Allah, to 
show you of His wonders? In that are signs 
for every persevering, thankful person.
32. When waves, like canopies, cover them, 
they call upon Allah, devoting their religion 
to Him. But when He has delivered them to 
dry land, some of them waver. No one re￾nounces Our revelations except the treacher￾ous blasphemer.
33. O people! Be conscious of your Lord, and 
dread a Day when no parent can avail his 
child, nor can a child avail his parent, in any￾thing. The promise of Allah is true. There￾fore, do not let this life deceive you, nor let 
illusions deceive you regarding Allah.
34. With Allah rests the knowledge of the 
Hour. He sends down the rain, and He knows 
what the wombs contain. No soul knows 
what it will reap tomorrow, and no soul 
knows in what land it will die. Allah is All￾Knowing, Well-Informed.
32. PROSTRATION
(as-Sajdah)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Alif, Lam, Meem.
2. The revelation of the Book, without a doubt, 
is from the Lord of the Universe.
3. Yet they say, “He made it up.” In fact, it is 
the Truth from your Lord, to warn a people 
who received no warner before you, that they 
may be guided.
4. Allah is He who created the heavens and the 
earth and everything between them in six 
days, and then established Himself on the 
Throne. Apart from Him, you have no mas￾ter and no intercessor. Will you not reflect?
5. He regulates all affairs, from the heavens, to 
the earth. Then it ascends to Him on a Day 
the length of which is a thousand years by 
your count.
6. That is the Knower of the Invisible and the 
Visible, the Powerful, the Merciful.
7. He who perfected everything He created, 
and originated the creation of man from clay.
8. Then made his reproduction from an ex￾tract of an insignificant fluid.
9. Then He proportioned him, and breathed 
into him of His Spirit. Then He gave you the 
hearing, and the eyesight, and the brains—
but rarely do you give thanks.
10. And they say, “When we are lost into the 
earth, shall we be in a new creation?” In fact, 
they deny the meeting with their Lord.
11. Say, “The angel of death put in charge of 
you will reclaim you. Then to your Lord you 
will be returned.”
12. If only you could see the guilty, bowing 
their heads before their Lord: “Our Lord, we 
have seen and we have heard, so send us back, 
and we will act righteously; we are now con￾vinced.”
13. Had We willed, We could have given every 
soul its guidance, but the declaration from 
Me will come true: “I will fill Hell with jinn 
and humans, altogether.”
14. So taste, because you forgot the meeting of 
this Day of yours; We have forgotten you; so 
taste the eternal torment for what you used to 
do.
15. They believe in Our communications, 
those who, when reminded of them, fall 
down prostrate, and glorify their Lord with 
praise, and are not proud.
16. Their sides shun their beds, as they pray to 
their Lord, out of reverence and hope; and 
from Our provisions to them, they give.
156
33. THE CONFEDERATES (al-Ahzab)
17. No soul knows what eye’s delight awaits 
them—a reward for what they used to do.
18. Is someone who is faithful like someone 
who is a sinner? They are not equal.
19. As for those who believe and do righteous 
deeds, for them are the Gardens of Shelter—
hospitality for what they used to do.
20. But as for those who transgressed, their 
shelter is the Fire. Every time they try to get 
out of it, they will be brought back into it, and 
it will be said to them, “Taste the suffering of 
the Fire which you used to deny.”
21. We will make them taste the lesser tor￾ment, prior to the greater torment, so that 
they may return.
22. Who is more wrong than he, who, when 
reminded of his Lord’s revelations, turns 
away from them? We will certainly wreak 
vengeance upon the criminals.
23. We gave Moses the Book; so do not be in 
doubt regarding His encounter; and We 
made it a guidance for the Children of Israel.
24. And We appointed leaders from among 
them, guiding by Our command, as long as 
they persevered and were certain of Our 
communications.
25. Your Lord will judge between them on the 
Day of Resurrection regarding everything 
they had disputed.
26. Is it not a lesson for them, how many gen￾erations We have destroyed before them, in 
whose habitations they walk? Surely in that 
are signs. Do they not hear?
27. Do they not see how We conduct the water 
to a dry land, and with it We produce vegeta￾tion, from which their livestock eat, and 
themselves? Do they not see?
28. And they say, “When is this victory, if you 
are truthful?”
29. Say, “On the day of victory, the faith of 
those who disbelieved will be of no avail to 
them, and they will not be granted respite.”
30. So turn away from them, and wait. They 
too are waiting.
33. THE CONFEDERATES
(al-Ahzab)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. O Prophet! Fear Allah, and do not obey the 
unbelievers and the hypocrites. Allah is 
Knowledgeable and Wise.
2. And follow what is revealed to you from 
your Lord. Allah is fully aware of what you 
do.
3. And put your trust in Allah. Allah is enough 
as a trustee.
4. Allah did not place two hearts inside any 
man's body. Nor did He make your wives 
whom you equate with your mothers, your 
actual mothers. Nor did He make your 
adopted sons, your actual sons. These are 
your words coming out of your mouths. Al￾lah speaks the truth, and guides to the path.
5. Call them after their fathers; that is more 
equitable with Allah. But if you do not know 
their fathers, then your brethren in faith and 
your friends. There is no blame on you if you 
err therein, barring what your hearts pre￾meditates. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
6. The Prophet is more caring of the believers 
than they are of themselves, and his wives are 
mothers to them. And blood-relatives are 
closer to one another in Allah’s Book than the 
believers or the emigrants, though you 
should do good to your friends. That is in￾scribed in the Book.
7. Recall that We received a pledge from the 
prophets, and from you, and from Noah, and 
Abraham, and Moses, and Jesus son of Mary. 
We received from them a solemn pledge.
8. That He may ask the sincere about their sin￾cerity. He has prepared for the disbelievers a 
painful punishment.
9. O you who believe! Remember Allah’s 
blessings upon you, when forces came against 
you, and We sent against them a wind, and 
157
33. THE CONFEDERATES (al-Ahzab)
forces you did not see. Allah is Observant of 
what you do.
10. When they came upon you, from above 
you, and from beneath you; and the eyes be￾came dazed, and the hearts reached the 
throats, and you harbored doubts about Al￾lah.
11. There and then the believers were tested, 
and were shaken most severely.
12. When the hypocrites and those in whose 
hearts is sickness said, “Allah and His Mes￾senger promised us nothing but illusion.”
13. And when a group of them said, “O people 
of Yathrib, you cannot make a stand, so re￾treat.” And a faction of them asked the 
Prophet to excuse them, saying, “Our homes 
are exposed,” although they were not ex￾posed. They only wanted to flee.
14. Had it been invaded from its sides, and 
they were asked to dissent, they would have 
done so with little hesitation.
15. Although they had made a pledged to Al￾lah, in the past, that they will not turn their 
backs. A pledge to Allah is a responsibility.
16. Say, “Flight will not benefit you, if you flee 
from death or killing, even then you will be 
given only brief enjoyment.”
17. Say, “Who is it who will shield you from 
Allah, if He intends adversity for you, or in￾tends mercy for you?” Besides Allah, they will 
find for themselves neither friend nor helper.
18. Allah already knows the hinderers among 
you, and those who say to their brethren, 
“Come and join us.” Rarely do they mobilize 
for battle.
19. Being stingy towards you. And when fear 
approaches, you see them staring at you—
their eyes rolling—like someone fainting at 
death. Then, when panic is over, they whip 
you with sharp tongues. They resent you any 
good. These have never believed, so Allah has 
nullified their works; a matter easy for Allah.
20. They assumed that the confederates had 
not withdrawn. But were the confederates to 
advance, they would wish they were in the de￾sert with the Bedouins, inquiring about your 
news. And if they were among you, they 
would have done little fighting.
21. You have an excellent example in the Mes￾senger of Allah; for anyone who seeks Allah 
and the Last Day, and remembers Allah fre￾quently.
22. And when the believers saw the confeder￾ates, they said, “This is what Allah and His 
messenger have promised us; and Allah and 
His messenger have told the truth.” And it 
only increased them in faith and submission.
23. Of the believers are men who are true to 
what they pledged to Allah. Some of them 
have fulfilled their vows; and some are still 
waiting, and never wavering.
24. That Allah may reward the truthful for 
their truthfulness; and punish the hypocrites, 
if He wills, or pardon them. Allah is Forgiv￾ing and Merciful.
25. Allah repelled the disbelievers in their rage; 
they gained no advantage. Allah thus spared 
the believers combat. Allah is Strong and 
Mighty.
26. And He brought down from their strong￾holds those of the People of the Book who 
backed them, and He threw terror into their 
hearts. Some of them you killed, and others 
you took captive.
27. And He made you inherit their land, and 
their homes, and their possessions, and a re￾gion you have never stepped on. Allah has 
power over all things.
28. O Prophet! Say to your wives, “If you desire 
the life of this world and its finery, then let me 
compensate you, and release you kindly.
29. But if you desire Allah, His Messenger, and 
the Home of the Hereafter, then Allah has 
prepared for the righteous among you a mag￾nificent compensation.”
30. O wives of the Prophet! Whoever of you 
commits a proven indecency, the punish￾ment for her will be doubled. And that would 
be easy for Allah.
158
33. THE CONFEDERATES (al-Ahzab)
31. But whoever of you remains obedient to 
Allah and His Messenger, and acts right￾eously, We will give her a double reward; and 
We have prepared for her a generous provi￾sion.
32. O wives of the Prophet! You are not like 
any other women, if you observe piety. So do 
not speak too softly, lest the sick at heart lusts 
after you, but speak in an appropriate man￾ner.
33. And settle in your homes; and do not dis￾play yourselves, as in the former days of igno￾rance. And perform the prayer, and give reg￾ular charity, and obey Allah and His Messen￾ger. Allah desires to remove all impurity from 
you, O People of the Household, and to pu￾rify you thoroughly.
34. And remember what is recited in your 
homes of Allah's revelations and wisdom. Al￾lah is Kind and Informed.
35. Muslim men and Muslim women, believ￾ing men and believing women, obedient men 
and obedient women, truthful men and 
truthful women, patient men and patient 
women, humble men and humble women, 
charitable men and charitable women, fast￾ing men and fasting women, men who guard 
their chastity and women who guard, men 
who remember Allah frequently and women 
who remember—Allah has prepared for 
them a pardon, and an immense reward.
36. It is not for any believer, man or woman, 
when Allah and His Messenger have decided 
a matter, to have liberty of choice in their de￾cision. Whoever disobeys Allah and His Mes￾senger has gone far astray.
37. When you said to him whom Allah had 
blessed, and you had favored, “Keep your 
wife to yourself, and fear Allah.” But you hid 
within yourself what Allah was to reveal. And 
you feared the people, but it was Allah you 
were supposed to fear. Then, when Zaid 
ended his relationship with her, We gave her 
to you in marriage, that there may be no re￾striction for believers regarding the wives of 
their adopted sons, when their relationship 
has ended. The command of Allah was ful￾filled.
38. There is no blame on the Prophet regard￾ing what Allah has ordained for him. Such is 
the pattern of Allah among those who passed 
before. The command of Allah is an absolute 
decree.
39. Those who deliver the messages of Allah, 
and fear Him, and never fear anyone except 
Allah. Allah is sufficient as a reckoner.
40. Muhammad is not the father of any of your 
men; but he is the Messenger of Allah, and 
the seal of the prophets. Allah is Cognizant of 
everything.
41. O you who believe, remember Allah with 
frequent remembrance.
42. And glorify Him morning and evening.
43. It is He who reaches out to you, and His 
angels, to bring you out of darkness into the 
light. And He is Ever-Merciful towards the 
believers.
44. Their greeting on the Day they meet Him 
is, “Peace,” and He has prepared for them a 
generous reward.
45. O prophet! We have sent you as a witness, 
and a bearer of good news, and a warner.
46. And a caller towards Allah by His leave, 
and an illuminating beacon.
47. And give the believers the good news that 
for them is a great reward. 
48. And do not obey the blasphemers and the 
hypocrites, and ignore their insults, and rely 
on Allah. Allah is a sufficient protector.
49. O you who believe! When you marry be￾lieving women, but then divorce them before 
you have touched them, there is no waiting 
period for you to observe in respect to them; 
but compensate them, and release them in a
graceful manner.
50. O Prophet! We have permitted to you your 
wives to whom you have given their dowries, 
and those you already have, as granted to you 
by Allah, and the daughters of your paternal 
uncle, and the daughters of your paternal 
159
33. THE CONFEDERATES (al-Ahzab)
aunts, and the daughters of your maternal 
uncle, and the daughters of your maternal 
aunts who emigrated with you, and a believ￾ing woman who has offered herself to the 
Prophet, if the Prophet desires to marry her, 
exclusively for you, and not for the believers. 
We know what We have ordained for them 
regarding their wives and those their right￾hands possess. This is to spare you any diffi￾culty. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
51. You may defer any of them you wish, and 
receive any of them you wish. Should you de￾sire any of those you had deferred, there is no 
blame on you. This is more proper, so that 
they will be comforted, and not be grieved, 
and be content with what you have given 
each one of them. Allah knows what is within 
your hearts. Allah is Omniscient and Clem￾ent.
52. Beyond that, no other women are permis￾sible for you, nor can you exchange them for 
other wives, even if you admire their beauty, 
except those you already have. Allah is 
Watchful over all things.
53. O you who believe! Do not enter the homes 
of the Prophet, unless you are given permis￾sion to come for a meal; and do not wait for 
its preparation. And when you are invited, go 
in. And when you have eaten, disperse, with￾out lingering for conversation. This irritates 
the Prophet, and he shies away from you, but 
Allah does not shy away from the truth. And 
when you ask his wives for something, ask 
them from behind a screen; that is purer for 
your hearts and their hearts. You must never 
offend the Messenger of Allah, nor must you 
ever marry his wives after him, for that would 
be an enormity with Allah.
54. Whether you declare a thing, or hide it, Al￾lah is Aware of all things.
55. There is no blame on them concerning 
their fathers, or their sons, or their brothers, 
or their brothers’ sons, or their sisters’ sons, 
or their women, or their female servants. But 
they should remain conscious of Allah. Allah 
is Witness over all things.
56. Allah and His angels give blessings to the 
Prophet. O you who believe, call for blessings 
on him, and greet him with a prayer of peace.
57. Those who insult Allah and His Messen￾ger, Allah has cursed them in this life and in 
the Hereafter, and has prepared for them a 
demeaning punishment.
58. Those who harm believing men and believ￾ing women, for acts they did not commit, 
bear the burden of perjury and a flagrant sin.
59. O Prophet! Tell your wives, and your 
daughters, and the women of the believers, to 
lengthen their garments. That is more 
proper, so they will be recognized and not 
harassed. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
60. If the hypocrites, and those with sickness 
in their hearts, and the rumormongers in the 
City, do not desist, We will incite you against 
them; then they will not be your neighbors 
there except for a short while. 
61. They are cursed; wherever they are found, 
they should be captured and killed outright.
62. Such has been Allah’s precedent with those 
who passed away before. You will find no 
change in Allah’s system.
63. The people ask you about the Hour. Say, 
“The knowledge thereof rests with Allah. But 
what do you know? Perhaps the hour is near.”
64. Allah has cursed the disbelievers, and has 
prepared for them a Blaze. 
65. Dwelling therein forever, not finding a 
protector or a savior.
66. The Day when their faces are flipped into 
the Fire, they will say, “If only we had obeyed 
Allah and obeyed the Messenger.”
67. And they will say, “Lord, we have obeyed 
our superiors and our dignitaries, but they 
led us away from the way.
68. Lord, give them double the punishment, 
and curse them with a great curse.”
69. O you who believe! Do not be like those 
who abused Moses; but Allah cleared him of 
what they said. He was distinguished with Al￾lah.
160
34. SHEBA (Saba’)
70. O you who believe! Be conscious of Allah, 
and speak in a straightforward manner. 
71. He will rectify your conduct for you, and 
will forgive you your sins. Whoever obeys Al￾lah and His Messenger has won a great vic￾tory.
72. We offered the Trust to the heavens, and 
the earth, and the mountains; but they re￾fused to bear it, and were apprehensive of it; 
but the human being accepted it. He was un￾fair and ignorant.
73. Allah will punish the hypocrites, men and 
women, and the idolaters, men and women. 
And Allah will redeem the believers, men and 
women. Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Mer￾ciful.
34. SHEBA
(Saba’)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Praise be to Allah, to Whom belongs every￾thing in the heavens and the earth; and praise 
be to Him in the Hereafter. He is the Wise, 
the Expert.
2. He knows what penetrates into the earth, 
and what comes out of it, and what descends 
from the sky, and what ascends to it. He is the 
Merciful, the Forgiving.
3. Those who disbelieve say, “The Hour will 
not come upon us.” Say, “Yes indeed, by my 
Lord, it will come upon you. He is the 
Knower of the unseen.” Not an atom's weight 
in the heavens and the earth, or anything 
smaller or larger, escapes His knowledge. All 
are in a Clear Record.
4. That He may recompense those who believe 
and do good works. Those will have for￾giveness, and a generous provision.
5. As for those who strive against Our revela￾tions, seeking to undermine them—for them 
is a punishment of a painful plague.
6. Those who received knowledge know that 
what is revealed to you from your Lord is the 
truth; and it guides to the path of the Majes￾tic, the Praiseworthy.
7. Those who disbelieved said, “Shall we point 
out to you a man, who will tell you that, once 
torn into shreds, you will be in a new crea￾tion?
8. Did he invent a lie about Allah, or is there 
madness in him?” Indeed, those who do not 
believe in the Hereafter are in torment, and 
far astray.
9. Do they not reflect upon what lies before 
them and behind them, of the heaven and the 
earth? If We will, We can make the earth cave 
in beneath them, or make pieces of the sky 
fall down on them. In that is a sign for every 
devout servant.
10. We bestowed upon David favor from Us: 
“O mountains, and birds: echo with him.” 
And We softened iron for him.
11. “Make coats of armor, and measure the 
links well; and work righteousness. I am Ob￾servant of everything you do.”
12. And for Solomon the wind—its outward 
journey was one month, and its return jour￾ney was one month. And We made a spring 
of tar flow for him. And there were sprites 
that worked under him, by the leave of his 
Lord. But whoever of them swerved from 
Our command, We make him taste of the 
punishment of the Inferno.
13. They made for him whatever he wished: 
sanctuaries, statues, bowls like pools, and 
heavy cauldrons. “O House of David, work 
with appreciation,” but a few of My servants 
are appreciative.
14. Then, when We decreed death for him, 
nothing indicated his death to them except an 
earthworm eating at his staff. Then, when he 
fell down, it became clear to the sprites that, 
had they known the unseen, they would not 
have remained in the demeaning torment.
15. In Sheba’s homeland there used to be a 
wonder: two gardens, on the right, and on the 
left. “Eat of your Lord’s provision, and give 
thanks to Him.” A good land, and a forgiving 
Lord.
161
34. SHEBA (Saba’)
16. But they turned away, so We unleashed 
against them the flood of the dam; and We 
substituted their two gardens with two gar￾dens of bitter fruits, thorny shrubs, and mea￾ger harvest.
17. We thus penalized them for their ingrati￾tude. Would We penalize any but the un￾grateful?
18. Between them and the towns We had 
blessed, We placed prominent towns, and 
We made the travel between them easy. 
“Travel between them by night and day, in 
safety.”
19. But they said, “Our Lord, lengthen the dis￾tances of our journeys.” They wronged them￾selves; so We made them history, and We 
scattered them in every direction. In this are 
lessons for every steadfast and appreciative 
person.
20. Satan was correct in his assessment of 
them. They followed him, except for a group 
of believers.
21. He had no authority over them; except that 
We willed to distinguish him who believes in 
the Hereafter, from him who is doubtful 
about it. Your Lord is Guardian over all 
things.
22. Say, “Call upon those whom you claim be￾sides Allah. They possess not an atom's 
weight in the heavens or the earth, and they 
possess no share of either, and He has no 
backers from among them.”
23. Intercession with Him is of no value, ex￾cept for someone He has permitted. Until, 
when fear has subsided from their hearts, 
they will say, “What did your Lord say?” They 
will say, “The truth, and He is the High, the 
Great.”
24. Say, “Who provides for you from the heav￾ens and the earth?” Say, “Allah. And Either 
you, or we, are rightly guided, or in evident 
error.”
25. Say, “You will not be asked about our mis￾deeds, nor will we be asked about what you 
do.”
26. Say, “Our Lord will bring us together; then 
He will judge between us equitably. He is the 
All-Knowing Judge.”
27. Say, “Show me those you have attached to 
Him as associates. No indeed! But He is Al￾lah, the Powerful, the Wise.”
28. We sent you only universally to all people, 
a herald and warner, but most people do not 
know.
29. And they say, “When is this promise due, 
if you are truthful?”
30. Say, “You are promised a Day, which you 
cannot postpone by one hour, nor bring for￾ward.”
31. Those who disbelieve say, “We will never 
believe in this Quran, nor in what came be￾fore it.” If you could only see the wrongdoers, 
captive before their Lord, throwing back alle￾gations at one another. Those who were op￾pressed will say to those who were arrogant, 
“Were it not for you, we would have been be￾lievers.”
32. Those who were arrogant will say to those 
who were oppressed, “Was it us who turned 
you away from guidance when it came to 
you? No indeed, you yourselves were sinful.”
33. And those who were oppressed will say to 
those who were arrogant, “It was your 
scheming by night and day; as you instructed 
us to reject Allah, and to set up rivals to Him.” 
They will hide their remorse when they see 
the retribution. We will put yokes around the 
necks of those who disbelieved. Will they be 
repaid for anything other than what they 
used to do?
34. We sent no warner to any town, without its 
affluent saying, “We reject what you are sent 
with.”
35. And they say, “We have more wealth and 
more children, and we will not be punished.”
36. Say, “My Lord spreads out His bounty to 
whomever He wills, or restricts it; but most 
people do not know.”
37. It is neither your wealth nor your children 
that bring you closer to Us, but it is he who 
162
35. ORIGINATOR (Fatir)
believes and does good deeds. These will have 
a double reward for what they did; and they 
will reside in the Chambers, in peace and se￾curity.
38. But those who work against Our revela￾tions, seeking to undermine them—those will 
be summoned to the punishment.
39. Say, “My Lord extends the provision to 
whomever He wills of His servants, or with￾holds it. Anything you spend, He will replace 
it. He is the Best of providers.”
40. On the Day when He gathers them all to￾gether, then say to the angels, “Was it you 
these used to worship?”
41. They will say, “Be You glorified; You are 
our Master, not them. In fact, they used to 
worship the jinn, and most of them had faith 
in them.”
42. “Today, none of you has the power to 
profit or harm the other.” And We will say to 
those who did wrong, “Taste the agony of the 
Fire which you used to deny.”
43. And when Our enlightening Verses are re￾cited to them, they say, “This is nothing but a 
man who wants to divert you from what your 
ancestors used to worship.” And they say, 
“This is nothing but a fabricated lie.” And 
when the Truth comes to them, the blas￾phemers say of the Truth, “This is nothing 
but plain magic.”
44. But We gave them no book to study, and 
We did not send them any warner before you.
45. Those before them also denied the Truth, 
yet they have not attained one-tenth of what 
We had given them. They rejected My mes￾sengers, so how was My disapproval?
46. Say, “I offer you a single advice: devote 
yourselves to Allah, in pairs, or individually; 
and reflect. There is no madness in your 
friend. He is just a warner to you, before the 
advent of a severe punishment.”
47. Say, “Whatever compensation I have asked 
of you, is yours. My compensation comes 
only from Allah, and He is Witness over all 
things.”
48. Say, “My Lord projects the truth. He is the 
Knower of the Unseen.”
49. Say, “The Truth has come; while falsehood 
can neither originate, nor regenerate.”
50. Say, “If I err, I err only to my own loss; but 
if I am guided, it is by what my Lord inspires 
me. He is Hearing and Near.”
51. If you could only see when they are terri￾fied, and there is no escape, and they are 
seized from a nearby place. 
52. And they say, “We have believed in it.” But 
how can they attain it from a distant place?
53. They have rejected it in the past, and made 
allegations from a far-off place.
54. A barrier will be placed between them and 
what they desire, as was done formerly with 
their counterparts. They were in disturbing 
doubt.
35. ORIGINATOR
(Fatir)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Praise be to Allah, Originator of the heavens 
and the earth, Maker of the angels messen￾gers with wings—double, triple, and quadru￾ple. He adds to creation as He wills. Allah is 
Able to do all things.
2. Whatever mercy Allah unfolds for the peo￾ple, none can withhold it. And if He with￾holds it, none can release it thereafter. He is 
the Exalted in Power, Full of Wisdom.
3. O people! Remember Allah’s blessings 
upon you. Is there a creator other than Allah 
who provides for you from the heaven and 
the earth? There is no god but He. So how are 
you misled?
4. If they reject you, messengers before you 
were also rejected. To Allah all matters are re￾turned. 
5. O people! The promise of Allah is true; so 
let not the lowly life seduce you, and let not 
the Tempter tempt you away from Allah.
163
35. ORIGINATOR (Fatir)
6. Satan is an enemy to you, so treat him as an 
enemy. He only invites his gang to be among 
the inmates of the Inferno.
7. Those who disbelieve will suffer a harsh 
punishment, but those who believe and do 
righteous deeds will have forgiveness and a 
great reward.
8. What of him whose evil deed was made at￾tractive to him, and so he regards it as good? 
Allah leads astray whomever He wills, and He 
guides whomever He wills. Therefore, do not 
waste yourself sorrowing over them. Allah 
knows exactly what they do.
9. Allah is He who sends the winds, which ag￾itate clouds, which We drive to a dead land, 
and thereby revive the ground after it had 
died. Likewise is the Resurrection.
10. Whoever desires honor—all honor belongs 
to Allah. To Him ascends speech that is pure, 
and He elevates righteous conduct. As for 
those who plot evil, a terrible punishment 
awaits them, and the planning of these will 
fail.
11. Allah created you from dust, then from a 
small drop; then He made you pairs. No fe￾male conceives, or delivers, except with His 
knowledge. No living thing advances in years, 
or its life is shortened, except it be in a Rec￾ord. That is surely easy for Allah.
12. The two seas are not the same. One is fresh, 
sweet, good to drink, while the other is salty 
and bitter. Yet from each you eat tender meat, 
and extract jewelry which you wear. And you 
see the ships plowing through them, so that 
you may seek of His bounty, so that you may 
give thanks.
13. He merges the night into the day, and He 
merges the day into the night; and He regu￾lates the sun and the moon, each running for 
a stated term. Such is Allah, your Lord; His is 
the sovereignty. As for those you call upon 
besides Him, they do not possess a speck.
14. If you pray to them, they cannot hear your 
prayer. And even if they heard, they would 
not answer you. And on the Day of Resurrec￾tion, they will reject your partnership. None 
informs you like an Expert.
15. O people! It is you who are the poor, in 
need of Allah; while Allah is the Rich, the 
Praiseworthy.
16. If He wills, He can do away with you, and 
produce a new creation.
17. And that would not be difficult for Allah.
18. No burdened soul can carry the burden of 
another. Even if one weighted down calls for 
help with its burden, nothing can be lifted 
from it, even if they were related. You are to 
warn those who fear their Lord inwardly, and 
perform the prayer. He who purifies himself 
purifies himself for his own good. To Allah is 
the ultimate return.
19. Not equal are the blind and the seeing.
20. Nor are the darkness and the light.
21. Nor are the shade and the torrid heat. 
22. Nor are equal the living and the dead. Allah 
causes whomever He wills to hear, but you 
cannot make those in the graves hear.
23. You are only a warner.
24. We sent you with the truth; a bearer of 
good news, and a warner. There is no com￾munity but a warner has passed through it.
25. If they disbelieve you, those before them 
also disbelieved. Their messengers came to 
them with the clear proofs, with the Psalms, 
and with the Enlightening Scripture.
26. Then I seized those who disbelieved—so 
how was My rejection?
27. Have you not seen that Allah sends down 
water from the sky? With it We produce 
fruits of various colors. And in the mountains 
are streaks of white and red—varying in their 
hue—and pitch-black. 
28. Likewise, human beings, animals, and live￾stock come in various colors. From among 
His servants, the learned fear Allah. Allah is 
Almighty, Oft-Forgiving.
29. Those who recite the Book of Allah, and 
perform the prayer, and spend of what We 
164
36. YA-SEEN (Ya-Seen)
have provided for them, secretly and pub￾licly, expect a trade that will not fail.
30. He will pay them their dues in full, and will 
increase them from His bounty. He is Forgiv￾ing and Appreciative.
31. What We inspired in you, of the Book, is 
the truth, confirming what preceded it. Allah 
is Well-Informed of His servants, All-Seeing.
32. Then We passed the Book to those of Our 
servants whom We chose. Some of them 
wrong their souls, and some follow a middle 
course, and some are in the foremost in good 
deeds by Allah’s leave; that is the greatest 
blessing.
33. The Gardens of Eden, which they will en￾ter. They will be adorned therein with gold 
bracelets and pearls, and their garments 
therein will be of silk.
34. And they will say, “Praise Allah, who has 
lifted all sorrow from us. Our Lord is Most 
Forgiving, Most Appreciative.
35. He Who settled us in the Home of Perma￾nence, by His grace, where boredom will not 
touch us, and fatigue will not afflict us.”
36. As for those who disbelieve, for them is the 
Fire of Hell, wherein they will never be fin￾ished off and die, nor will its punishment be 
lightened for them. Thus We will repay every 
ingrate.
37. And they will scream therein, “Our Lord, 
let us out, and we will act righteously, differ￾ently from the way we used to act.” Did We 
not give you a life long enough, in which an￾yone who wanted to understand would have 
understood? And the warner did come to 
you. So taste. The evildoers will have no 
helper.
38. Allah is the Knower of the future of the 
heavens and the earth. He knows what the 
hearts contain.
39. It is He who made you successors on earth. 
Whoever disbelieves, his disbelief will recoil 
upon him. The disbelief of the disbelievers 
adds only to their Lord's disfavor of them. 
The disbelief of the disbelievers adds only to 
their perdition.
40. Say, “Have you considered those partners 
of yours that you worship instead of Allah? 
Show me what they have created on earth. Or 
do they have any share in the heavens?” Or 
have We given them a book whose clear 
teachings they follow? In fact, the wrongdo￾ers promise one another nothing but delu￾sions.
41. Allah holds the heavens and the earth, lest 
they fall apart. And were they to fall apart, 
there is none to hold them together except 
He. He is Most Clement, Most Forgiving.
42. And they swore by Allah with their solemn 
oaths, that if a warner came to them, they 
would be more guided than any other people. 
Yet when a warner came to them, it only in￾creased them in aversion.
43. Priding themselves on earth, and scheming 
evil. But evil scheming overwhelms none but 
its authors. Do they expect anything but the 
precedent of the ancients? You will not find 
any change in Allah’s practice, and you will 
not find any substitute to Allah’s practice.
44. Have they not journeyed in the land and 
observed the fate of those who preceded 
them? They were superior to them in 
strength. But nothing can defeat Allah in the 
heavens or on Earth. He is indeed Omnisci￾ent and Omnipotent.
45. If Allah were to punish the people for what 
they have earned, He would not leave a single 
living creature on its surface. But He defers 
them until a stated time. Then, when their 
time has arrived—Allah is Observant of His 
creatures.
36. YA-SEEN
(Ya-Seen)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Ya, Seen.
2. By the Wise Quran.
165
36. YA-SEEN (Ya-Seen)
3. You are one of the messengers.
4. On a straight path.
5. The revelation of the Almighty, the Merci￾ful.
6. To warn a people whose ancestors were not 
warned, and so they are unaware.
7. The Word was realized against most of 
them, for they do not believe.
8. We placed shackles around their necks, up 
to their chins, so they are stiff-necked.
9. And We placed a barrier in front of them, 
and a barrier behind them, and We have en￾shrouded them, so they cannot see.
10. It is the same for them, whether you warn 
them, or do not warn them—they will not be￾lieve.
11. You warn only him who follows the Mes￾sage, and fears the Most Gracious inwardly. 
So give him good news of forgiveness, and a 
generous reward.
12. It is We who revive the dead; and We write 
down what they have forwarded, and their 
traces. We have tallied all things in a Clear 
Record.
13. And cite for them the parable of the land￾lords of the town—when the messengers 
came to it.
14. We sent them two messengers, but they de￾nied them both, so We reinforced them with 
a third. They said, “We are messengers to 
you.”
15. They said, “You are nothing but humans 
like us, and the Gracious did not send down 
anything; you are only lying.”
16. They said, “Our Lord knows that we are 
messengers to you. 
17. And our only duty is clear communica￾tion.”
18. They said, “We see an evil omen in you; if 
you do not give up, we will stone you, and a 
painful punishment from us will befall you.”
19. They said, “Your evil omen is upon you. Is 
it because you were reminded? But you are an 
extravagant people.”
20. Then a man came running from the remot￾est part of the city. He said, “O my people, 
follow the messengers.
21. Follow those who ask you of no wage, and 
are themselves guided.
22. “And why should I not worship Him Who 
created me, and to Whom you will be re￾turned?
23. Shall I take other gods instead of Him? If 
the Merciful desires harm for me, their inter￾cession will not avail me at all, nor will they 
save me.
24. In that case, I would be completely lost. 
25. I have believed in your Lord, so listen to 
me.”
26. It was said, “Enter Paradise.” He said, “If 
only my people knew.
27. How my Lord has forgiven me, and made 
me one of the honored.”
28. After him, We sent down no hosts from 
heaven to his people; nor would We ever send 
any down.
29. It was just one Cry, and they were stilled.
30. Alas for the servants. No messenger ever 
came to them, but they ridiculed him.
31. Have they not considered how many gen￾erations We destroyed before them; and that 
unto them they will not return?
32. All of them, every single one of them, will 
be arraigned before Us.
33. And there is a sign for them in the dead 
land: We give it life, and produce from it 
grains from which they eat.
34. And We place in it gardens of palm-trees 
and vines, and cause springs to gush out of it.
35. That they may eat from its fruits, although
their hands did not make it. Will they not be 
appreciative?
166
36. YA-SEEN (Ya-Seen)
36. Glory be to Him who created all the pairs; 
of what the earth produces, and of their own 
selves, and of what they do not know.
37. Another sign for them is the night: We 
strip the day out of it—and they are in dark￾ness.
38. And the sun runs towards its destination. 
Such is the design of the Almighty, the All￾Knowing.
39. And the moon: We have disposed it in 
phases, until it returns like the old twig.
40. The sun is not to overtake the moon, nor is 
the night to outpace the day. Each floats in an 
orbit.
41. Another sign for them is that We carried 
their offspring in the laden Ark.
42. And We created for them the like of it, in 
which they ride.
43. If We will, We can drown them—with no 
screaming to be heard from them, nor will 
they be saved.
44. Except by a mercy from Us, and enjoyment 
for a while.
45. Yet when it is said to them, “Beware of 
what lies before you, and what lies behind 
you, that you may receive mercy.”
46. Yet never came to them a sign of their 
Lord’s signs, but they turned away from it.
47. And when it is said to them, “Spend of 
what Allah has provided for you,” those who 
disbelieve say to those who believe, “Shall we 
feed someone whom Allah could feed, if He 
so willed? You must be deeply misguided.”
48. And they say, “When will this promise be, 
if you are truthful?”
49. All they can expect is a single blast, which 
will seize them while they feud.
50. They will not be able to make a will, nor 
will they return to their families.
51. The Trumpet will be blown, then behold, 
they will rush from the tombs to their Lord.
52. They will say, “Woe to us! Who resurrected 
us from our resting-place?” This is what the 
Most Gracious had promised, and the mes￾sengers have spoken the truth.”
53. It will be but a single scream; and behold, 
they will all be brought before Us.
54. On that Day, no soul will be wronged in the 
least, and you will be recompensed only for 
what you used to do.
55. The inhabitants of Paradise, on that Day, 
will be happily busy.
56. They and their spouses, in shades, reclin￾ing on couches.
57. They will have therein fruits. They will 
have whatever they call for.
58. Peace—a saying from a Most Merciful 
Lord.
59. But step aside today, you criminals.
60. Did I not covenant with you, O Children of 
Adam, that you shall not serve the devil? That 
he is your sworn enemy?
61. And that you shall serve Me? This is a 
straight path.
62. He has misled a great multitude of you. Did 
you not understand?
63. This is Hellfire, which you were promised.
64. Roast in it today, because you persistently 
disbelieved.
65. On this Day, We will seal their mouths, and 
their hands will speak to Us, and their feet 
will testify to everything they had done.
66. If We will, We can blind their eyes as they 
rush towards the path—but how will they 
see?
67. And if We will, We can cripple them in 
their place; so they can neither move forward, 
nor go back.
68. Whomever We grant old age, We reverse 
his development. Do they not understand?
69. We did not teach him poetry, nor is it 
proper for him. It is only a reminder, and a 
Clear Quran.
70. That he may warn whoever is alive, and 
prove the Word against the faithless.
167
37. THE ALIGNERS (as-Saffat)
71. Have they not seen that We created for 
them, of Our Handiwork, livestock that they 
own?
72. And We subdued them for them. Some 
they ride, and some they eat.
73. And they have in them other benefits, and 
drinks. Will they not give thanks?
74. Yet they have taken to themselves gods 
other than Allah, that perhaps they may be 
helped.
75. They cannot help them, although they are 
arrayed as troops for them.
76. So let their words not sadden you. We 
know what they conceal, and what they re￾veal.
77. Does the human being not consider that 
We created him from a seed? Yet he becomes 
a fierce adversary.
78. And he produces arguments against Us, 
and he forgets his own creation. He says, 
“Who will revive the bones when they have 
decayed?”
79. Say, “He who initiated them in the first in￾stance will revive them. He has knowledge of 
every creation.”
80. He who produced fuel for you from the 
green trees, with which you kindle a fire.
81. Is not He who created the heavens and the 
earth able to create the like of them? Cer￾tainly. He is the Supreme All-Knowing Crea￾tor.
82. His command, when He wills a thing, is to 
say to it, “Be,” and it comes to be.
83. So glory be to Him in whose hand is the 
dominion of everything, and to Him you will 
be returned.
37. THE ALIGNERS
(as-Saffat)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. By the aligners aligning.
2. And the drivers driving.
3.And the reciters of the Reminder. 
4. Your God is indeed One.
5. Lord of the heavens and the earth, and eve￾rything between them; and Lord of the Easts.
6. We have adorned the lower heaven with the 
beauty of the planets.
7. And guarded it against every defiant devil.
8. They cannot eavesdrop on the Supernal 
Elite, for they get bombarded from every side.
9. Repelled—they will have a lingering tor￾ment.
10. Except for him who snatches a fragment—
he gets pursued by a piercing projectile.
11. Inquire of them,“Are they more difficult to 
create, or the others We created?” We created 
them from sticky clay.
12. But you wonder, and they ridicule.
13. And when reminded, they pay no atten￾tion.
14. And when they see a sign, they ridicule.
15. And they say, “This is nothing but plain 
magic.
16. When we have died and become dust and 
bones, shall we be resurrected?
17. And our ancestors of old?”
18. Say, “Yes indeed, and you will be totally 
subdued.”
19. It will be a single nudge, and they will be 
staring.
20. They will say, “Woe to us. This is the Day 
of Judgment.”
21. “This is the Day of Separation which you 
used to deny.
22. Gather those who did wrong, and their ma￾tes, and what they used to worship.
23. Besides Allah, and lead them to the way to 
Hell.
24. And stop them. They are to be questioned.”
25. What is the matter with you? Why do you 
not help one another?
168
37. THE ALIGNERS (as-Saffat)
26. In fact, on that Day, they will be submis￾sive.
27. They will come to one another, question￾ing one another.
28. They will say, “You used to come at us 
from the right.”
29. They will say, “You yourselves were not be￾lievers.
30. We had no authority over you. You your￾selves were rebellious people.
31. The Word of our Lord has been realized 
against us. We are tasting it.
32. We seduced you. We were seducers.”
33. On that Day, they will share in the punish￾ment.
34. Thus We deal with the sinners.
35. When it was said to them, “There is no god 
except Allah,” they grew arrogant.
36. And said, “Are we to abandon our gods for 
a mad poet?”
37. In fact, he came with the truth, and he con￾firmed the messengers.
38. Most assuredly, you will taste the painful 
punishment.
39. And you will be repaid only for what you 
used to do.
40. Except for Allah’s sincere servants. 
41. For them is a known provision.
42. Fruits; and they will be honored.
43. In the Gardens of Bliss.
44. On furnishings, facing one another.
45. They will be offered a cup of pure drink.
46. White; a delight to those who drink.
47. Never polluted, and never intoxicating.
48. With them will be bashful women with 
lovely eyes.
49. As if they were closely guarded pearls.
50. Then they will approach one another, 
questioning.
51. One of them will say, “I used to have a 
friend.
52. Who used to say, “Are you of those who 
believe?
53. That after we die and become dust and
bones, we will be called to account?”
54. He will say, “Will you have a look?”
55. He will look, and will see him in the pit of 
Hell.
56. He will say, “By Allah, you almost ruined 
me.
57. Were it not for the grace of my Lord, I 
would have been among the arraigned.”
58. “We will not die.
59. Except for our first death, and we will not 
be punished.”
60. This is the supreme triumph.
61. For the like of this let the workers work.
62. Is this a better hospitality, or the Tree of 
Bitterness?
63. We made it an ordeal for the unjust.
64. It is a tree that grows from the bottom of 
Hell.
65. Its fruits are like the devils’ heads.
66. They will eat from it, and fill their bellies 
with it.
67. Then, on top of it, they will have a brew of 
boiling liquid.
68. Then their return will be to the Blaze.
69. They had found their parents astray.
70. And rushed along in their footsteps.
71. And most of the ancients before them went 
astray.
72. Even though We sent messengers to warn 
them.
73. So observe the end of those who were
warned.
74. Except for the sincere servants of Allah.
75. And Noah called out to Us, and We are the 
Best of responders.
169
37. THE ALIGNERS (as-Saffat)
76. And We saved him and his family from the 
great calamity.
77. And We made his descendants the survi￾vors.
78. And We left mention of him among those 
who succeeded.
79. Peace be upon Noah among all people.
80. We thus reward the righteous.
81. He was one of Our believing servants.
82. Then We drowned the others.
83. Of his kind was Abraham.
84. When he came to his Lord with a sound 
heart.
85. He said to his father and his people, “What 
are you worshiping?
86. Is it falsified gods, instead of Allah, that you 
want?
87. So what is your opinion about the Lord of 
the Worlds?”
88. Then he took a glance at the stars.
89. And said, “I am sick.”
90. But they turned their backs on him, and 
went away. 
91. Then he turned to their gods, and said, 
“will you not eat?
92. What is it with you, that you do not speak?”
93. Then he turned on them, striking with his 
right hand.
94. And they came running towards him. 
95. He said, “Do you worship what you carve?
96. When Allah created you, and what you 
manufacture?”
97. They said, “Build a pyre for him, and throw 
him into the furnace.”
98. They wished him ill, but We made them 
the losers.
99. He said, “I am going towards my Lord, and 
He will guide me.”
100. “My Lord, give me one of the righteous.”
101. So We gave him good news of a clement 
boy.
102. Then, when he was old enough to accom￾pany him, he said, “O My son, I see in a 
dream that I am sacrificing you; see what you 
think.” He said, “O my Father, do as you are 
commanded; you will find me, Allah willing, 
one of the steadfast.”
103. Then, when they had submitted, and he 
put his forehead down.
104. We called out to him, “O Abraham!
105. You have fulfilled the vision.” Thus We re￾ward the doers of good.
106. This was certainly an evident test.
107. And We redeemed him with a great sacri￾fice.
108. And We left with him for later genera￾tions.
109. Peace be upon Abraham.
110. Thus We reward the doers of good.
111. He was one of Our believing servants.
112. And We gave him good news of Isaac, a 
prophet, one of the righteous.
113. And We blessed him, and Isaac. But 
among their descendants are some who are 
righteous, and some who are clearly unjust to 
themselves.
114. And We blessed Moses and Aaron.
115. And We delivered them and their people 
from the terrible disaster.
116. And We supported them, and so they were 
the victors.
117. And We gave them the Clarifying Scrip￾ture.
118. And We guided them upon the straight 
path.
119. And We left with them for later genera￾tions.
120. Peace be upon Moses and Aaron.
121. Thus We reward the righteous.
122. They were of Our believing servants.
170
37. THE ALIGNERS (as-Saffat)
123. Also Elijah was one of the messengers.
124. He said to his people, “Do you not fear?
125. Do you call on Baal, and forsake the Best 
of creators?
126. Allah is your Lord, and the Lord of your 
ancestors.”
127. But they called him a liar, and thus they 
will be brought forward.
128. Except for Allah’s sincere servants.
129. And We left with him for later genera￾tions.
130. Peace be upon the House of Elijah.
131. Thus We reward the virtuous.
132. He was one of Our believing servants.
133. And Lot was one of the messengers.
134. We saved him and his family, all of them.
135. Except for an old woman who lagged be￾hind.
136. Then We annihilated the others.
137. You pass by them in the morning.
138. And at night. Do you not understand?
139. And Jonah was one of the messengers.
140. When he fled to the laden boat.
141. He gambled and lost.
142. Then the fish swallowed him, and he was 
to blame.
143. Had he not been one of those who praised.
144. He would have stayed in its belly until the 
Day they are raised.
145. Then We threw him into the wilderness, 
and he was sick.
146. And We made a gourd tree grow over him.
147. Then We sent him to a hundred thousand, 
or more.
148. And they believed, so We gave them en￾joyment for a while.
149. Ask them, “Are the daughters for your 
Lord, while for them the sons?”
150. Or did We create the angels females, as 
they witnessed?”
151. No indeed! It is one of their lies when they 
say.
152. “Allah has begotten.” They are indeed ly￾ing.
153. So He preferred girls over boys?
154. What is the matter with you? How do you 
judge?
155. Will you not reflect?
156. Or do you have some clear proof?
157. Then bring your book, if you are telling 
the truth.
158. And they invented a relationship between 
Him and the jinn. But the jinn know that they 
will be arraigned.
159. Allah be glorified, far above what they al￾lege.
160. Except for Allah’s sincere servants.
161. Surely, you and what you serve.
162. Cannot seduce away from Him.
163. Except for he who will be roasting in Hell.
164. “There is not one of us but has an assigned 
position.
165. And we are the arrangers.
166. And we are the glorifiers.”
167. Even though they used to say.
168. “Had we received advice from the an￾cients.
169. We would have been Allah's faithful serv￾ants.”
170. But they rejected it, so they will find out.
171. Our Word has already gone out to our 
servant messengers.
172. It is they who will be supported.
173. And Our troops will be the victors.
174. So disregard them for a while.
175. And watch them—they will soon see.
176. Are they seeking to hasten Our punish￾ment?
171
38. SAAD (Saad)
177. When it descends into their yard, misera￾ble will be the morning of those forewarned.
178. So avoid them for a while.
179. And watch—they will soon see.
180. Exalted be your Lord, the Lord of Glory, 
beyond their allegations.
181. And peace be upon the messengers.
182. And praise be to Allah, the Lord of the 
Worlds.
38. SAAD
(Saad)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Saad. By the renowned Quran.
2. Those who disbelieve are steeped in arro￾gance and defiance.
3. How many generations have We destroyed 
before them? They cried out when it was too 
late to escape.
4. And they marveled that a warner has come 
to them from among them. The disbelievers 
said, “This is a lying magician.”
5. “Did he turn all the gods into one God? This 
is something strange.”
6. The notables among them announced: “Go 
on, and hold fast to your gods. This is some￾thing planned.
7. We never heard of this in the former faith. 
This is nothing but a fabrication.
8. Was the message sent down to him, out of 
all of us?” In fact, they are doubtful of My 
warning. In fact, they have not yet tasted My 
punishment.
9. Or do they possess the treasuries of the 
mercy of your Lord—the Majestic, the Giver?
10. Or do they possess the sovereignty of the 
heavens and the earth and what is between 
them? Then let them ascend the ropes.
11. An army of confederates will be defeated 
there.
12. Before them the people of Noah denied the 
truth; as did Aad, and Pharaoh of the Stakes.
13. And Thamood, and the people of Lot, and 
the dwellers of the Woods—these were the 
confederates.
14. None of them but denied the messengers, 
so My retribution was deserved.
15. These can expect only a single scream, 
from which there is no recovery.
16. And they say, “Our Lord, hasten Your writ 
upon us, before the Day of Account.”
17. Be patient in the face of what they say, and 
mention Our servant David, the resourceful. 
He was obedient.
18. We committed the mountains to glorify 
with him, in the evening and at daybreak.
19. And the birds, gathered together. All obe￾dient to him. 
20. And We strengthened his kingdom, and 
gave him wisdom and decisive speech.
21. Has the story of the two disputants reached 
you? When they scaled the sanctuary?
22. When they entered upon David, and he 
was startled by them. They said, “Do not fear. 
Two disputants; one of us has wronged the 
other; so judge between us fairly, and do not 
be biased, and guide us to the straight way.”
23. “This brother of mine has ninety nine 
ewes, and I have one ewe, and he said, ‘En￾trust it to me,’ and he pressured me with 
words.”
24. He said, “He has done you wrong by asking 
your ewe in addition to his ewes. Many part￾ners take advantage of one another, except 
those who believe and do good deeds, but 
these are so few.” David realized that We 
were testing him, so he sought forgiveness 
from his Lord, and fell down to his knees, and 
repented.
25. So We forgave him that. And for him is 
nearness to Us, and a good place of return.
26. “O David, We made you a ruler in the land, 
so judge between the people with justice, and 
do not follow desire, lest it diverts you from 
172
38. SAAD (Saad)
Allah’s path. Those who stray from Allah’s 
path will have a painful punishment, for hav￾ing ignored the Day of Account.”
27. We did not create the heaven and the earth 
and everything between them in vain. That is 
the assumption of those who disbelieve—so 
woe to those who disbelieve because of the 
Fire.
28. Or are We to treat those who believe and 
do righteous deeds like those who make trou￾ble on earth? Or are We to treat the pious like 
the shameless?
29. A blessed Book that We sent down to you, 
that they may ponder its Verses, and for those 
with intelligence to take heed.
30. And We granted David, Solomon, an ex￾cellent servant. He was penitent.
31. When the beautiful horses were paraded 
before him in the evening.
32. He said, “I have preferred the love of nice￾ties to the remembrance of my Lord—until it 
disappeared behind the veil.
33. Bring them back to me.” And he began ca￾ressing their legs and necks.
34. We tested Solomon, and placed a body on 
his throne; then he repented.
35. He said, “My Lord, forgive me, and grant 
me a kingdom never to be attained by anyone 
after me. You are the Giver.”
36. So We placed the wind at his service, blow￾ing gently by his command, wherever he di￾rected.
37. And the demons—every builder and diver.
38. And others fettered in chains.
39. “This is Our gift; so give generously, or 
withhold; without account.”
40. For him is nearness to Us, and a beautiful 
resort.
41. And mention Our servant Job, when he 
called out to his Lord, “Satan has afflicted me 
with hardship and pain.”
42. “Stamp with your foot—here is cool water 
to wash with, and to drink.”
43. And We restored his family for him, and 
their like with them; as a mercy from Us, and 
a lesson for those who possess insight.
44. “Take with your hand a bundle, and strike 
with it, and do not break your oath.” We 
found him patient. What an excellent serv￾ant! He was obedient.
45. And mention Our servants Abraham, 
Isaac, and Jacob—endowed with ability and 
vision.
46. We distinguished them with a distinct 
quality: the remembrance of the Home.
47. To Us they are among the chosen, the out￾standing.
48. And mention Ishmael, Elisha, and Ezekiel; 
all are among the outstanding.
49. This is a reminder. The devout will have a 
good place of return.
50. The Gardens of Eden, with their doors 
wide-open for them.
51. Relaxing therein, and calling for abundant 
fruit and beverage.
52. With them will be attendants with modest 
gaze, of same age.
53. This is what you are promised for the Day 
of Account.
54. Such is Our bounty, inexhaustible. 
55. All This. But the transgressors will have a 
miserable return.
56. Hell; in which they will roast; what a mis￾erable abode!
57. All this. Let them taste it—boiling and bit￾ter cold.
58. And similar torments of diverse kinds.
59. “This is a crowd rushing headlong with 
you.” There is no welcome for them. They 
will be scorched by the Fire.
60. They will say, “But it is you! There is no 
welcome for you! It is you who brought it 
upon us! What a miserable end!”
61. They will say, “Our Lord, whoever brought 
this upon us, give him double torment in the 
Fire.”
173
39. THRONGS (az-Zumar)
62. And they will say, “What is it with us that 
we do not see men we used to count among 
the wicked?
63. Did we take them for mockery, or have our 
eyes swerved from them?
64. This is certainly true—the feuding of the 
people of the Fire.
65. Say, “I am only a warner, and there is no 
god except Allah—the One, the Conqueror.
66. The Lord of the heavens and the earth, and 
everything between them; the Mighty, the 
Forgiver.”
67. Say, “It is a message of great importance.
68. From which you are turning away.
69. I have no knowledge of the Highest Assem￾bly as they dispute.
70. It is only revealed to me that I am a clear 
warner.”
71. Your Lord said to the angels, “I am creating 
a human being from clay.
72. When I have formed him, and breathed 
into him of My spirit, fall prostrate before 
him.
73. So the angels fell prostrate, all of them.
74. Except for Satan. He was too proud, and 
one of the faithless.
75. He said, “O Satan, what prevented you 
from prostrating before what I created with 
My Own hands? Are you too proud, or were 
you one of the exalted?”
76. He said, “I am better than he; You created 
me from fire, and You created him from 
clay.”
77. He said, “Then get out of here! You are an 
outcast!
78. And My curse will be upon you until the 
Day of Judgment.”
79. He said, “Lord, defer me until the Day they 
are resurrected.”
80. He said, “You are one of those deferred.
81. Until the Day of the Time Appointed.”
82. He said, “By Your majesty, I will seduce 
them all.
83. Except for your loyal servants among 
them.”
84. He said, “The truth is, and I say the truth.
85. I will fill Hell with you, and with every one 
of them who follows you.”
86. Say, “I ask of you no wage for this, and I am 
not a pretender.
87. It is but a reminder to mankind.
88. And you will know its message after a 
while.”
39. THRONGS
(az-Zumar)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. The revelation of the Book is from Allah, the 
Mighty and Wise.
2. We sent down to you the Book with the 
truth, so serve Allah, devoting your religion 
to Him.
3. Is not to Allah that sincere faith is due? As 
for those who take guardians besides Him, 
“We only worship them that they may bring 
us nearer to Allah.” Allah will judge between 
them regarding their differences. Allah does 
not guide the lying blasphemer.
4. If Allah wanted to have a son, He could have 
selected from His creation at will. Glory be to 
Him. He is Allah, the One, the Prevailing.
5. He created the heavens and the earth with 
reason. He wraps the night around the day, 
and He wraps the day around the night. And 
He regulates the sun and the moon, each run￾ning along a specific course. He is indeed the 
Almighty, the Forgiver.
6. He created you from one person, then made 
from it its mate, and brought down livestock 
for you—eight kinds in pairs. He creates you 
in the wombs of your mothers, in successive 
174
39. THRONGS (az-Zumar)
formations, in a triple darkness. Such is Al￾lah, your Lord. His is the kingdom. There is 
no god but He. So what made you deviate?
7. If you disbelieve, Allah is Independent of 
you, yet He does not approve ingratitude on 
the part of His servants. And if you are thank￾ful, He will approve that in you. No bearer of 
burden can bear the burden of another. Then 
to your Lord is your return; and He will in￾form you of what you used to do. He is aware 
of what the hearts contain.
8. When some adversity touches the human 
being, he prays to his Lord, repenting to Him. 
But then, when He confers on him a grace of 
His, he forgets what he was praying for be￾fore, and he attributes rivals to Allah, in order 
to lead astray from His way. Say, “Enjoy your 
disbelief for a little while; you will be among 
the inmates of the Fire.”
9. Is he who worships devoutly during the 
watches of the night, prostrating himself and 
standing up, mindful of the Hereafter, and 
placing his hope in the mercy of his Lord? 
Say, “Are those who know and those who do 
not know equal?” Only those possessed of 
reason will remember.
10. Say, “O My devotees who have believed, 
keep your duty to your Lord. For those who 
do good in this world, is goodness. And Al￾lah’s earth is vast. The steadfast will be paid 
their wages in full, without reckoning.”
11. Say, “I was commanded to serve Allah, de￾voting my religion exclusively to Him.
12. And I was commanded to be the first of 
those who submit.”
13. Say, “I fear, if I disobeyed my Lord, the 
punishment of a horrendous Day.”
14. Say, “It is Allah I worship, sincere in my 
faith in Him.”
15. “But you can worship whatever you wish 
besides Him.” Say, “The losers are those who 
lose their souls and their people on the Day 
of Resurrection.” That is indeed the obvious 
loss.
16. They will have layers of Fire above them, 
and layers beneath them. That is how Allah 
strikes fear into His servants—“O My serv￾ants! Beware of Me!”
17. As for those who avoid the worship of 
idols, and devote themselves to Allah—theirs 
is the good news. So give good news to My 
servants.
18. Those who listen to the Word, and follow 
the best of it. These are they whom Allah has 
guided. These are they who possess intellect.
19. What about someone who has deserved the 
sentence of punishment? Is it you who can 
save those in the Fire?
20. But those who fear their Lord will have 
mansions upon mansions, built high, with 
streams flowing beneath them. The promise 
of Allah; and Allah never breaks a promise.
21. Have you not considered how Allah sends 
down water from the sky, then He makes it 
flow into underground wells, then He pro￾duces with it plants of various colors, then 
they wither and you see them yellowing, then 
He turns them into debris? Surely in this is a
reminder for those with understanding.
22. What about someone whose heart Allah 
has opened to Islam, so that he follows a light 
from His Lord? Woe to those whose hearts 
are hardened against the mention of Allah. 
Those are in manifest error.
23. Allah has sent down the best of narrations: 
a Scripture consistent and paired. The skins 
of those who reverence their Lord shiver 
from it, then their skins and their hearts sof￾ten up to the remembrance of Allah. Such is 
Allah’s guidance; He guides with it whom￾ever He wills. But whomever Allah leaves 
astray, for him there is no guide.
24. What about someone who covers his face 
against the terrible misery of the Day of Res￾urrection? To the evildoers it will be said, 
“Taste what you used to earn.”
25. Those before them also denied the truth, so 
the penalty came upon them from where they 
did not perceive.
175
39. THRONGS (az-Zumar)
26. Allah made them taste disgrace in the pre￾sent life, but the punishment of the Hereafter 
is worse, if they only knew.
27. We have cited in this Quran for mankind 
every ideal, that they may take heed.
28. An Arabic Quran, without any defect, so 
they may become righteous.
29. Allah cites the example of a man shared by 
partners at odds, and a man belonging exclu￾sively to one man. Are they equal in status? 
Praise be to Allah, but most of them do not 
know.
30. You will die, and they will die.
31. Then, on the Day of Resurrection, you will 
be quarrelling before your Lord.
32. Who is more evil than he who lies about 
Allah, and denies the truth when it has come 
to him? Is there not in Hell room for the un￾grateful?
33. But he who promotes the truth, and testi￾fies to it—these are the righteous.
34. They will have whatever they please with 
their Lord. Such is the reward for the virtu￾ous.
35. Allah will acquit them of the worst of their 
deeds, and will reward them according to the 
best of what they used to do.
36. Is Allah not enough for His servant? And 
they frighten you with those besides Him. 
Whomever Allah sends astray, for him there 
is no guide.
37. And whomever Allah guides, for him there 
is no misleader. Is Allah not Powerful and 
Vengeful?
38. And if you asked them, “Who created the 
heavens and the earth?” they would say, “Al￾lah.” Say, “Have you seen those you pray to 
instead of Allah? If Allah willed any harm for 
me, can they lift His harm? And if He willed 
a blessing for me, can they hold back His 
mercy?” Say, “Allah suffices for me. On Him 
the reliant rely.”
39. Say: “O my people, work according to your 
ability; and so will I. Then you will know.
40. Who will receive a humiliating punish￾ment, and on whom will fall a lasting tor￾ment.”
41. We sent down upon you the Book for man￾kind in truth. He who follows guidance does 
so for the good of his soul. And he who strays 
in error does so to its detriment. You are not 
their overseer.
42. Allah takes the souls at the time of their 
death, and those that have not died during 
their sleep. He retains those for which He has 
decreed death, and He releases the others un￾til a predetermined time. In that are signs for 
people who reflect.
43. Or have they chosen intercessors other 
than Allah? Say, “Even though they have no 
power over anything, and are devoid of rea￾son?”
44. Say, “All intercession is up to Allah. To 
Him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and 
the earth. Then to Him you will be returned.”
45. When Allah alone is mentioned, the hearts 
of those who do not believe in the Hereafter 
shrink with resentment. But when those 
other than Him are mentioned, they become 
filled with joy.
46. Say, “Our God, Initiator of the heavens and 
the earth, Knower of all secrets and declara￾tions. You will judge between your servants 
regarding what they had differed about.”
47. If those who did wrong owned everything 
on earth, and the like of it with it, they would 
redeem themselves with it from the terrible 
suffering on the Day of Resurrection. But 
there will appear to them from Allah what 
they never anticipated. 
48. There will appear to them the evils of their 
deeds, and they will be surrounded by what 
they used to ridicule.
49. When adversity touches the human being, 
he calls on Us. But then, when We favor him 
with a blessing from Us, he says, “I have at￾tained this by virtue of my knowledge.” How￾ever, it is a test, but most of them do not 
know.
176
39. THRONGS (az-Zumar)
50. Those before them said it, but what they 
had earned did not avail them.
51. The evils of their deeds caught up with 
them. And the wrongdoers among these will 
also be afflicted by the evils of what they 
earned, and they cannot prevent it.
52. Do they not know that Allah extends the 
provision to whomever He wills, and con￾stricts it? In that are signs for people who be￾lieve.
53. Say, “O My servants who have transgressed 
against themselves: do not despair of Allah’s 
mercy, for Allah forgives all sins. He is indeed 
the Forgiver, the Clement.”
54. And turn to your Lord, and submit to Him, 
before the retribution comes upon you. Then 
you will not be helped.
55. And follow the best of what was revealed to 
you from your Lord, before the punishment 
comes upon you suddenly, while you are un￾aware.
56. So that a soul may not say, “How sorry I 
am, for having neglected my duty to Allah, 
and for having been of the scoffers.”
57. Or say, “Had Allah guided me; I would 
have been of the pious.”
58. Or say, when it sees the penalty, “If only I 
had another chance, I would be of the virtu￾ous.”
59. Yes indeed! My Verses did come to you, 
but you called them lies, turned arrogant, and 
were of the faithless.
60. On the Day of Resurrection, you will see 
those who told lies about Allah with their 
faces blackened. Is there not a place in Hell 
for the arrogant?
61. And Allah will save those who maintained 
righteousness to their place of salvation. No 
harm will touch them, nor will they grieve.
62. Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is 
in Charge of all things.
63. To Him belong the reins of the heavens 
and the earth. But those who blaspheme 
against the revelations of Allah—it is they 
who are the losers.
64. Say, “Is it other than Allah you instruct me 
to worship, you ignorant ones?”
65. It was revealed to you, and to those before 
you, that if you idolize, your works will be in 
vain, and you will be of the losers.
66. Rather, worship Allah, and be of the appre￾ciative.
67. They have not esteemed Allah as He ought 
to be esteemed. The entire earth will be in His 
grip on the Day of Resurrection, and the
heavens will be folded in His right. Immacu￾late is He, and Transcendent He is beyond the 
associations they make. 
68. And the Trumpet will be sounded, where￾upon everyone in the heavens and the earth 
will be stunned, except whomever Allah wills. 
Then it will be sounded another time, where￾upon they will rise up, looking on.
69. And the earth will shine with the Light of 
its Lord; and the Book will be put in place; 
and the prophets and the witnesses will be 
brought in; and Judgment will be passed 
among them equitably, and they will not be 
wronged.
70. And every soul will be fully compensated 
for what it had done. He is well aware of what 
they do.
71. Those who disbelieved will be driven to 
Hell in throngs. Until, when they have 
reached it, and its gates are opened, its keep￾ers will say to them, “Did not messengers 
from among you come to you, reciting to you 
the revelations of your Lord, and warning 
you of the meeting of this Day of yours?” 
They will say, “Yes, but the verdict of punish￾ment is justified against the disbelievers.”
72. It will be said, “Enter the gates of Hell, to 
abide therein eternally.” How wretched is the 
destination of the arrogant.
73. And those who feared their Lord will be led 
to Paradise in throngs. Until, when they have 
reached it, and its gates are opened, its keep￾ers will say to them, “Peace be upon you, you 
177
40. FORGIVER (Ghafir)
have been good, so enter it, to abide therein 
eternally.”
74. And they will say, “Praise be to Allah, who 
has fulfilled His promise to us, and made us 
inherit the land, enjoying Paradise as we 
please.” How excellent is the reward of the 
workers.
75. And you will see the angels hovering 
around the Throne, glorifying their Lord 
with praise. And it will be judged between 
them equitably, and it will be said, “Praise be 
to Allah, Lord of the Worlds.”
40. FORGIVER
(Ghafir)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Ha, Meem.
2. The sending down of the Scripture is from 
Allah the Almighty, the Omniscient.
3. Forgiver of sins, Accepter of repentance, Se￾vere in punishment, Bountiful in bounty. 
There is no god but He. To Him is the ulti￾mate return.
4. None argues against Allah’s revelations ex￾cept those who disbelieve. So do not be im￾pressed by their activities in the land.
5. Before them the people of Noah rejected the 
truth, as did the confederates after them. 
Every community plotted against their mes￾senger, to capture him. And they argued with 
falsehood, to defeat with it the truth. But I 
seized them. What a punishment it was!
6. Thus the sentence of your Lord became re￾alized against those who disbelieve, that they 
are to be inmates of the Fire.
7. Those who carry the Throne, and those 
around it, glorify their Lord with praise, and 
believe in Him, and ask for forgiveness for 
those who believe: “Our Lord, You have en￾compassed everything in mercy and 
knowledge; so forgive those who repent and 
follow Your path, and protect them from the 
agony of the Blaze.
8. And admit them, Our Lord, into the Gar￾dens of Eternity, which You have promised 
them, and the righteous among their parents, 
and their spouses, and their offspring. You 
are indeed the Almighty, the Most Wise.
9. And shield them from the evil deeds. 
Whomever You shield from the evil deeds, 
on that Day, You have had mercy on him. 
That is the supreme achievement.”
10. Those who disbelieved will be addressed, 
“The loathing of Allah is greater than your 
loathing of yourselves—for you were invited 
to the faith, but you refused.”
11. They will say, “Our Lord, you made us die 
twice, and twice you gave us life. Now we 
acknowledge our sins. Is there any way out?”
12. That is because when Allah alone was 
called upon, you disbelieved; but when others 
were associated with Him, you believed. 
Judgment rests with Allah the Sublime, the 
Majestic.
13. It is He who shows you His wonders, and 
sends down sustenance from the sky for you. 
But none pays heed except the repentant.
14. So call upon Allah, with sincere devotion to 
Him, even though the disbelievers resent it.
15. Exalted in rank, Owner of the Throne. He 
conveys the Spirit, by His command, upon 
whomever He wills of His servants, to warn 
of the Day of Encounter.
16. The Day when they will emerge, nothing 
about them will be concealed from Allah. “To 
whom does the sovereignty belong today?” 
“To Allah, the One, the Irresistible.”
17. On that Day, every soul will be recom￾pensed for what it had earned. There will be 
no injustice on that Day. Allah is quick to set￾tle accounts.
18. And warn them of the Day of Imminence, 
when the hearts are at the throats, choking 
them. The evildoers will have no intimate 
friend, and no intercessor to be obeyed.
19. He knows the deceptions of the eyes, and 
what the hearts conceal. 
178
40. FORGIVER (Ghafir)
20. Allah judges with justice, while those 
whom they invoke besides Him cannot judge 
with anything. It is Allah who is the Hearing, 
the Seeing.
21. Have they not travelled through the earth, 
and seen the consequences for those before 
them? They were stronger than them, and 
they left more impact on earth. But Allah 
seized them for their sins, and they had no 
defender against Allah.
22. That is because their messengers used to 
come to them with clear proofs, but they dis￾believed, so Allah seized them. He is Strong, 
Severe in retribution.
23. We sent Moses with Our signs, and a clear 
authority.
24. To Pharaoh, Hamaan, and Quaroon. But 
they said, “A lying sorcerer.”
25. Then, when he came to them with the truth 
from Us, they said, “Kill the sons of those 
who have believed with him, and spare their 
daughters.” But the scheming of the unbe￾lievers can only go astray.
26. Pharaoh said, “Leave me to kill Moses, and 
let him appeal to his Lord. I fear he may 
change your religion, or spread disorder in 
the land.”
27. Moses said, “I have sought the protection 
of my Lord and your Lord, from every tyrant 
who does not believe in the Day of Account.”
28. A believing man from Pharaoh's family, 
who had concealed his faith, said, “Are you 
going to kill a man for saying, `My Lord is 
Allah,’ and he has brought you clear proofs 
from your Lord? If he is a liar, his lying will 
rebound upon him; but if he is truthful, then 
some of what he promises you will befall you. 
Allah does not guide the extravagant im￾poster.
29. O my people! Yours is the dominion today, 
supreme in the land; but who will help us 
against Allah’s might, should it fall upon us?” 
Pharaoh said, “I do not show you except what 
I see, and I do not guide you except to the 
path of prudence.”
30. The one who had believed said, “O my peo￾ple, I fear for you the like of the day of the 
confederates.
31. Like the fate of the people of Noah, and 
Aad, and Thamood, and those after them. Al￾lah wants no injustice for the servants.
32. O my people, I fear for you the Day of Call￾ing Out.
33. The Day when you will turn and flee, hav￾ing no defender against Allah. Whomever Al￾lah misguides has no guide.”
34. Joseph had come to you with clear revela￾tions, but you continued to doubt what he 
came to you with. Until, when he perished, 
you said, “Allah will never send a messenger 
after him.” Thus Allah leads astray the outra￾geous skeptic.
35. Those who argue against Allah’s revela￾tions, without any proof having come to 
them—a heinous sin in the sight of Allah, and 
of those who believe. Thus Allah seals the 
heart of every proud bully.
36. And Pharaoh said, “O Hamaan, build me a 
tower, that I may reach the pathways.
37. The pathways of the heavens, so that I may 
glance at the God of Moses; though I think he 
is lying.” Thus Pharaoh’s evil deeds were 
made to appear good to him, and he was 
averted from the path. Pharaoh's guile was 
only in defeat.
38. The one who had believed said,“O my peo￾ple, follow me, and I will guide you to the 
path of rectitude.”
39. “O my people, the life of this world is noth￾ing but fleeting enjoyment, but the Hereafter 
is the Home of Permanence.
40. Whoever commits a sin will be repaid only 
with its like. But whoever works righteous￾ness, whether male or female, and is a be￾liever—these will enter Paradise, where they 
will be provided for without account.
41. O my people, how is it that I call you to sal￾vation, and you call me to the Fire?
179
40. FORGIVER (Ghafir)
42. You call me to reject Allah, and to associate 
with Him what I have no knowledge of, while 
I call you to the Mighty Forgiver.
43. Without a doubt, what you call me to has 
no say in this world, or in the Hereafter; and 
our turning back is to Allah; and the trans￾gressors are the inmates of the Fire.
44. You will remember what I am telling you, 
so I commit my case to Allah. Allah is Ob￾servant of the servants.”
45. So Allah protected him from the evils of 
their scheming, while a terrible torment be￾sieged Pharaoh’s clan.
46. The Fire. They will be exposed to it morn￾ing and evening. And on the Day the Hour 
takes place: “Admit the clan of Pharaoh to the 
most intense agony.”
47. As they quarrel in the Fire, the weak will 
say to those who were arrogant, “We were 
followers of yours; will you then spare us a 
portion of the Fire?”
48. Those who were arrogant will say, “We are 
all in it; Allah has judged between the serv￾ants.”
49. And those in the Fire will say to the keepers 
of Hell, “Call to your Lord to lessen our suf￾fering for one day.”
50. They will say, “Did not your messengers 
come to you with clear signs?” They will say, 
“Yes.” They will say, “Then pray, but the 
prayers of the disbelievers will always be in 
vain.”
51. Most surely We will support Our messen￾gers and those who believe, in this life, and on 
the Day the witnesses arise.
52. The Day when their excuses will not profit 
the wrongdoers, and the curse will be upon 
them, and they will have the Home of Misery.
53. We gave Moses guidance, and made the 
Children of Israel inherit the Scripture.
54. A guide and a reminder for those endowed 
with reason.
55. So be patient. The promise of Allah is true. 
And ask forgiveness for your sin, and pro￾claim the praise of your Lord evening and 
morning.
56. Those who dispute regarding Allah’s reve￾lations without any authority having come to 
them—there is nothing in their hearts but the 
feeling of greatness, which they will never at￾tain. So seek refuge in Allah; for He is the All￾Hearing, the All-Seeing.
57. Certainly the creation of the heavens and 
the earth is greater than the creation of hu￾manity, but most people do not know.
58. Not equal are the blind and the seeing. Nor 
are those who believe and work righteousness 
equal to the sinners. How little you reflect.
59. Indeed, the Hour is coming; there is no 
doubt about it; but most people do not be￾lieve.
60. Your Lord has said, “Pray to Me, and I will 
respond to you. But those who are too proud 
to worship Me will enter Hell forcibly.”
61. It is Allah Who made the night for you, that 
you may rest therein; and the day allowing 
sight. Allah is gracious towards the people, 
but most people do not give thanks.
62. Such is Allah, your Lord, Creator of all 
things. There is no god except Him; so how 
could you turn away?
63. Thus are turned away those who dispute 
the signs of Allah.
64. It is Allah who made the earth a habitat for 
you, and the sky a structure. And He de￾signed you, and designed you well; and He 
provided you with the good things. Such is 
Allah, your Lord; so Blessed is Allah, Lord of 
the Worlds.
65. He is the Living One. There is no god ex￾cept He. So pray to Him, devoting your reli￾gion to Him. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of 
the Worlds.
66. Say, “I was prohibited from worshiping 
those you invoke besides Allah, now that 
clear revelations have come to me from my 
180
41. DETAILED (Fussilat)
Lord; and I was commanded to submit to the 
Lord of the Worlds.”
67. It is He who created you from dust, then 
from a seed, then from an embryo, then He 
brings you out as an infant, then He lets you 
reach your maturity, then you become el￾derly—although some of you die sooner—so 
that you may reach a predetermined age, so 
that you may understand.
68. It is He who gives life and death; and when 
He decides on a thing, He just says to it, “Be,” 
and it comes to be.
69. Have you not observed those who dispute 
regarding Allah's revelations, how they have 
deviated?
70. Those who call the Book a lie, and what We 
sent Our messengers with—they will surely 
know.
71. When the yokes are around their necks, 
and they will be dragged by the chains.
72. Into the boiling water, then in the Fire they 
will be consumed.
73. Then it will be said to them, “Where are 
those you used to deify?
74. Instead of Allah?” They will say, “They 
have abandoned us. In fact, we were praying 
to nothing before.” Thus Allah sends the dis￾believers astray.
75. That is because you used to rejoice on earth 
in other than the truth, and because you used 
to behave with vanity.
76. Enter the gates of Hell, to remain therein 
forever. What a terrible dwelling for the arro￾gant.
77. So be patient. The promise of Allah is true. 
Whether We show you some of what We 
have promised them, or take you to Us, to Us 
they will be returned.
78. We sent messengers before you. Some of 
them We told you about, and some We did 
not tell you about. No messenger can bring a 
miracle except by leave of Allah. Then, when 
the command of Allah is issued, fair judg￾ment will be passed, and there and then the 
seekers of vanity will lose.
79. Allah is He who created the domestic ani￾mals for you—some for you to ride, and some 
you eat.
80. And in them you have other benefits as 
well, and through them you satisfy your 
needs. And on them, and on the ships, you 
are transported.
81. And He shows you His signs. So which of 
Allah’s signs will you deny?
82. Have they not journeyed through the land, 
and seen the outcome for those before them? 
They were more numerous than they, and 
had greater power and influence in the land. 
But what they had achieved availed them 
nothing.
83. When their messengers came to them with 
clear proofs, they rejoiced in the knowledge 
they had, and the very things they used to rid￾icule besieged them.
84. Then, when they witnessed Our might, 
they said, “We believe in Allah alone, and we 
reject what we used to associate with Him.”
85. But their faith could not help them once 
they witnessed Our might. This has been Al￾lah’s way of dealing with His servants. And 
there and then the disbelievers lost.
41. DETAILED
(Fussilat)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Ha, Meem.
2. A revelation from the Most Gracious, the 
Most Merciful.
3. A Scripture whose Verses are detailed, a 
Quran in Arabic for people who know.
4. Bringing good news, and giving warnings. 
But most of them turn away, so they do not 
listen.
5. And they say, “Our hearts are screened 
from what you call us to, and in our ears is 
deafness, and between us and you is a barrier. 
So do what you want, and so will we.”
181
41. DETAILED (Fussilat)
6. Say, “I am only a human like you; it is in￾spired in me that your God is One God. So be 
upright towards Him, and seek forgiveness 
from Him.” And woe to the idolaters.
7. Those who do not pay the alms; and regard￾ing the Hereafter, they are disbelievers.
8. As for those who believe and do righteous 
deeds—for them is a reward uninterrupted.
9. Say, “Do you reject the One who created the 
earth in two days? And you attribute equals 
to Him? That is the Lord of the Universe.”
10. He placed stabilizers over it; and blessed it; 
and planned its provisions in four days, 
equally to the seekers.
11. Then He turned to the sky, and it was 
smoke, and said to it and to the earth, “Come, 
willingly or unwillingly.” They said, “We 
come willingly.”
12. So He completed them as seven universes 
in two days, and He assigned to each universe 
its laws. And We decorated the lower uni￾verse with lamps, and for protection. That is 
the design of the Almighty, the All-Knowing.
13. But if they turn away, say, “I have warned 
you of a thunderbolt, like the thunderbolt of 
Aad and Thamood.”
14. Their messengers came to them, from be￾fore them and from behind them, saying, “Do 
not worship anyone but Allah.” They said, 
“Had our Lord willed, He would have sent 
down angels; Therefore, we reject what you 
are sent with.”
15. As for Aad, they turned arrogant on earth, 
and opposed justice, and said, “Who is more 
powerful than us?” Have they not considered 
that Allah, who created them, is more power￾ful than they? And they went on denying Our 
revelations.
16. So We unleashed upon them a screaming 
wind, for a few miserable days, to make them 
taste the punishment of shame in this life; but 
the punishment of the Hereafter is more 
shameful; and they will not be saved.
17. And as for Thamood, We guided them, but 
they preferred blindness over guidance. So 
the thunderbolt of the humiliating punish￾ment seized them, because of what they used 
to earn.
18. And We saved those who believed and 
were righteous.
19. The Day when Allah’s enemies are herded 
into the Fire, forcibly.
20. Until, when they have reached it, their 
hearing, and their sight, and their skins will 
testify against them regarding what they used 
to do.
21. And they will say to their skins, “Why did 
you testify against us?” They will say, “Allah, 
Who made all things speak, made us speak. It 
is He who created you the first time, and to 
Him you are returned.”
22. You were unable to hide yourselves from 
your hearing, and your sight, and your skins, 
to prevent them from testifying against you, 
and you imagined that Allah was unaware of 
much of what you do.
23. It is that thought of yours about your Lord 
that led you to ruin—so you became of the 
losers.
24. If they endure patiently, the Fire will be 
their residence; and if they make up excuses, 
they will not be pardoned.
25. We had assigned companions for them, 
who glamorized to them what was in front of 
them, and what was behind them. And the 
Word proved true against them in communi￾ties of jinn and humans that have passed 
away before them. They were losers.
26. Those who disbelieve say, “Do not listen to 
this Quran, and talk over it, so that you may 
prevail.”
27. We will make those who disbelieve taste an 
intense agony, and We will recompense them 
according to the worst of what they used to 
do.
28. Such is the recompense of Allah’s ene￾mies—the Fire—where they will have their 
permanent home, in recompense for having 
disregarded Our revelations.
182
41. DETAILED (Fussilat)
29. Those who disbelieved will say, “Our Lord, 
show us those who led us astray—among jinn 
and humans—and we will trample them un￾der our feet, so they become of the lowest.”
30. Surely, those who say: “Our Lord is Allah,” 
and then go straight, the angels will descend 
upon them: “Do not fear, and do not grieve, 
but rejoice in the news of the Garden which 
you were promised.
31. We are your allies in this life and in the 
Hereafter, wherein you will have whatever 
your souls desire, and you will have therein 
whatever you call for.
32. As Hospitality from an All-Forgiving, 
Merciful One.”
33. And who is better in speech than someone 
who calls to Allah, and acts with integrity, 
and says, “I am of those who submit”?
34. Good and evil are not equal. Repel evil with 
good, and the person who was your enemy 
becomes like an intimate friend.
35. But none will attain it except those who 
persevere, and none will attain it except the 
very fortunate.
36. When a temptation from the Devil pro￾vokes you, seek refuge in Allah; He is the 
Hearer, the Knower.
37. And of His signs are the night and the day, 
and the sun and the moon. Do not bow down 
to the sun, nor to the moon, but bow down to 
Allah, Who created them both, if it is Him 
that you serve.
38. But if they are too proud—those in the
presence of your Lord praise Him night and 
day, and without ever tiring.
39. And of His signs is that you see the land 
still. But when We send down water upon it, 
it stirs and grows. Surely, He Who revived it 
will revive the dead. He is Able to do all 
things.
40. Those who despise Our revelations are not 
hidden from Us. Is he who is hurled into the 
Fire better? Or he who arrives safely on the 
Day of Resurrection? Do as you please; He is 
Seeing of everything you do.
41. Those who reject the Reminder when it has 
come to them—it is an invincible Book.
42. Falsehood cannot approach it, from before 
it or behind it. It is a revelation from One 
Wise and Praiseworthy.
43. Nothing is said to you but was said to the 
Messengers before you: your Lord is Posses￾sor of Forgiveness, and Possessor of Painful 
Repayment.
44. Had We made it a Quran in a foreign lan￾guage, they would have said, “If only its 
verses were made clear.” Non-Arabic and an 
Arab? Say, “For those who believe, it is guid￾ance and healing. But as for those who do not 
believe: there is heaviness in their ears, and it 
is blindness for them. These are being called 
from a distant place.”
45. We gave Moses the Book, but disputes 
arose concerning it. Were it not for a prior 
decree from your Lord, judgment would have 
been pronounced between them. But they are 
in perplexing doubt concerning it.
46. Whoever acts righteously does so for him￾self; and whoever works evil does so against 
himself. Your Lord is not unjust to the serv￾ants.
47. To Him is referred the knowledge of the 
Hour. No fruit emerges from its sheath, and 
no female conceives or delivers, except with 
His knowledge. And on the Day when He
calls out to them, “Where are My associates?” 
They will say, “We admit to you, none of us 
is a witness.”
48. What they used to pray to before will for￾sake them, and they will realize that they have 
no escape.
49. The human being never tires of praying for
good things; but when adversity afflicts him, 
he despairs and loses hope.
50. And when We let him taste a mercy from 
Us, after the adversity that had afflicted him, 
he will say, “This is mine, and I do not think 
that the Hour is coming; and even if I am re￾turned to my Lord, I will have the very best 
183
42. CONSULTATION (ash-Shura)
with Him.” We will inform those who disbe￾lieve of what they did, and We will make 
them taste an awful punishment.
51. When We provide comfort for the human 
being, he withdraws and distances himself; 
but when adversity befalls him, he starts 
lengthy prayers.
52. Say, “Have you considered? If it is from Al￾lah and you reject it—who is further astray 
than he who is cutoff and alienated?”
53. We will show them Our proofs on the ho￾rizons, and in their very souls, until it be￾comes clear to them that it is the truth. Is it 
not sufficient that your Lord is witness over 
everything?
54. Surely they are in doubt about the encoun￾ter with their Lord. Surely He comprehends 
everything.
42. CONSULTATION
(ash-Shura)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Ha, Meem.
2. Ayn, Seen, Qaf.
3. Thus He inspires you, and those before 
you—Allah the Almighty, the Wise.
4. To him belongs everything in the heavens 
and everything on earth. He is the Sublime, 
the Magnificent.
5. The heavens above them almost burst apart, 
while the angels glorify the praises of their 
Lord, and ask forgiveness for those on earth. 
Allah is indeed the Forgiver, the Merciful.
6. As for those who take masters other than 
Him: Allah is in charge of them, and you are 
not responsible for them.
7. Thus We inspired you with an Arabic 
Quran, that you may warn the Central City 
and whoever is around it, and to warn of the 
Day of Assembly, of which there is no doubt; 
a group in the Garden, and a group in the 
Furnace.
8. Had Allah willed, He could have made them 
one community, but He admits into His 
mercy whomever He wills. As for the wrong￾doers, they will have no protector and no sav￾ior.
9. Or have they adopted protectors besides 
him? But Allah is the Protector, and He gives 
life to the dead, and He has power over all 
things.
10. Whatever matter you differ about, its judg￾ment rests with Allah. “Such is Allah, my 
Lord, in Whom I trust, and unto Him I re￾pent.”
11. Originator of the heavens and the earth. He 
made for you mates from among yourselves, 
and pairs of animals, by means of which He 
multiplies you. There is nothing like Him. He 
is the Hearing, the Seeing.
12. To Him belongs absolute control of the 
heavens and the earth. He spreads the boun￾ties to whomever He wills, or reduces it. He 
is aware of all things.
13. He prescribed for you the same religion He 
enjoined upon Noah, and what We inspired 
to you, and what We enjoined upon Abra￾ham, and Moses, and Jesus: “You shall up￾hold the religion, and be not divided therein.” 
As for the idolaters, what you call them to is 
outrageous to them. Allah chooses to Himself 
whom He wills, and He guides to Himself 
whoever repents.
14. They became divided only after knowledge 
came to them, out of resentment among 
themselves. Were it not for a predetermined 
decision from your Lord, judgment would 
have been pronounced between them. In￾deed, those who were made to inherit the 
Book after them are in grave doubt about it.
15. To this go on inviting, and be upright as 
you were commanded, and do not follow 
their inclinations, and say, “I believe in what￾ever Book Allah has sent down, and I was 
commanded to judge between you equitably. 
Allah is our Lord and your Lord. We have our 
deeds, and you have your deeds. Let there be 
no quarrel between us and you. Allah will 
184
42. CONSULTATION (ash-Shura)
bring us together, and to Him is the ultimate 
return.”
16. As for those who dispute about Allah after 
having answered His call, their argument is 
invalid with their Lord; and upon them falls 
wrath; and a grievous torment awaits them.
17. It is Allah who revealed the Book with the 
truth, and the Balance. And what will make 
you realize that perhaps the Hour is near?
18. Those who do not believe in it seek to has￾ten it; but those who believe are apprehensive 
of it, and they know it to be the truth. Abso￾lutely, those who question the Hour are in 
distant error.
19. Allah is kind towards His worshipers. He 
provides for whomever He wills. He is the 
Powerful, the Honorable.
20. Whoever desires the harvest of the Hereaf￾ter, We increase for him his harvest; and 
whoever desires the harvest of this world, We 
give him thereof, and he has no share of the 
Hereafter.
21. Or is it that they have partners who litigate 
for them religious laws never authorized by 
Allah? Were it not for the conclusive deci￾sion, it would have been settled between 
them. The wicked will have a painful punish￾ment.
22. You will see the unjust terrified of what 
they have earned, and it will befall them. As 
for those who believe and do good deeds, 
they will be in the Meadows of the Gardens; 
they will have whatever they please in the 
presence of their Lord; that is the supreme 
blessing.
23. That is the good news Allah gives to His 
servants who believe and do good deeds. Say, 
“I ask of you no wage for it, except affection 
among the near of kin.” Whoever does a good 
deed, We will increase its goodness for him. 
Allah is Forgiving and Appreciative.
24. Or do they say, “He forged a lie about Al￾lah.” If Allah so willed, He could have sealed 
your heart. But Allah obliterates the false, and 
confirm the true by His Words. He knows 
what is in the hearts.
25. It is He who accepts the repentance of His 
worshipers, and remits the sins, and knows 
what you do.
26. And He answers those who believe and do 
good deeds, and He increases them of His 
grace. But the disbelievers will suffer a terri￾ble punishment.
27. If Allah were to increase the provision to 
His servants, they would transgress on earth; 
but He sends down in precise measure what￾ever He wills. Surely, regarding His servants, 
He is Expert and Observant.
28. It is He who brings down the rain after they 
have despaired, and unfolds His mercy. He is 
the Guardian, the Praised.
29. And of His signs are the creation of the 
heavens and the earth, and the creatures He 
has spread throughout them; and He is Able 
to gather them at will.
30. Whatever misfortune befalls you, it is be￾cause of what your hands have earned; and 
yet He pardons much.
31. You are not the ones to interfere on earth; 
and besides Allah, you have no ally, and no 
helper.
32. And of His signs are the ships sailing the 
sea like flags.
33. If He willed, He could have stilled the 
winds, leaving them motionless on its sur￾face. Surely in that are signs for every disci￾plined, grateful person.
34. Or He could wreck them, because of what 
they have earned. And yet He pardons much.
35. Those who dispute Our signs know that 
there is no asylum for them.
36. Whatever thing you are given is only the 
provision of this life. But what Allah pos￾sesses is better and more lasting for those 
who believe and rely on their Lord.
37. And those who avoid major sins and inde￾cencies; and if they become angry, they for￾give.
38. And those who respond to their Lord, and 
pray regularly, and conduct their affairs by 
185
43. DECORATIONS (az-Zukhruf)
mutual consultation, and give of what We 
have provided them.
39. And those who, when wronged, defend 
themselves. 
40. The repayment of a bad action is one 
equivalent to it. But whoever pardons and 
makes reconciliation, his reward lies with Al￾lah. He does not love the unjust.
41. As for those who retaliate after being 
wronged, there is no blame on them. 
42. Blame lies on those who wrong people, and 
commit aggression in the land without right. 
These will have a painful punishment.
43. But whoever endures patiently and for￾gives—that is a sign of real resolve.
44. Whoever Allah leaves astray has no protec￾tor apart from Him. And you will see the 
transgressors, when they see the torment, 
saying, “Is there a way of going back?”
45. And you will see them exposed to it, cow￾ering from disgrace, looking with concealed 
eyes. Those who believed will say, “The losers 
are those who lost themselves and their fam￾ilies on the Day of Resurrection.” Indeed, the 
evildoers are in a lasting torment.
46. They will have no allies to support them 
against Allah. Whomever Allah leaves astray 
has no way out.
47. Respond to your Lord before there comes 
from Allah a Day that cannot be turned back. 
You will have no refuge on that Day, and no 
possibility of denial.
48. But if they turn away—We did not send 
you as a guardian over them. Your only duty 
is communication. Whenever We let man 
taste mercy from Us, he rejoices in it; but 
when misfortune befalls them, as a conse￾quence of what their hands have perpetrated, 
man turns blasphemous.
49. To Allah belongs the dominion of the 
heavens and the earth. He creates whatever 
He wills. He grants daughters to whomever 
He wills, and He grants sons to whomever He 
wills.
50. Or He combines them together, males and 
females; and He renders whomever He wills 
sterile. He is Knowledgeable and Capable.
51. It is not for any human that Allah should 
speak to him, except by inspiration, or from 
behind a veil, or by sending a messenger to 
reveal by His permission whatever He wills. 
He is All-High, All-Wise.
52. We thus inspired you spiritually, by Our 
command. You did not know what the Scrip￾ture is, nor what faith is, but We made it a 
light, with which We guide whomever We 
will of Our servants. You surely guide to a 
straight path.
53. The path of Allah, to whom belongs every￾thing in the heavens and everything on earth. 
Indeed, to Allah all matters revert.
43. DECORATIONS
(az-Zukhruf)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Ha, Meem.
2. By the Book that makes things clear.
3. We made it an Arabic Quran, so that you 
may understand.
4. And it is with Us, in the Source Book, sub￾lime and wise.
5. Shall We hold back the Reminder from you, 
since you are a transgressing people?
6. How many a prophet did We send to the 
ancients?
7. No messenger came to them, but they ridi￾culed him.
8. We destroyed people more powerful than 
they, and so the example of the ancients has 
passed away.
9. And if you asked them, “Who created the 
heavens and the earth?” They would say, 
“The Mighty, the Knower created them.”
186
43. DECORATIONS (az-Zukhruf)
10. He who made the earth a habitat for you, 
and traced pathways for you on it, that you 
may be guided.
11. He who sends down water from the sky in 
due proportion; and so We revive thereby a 
dead land. Thus you will be brought out.
12. He Who created all the pairs; and provided 
you with ships, and animals on which you 
ride.
13. That you may mount their backs, and re￾member the favor of your Lord as you sit 
firmly upon them, and say, “Glory be to Him 
Who placed these at our service; surely we 
could not have done it by ourselves.
14. And surely, to our Lord we will return.”
15. Yet they turn one of His servants into a part 
of Him. Man is clearly ungrateful.
16. Or has He chosen for Himself daughters 
from what He creates, and favored you with 
sons?
17. Yet when one of them is given news of what 
he attributes to the Most Gracious, his face 
darkens, and he suppresses grief.
18. “Someone brought up to be beautiful, and 
unable to help in a fight?”
19. And they appoint the angels, who are serv￾ants to the Most Gracious, as females. Have 
they witnessed their creation? Their claim 
will be recorded, and they will be questioned.
20. And they say, “Had the Most Gracious 
willed, we would not have worshiped them.” 
But they have no knowledge of that; they are 
merely guessing.
21. Or have We given them a book prior to this 
one, to which they adhere?
22. But they say, “We found our parents on a 
course, and we are guided in their footsteps.”
23. Likewise, We sent no warner before you to 
any town, but the wealthy among them said, 
“We found our parents on a course, and we 
are following in their footsteps.”
24. He would say, “Even if I bring you better 
guidance than what you found your parents 
following?” They would say, “We reject what 
you are sent with.”
25. So We wreaked vengeance upon them. Be￾hold, then, what was the fate of those who 
deny.
26. When Abraham said to his father and his 
people, “I am innocent of what you worship.
27. Except for He who created me, for He will 
guide me.”
28. And he made it an enduring word in his 
progeny, so that they may return.
29. I gave these and their forefathers some en￾joyment, until the truth and a manifest mes￾senger came to them.
30. But when the truth came to them, they 
said, “This is sorcery, and we refuse to believe 
in it.”
31. They also said, “If only this Quran was sent 
down to a man of importance from the two 
cities.”
32. Is it they who allocate the mercy of your 
Lord? It is We who have allocated their live￾lihood in this life, and We elevated some of 
them in rank above others, that some of them 
would take others in service. But your Lord’s 
mercy is better than what they amass.
33. Were it not that humanity would become a 
single community, We would have provided 
those who disbelieve in the Most Gracious 
with roofs of silver to their houses, and stair￾ways by which they ascend.
34. And doors to their houses, and furnishings 
on which they recline.
35. And decorations. Yet all that is nothing but 
the stuff of this life. Yet the Hereafter, with 
your Lord, is for the righteous.
36. Whoever shuns the remembrance of the 
Most Gracious, We assign for him a devil, to 
be his companion.
37. They hinder them from the path, though 
they think they are guided.
187
43. DECORATIONS (az-Zukhruf)
38. Until, when He comes to Us, he will say, “If 
only there were between me and you the dis￾tance of the two Easts.” What an evil com￾panion!
39. It will not benefit you on that Day, since 
you did wrong. You are partners in the suf￾fering.
40. Can you make the deaf hear, or guide the 
blind, and him who is in evident error?
41. Even if We take you away, We will wreak 
vengeance upon them.
42. Or show you what We have promised 
them; for We have absolute power over them.
43. So adhere to what is revealed to you. You 
are upon a straight path.
44. It is a message for you, and for your people; 
and you will be questioned.
45. Ask those of Our messengers We sent be￾fore you: “Did We appoint gods besides the 
Most Gracious to be worshiped?”
46. We sent Moses with Our revelations to 
Pharaoh and his dignitaries. He said, “I am 
the Messenger of the Lord of the Worlds.”
47. But when he showed them Our signs, they 
started laughing at them.
48. Each sign We showed them was more mar￾velous than its counterpart. And We afflicted 
them with the plagues, so that they may re￾pent.
49. They said, “O sorcerer, pray to your Lord 
for us, according to His pledge to you, and 
then we will be guided.”
50. But when We lifted the torment from 
them, they immediately broke their promise.
51. Pharaoh proclaimed among his people, 
saying, “O my people, do I not own the King￾dom of Egypt, and these rivers flow beneath 
me? Do you not see?
52. Am I not better than this miserable wretch, 
who can barely express himself?
53. Why are bracelets of gold not dropped on 
him, or they angels came with him in proces￾sion?”
54. Thus he fooled his people, and they obeyed 
him. They were wicked people.
55. And when they provoked Our wrath, We 
took retribution from them, and We 
drowned them all.
56. Thus We made them a precedent and an 
example for the others.
57. And when the son of Mary was cited as an 
example, your people opposed.
58. They said, “Are our gods better, or he?” 
They cited him only for argument. In fact, 
they are a quarrelsome people.
59. He was just a servant whom We blessed, 
and We made him an example for the Chil￾dren of Israel.
60. Had We willed, We would have made of 
you angels to be successors on earth.
61. He is a portent of the Hour, so have no 
doubt about it, and follow Me. This is a 
straight way.
62. And let not Satan divert you. He is an open 
enemy to you.
63. When Jesus came with the clarifications, he 
said, “I have come to you with wisdom, and 
to clarify for you some of what you differ 
about. So fear Allah, and obey me.
64. Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so wor￾ship Him—this is a straight path.”
65. But the factions differed among them￾selves. So woe to the wrongdoers from the 
suffering of a painful Day.
66. Are they only waiting for the Hour to come 
upon them suddenly, while they are una￾ware?
67. On that Day, friends will be enemies of one 
another, except for the righteous.
68. O My servants, you have nothing to fear on 
that Day, nor will you grieve.
69. Those who believed in Our revelations, 
and were submissive.
70. Enter the Garden, you and your spouses, 
Joyfully.
188
44. SMOKE (ad-Dukhan)
71. They will be served around with trays of 
gold, and cups. Therein is whatever the souls 
desire and delights the eyes. Therein you will 
stay forever.
72. Such is the Garden you are made to inherit, 
because of what you used to do.
73. Therein you will have abundant fruit, from 
which you eat.
74. As for the sinners, they will be in the tor￾ment of Hell forever.
75. It will never be eased for them. In it, they 
will be devastated.
76. We did them no injustice, but it was they 
who were the unjust.
77. And they will cry, “O Malek, let your Lord 
finish us off.” He will say, “You are staying.”
78. We have given you the truth, but most of 
you hate the truth.
79. Have they contrived some scheme? We too 
are contriving.
80. Or do they think that We cannot hear their 
secrets and their conspiracies? Yes indeed, 
Our messengers are by them, writing down.
81. Say, “If the Most Gracious had a son, I 
would be the first to worship.”
82. Glorified be the Lord of the heavens and 
the earth, the Lord of the Throne, beyond 
what they describe.
83. So leave them to blunder and play, until 
they encounter their Day which they are 
promised.
84. It is He who is Allah in heaven, and Allah 
on earth. He is the Wise, the Knower.
85. And blessed is He Who has sovereignty 
over the heavens and the earth and what is 
between them. He alone has knowledge of the 
Hour, and to Him you will be returned.
86. Those they invoke besides Him are incapa￾ble of intercession; only those who testify to 
the truth and have knowledge.
87. And if you asked them, “Who created 
them?”, they would say, “Allah.” Why then 
do they deviate?
88. As for his statement: “My Lord, these are a 
people who do not believe.”
89. Pardon them, and say, “Peace.” They will 
come to know.
44. SMOKE
(ad-Dukhan)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Ha, Meem.
2. By the Enlightening Scripture.
3. We have revealed it on a Blessed Night—
We have warned.
4. In it is distinguished every wise command.
5. A decree from Us. We have been sending 
messages.
6. As mercy from your Lord. He is the Hearer, 
the Knower.
7. Lord of the heavens and the earth and what 
is between them, if you know for sure.
8. There is no god but He. He gives life and 
causes death—your Lord and Lord of your 
ancestors of old.
9. Yet they play around in doubt.
10. So watch out for the Day when the sky pro￾duces a visible smoke.
11. Enveloping mankind; this is a painful pun￾ishment.
12. “Our Lord, lift the torment from us, we are 
believers.”
13. But how can they be reminded? An enlight￾ening messenger has already come to them.
14. But they turned away from him, and said, 
“Educated, but crazy!”
15. We will ease the punishment a little, but 
you will revert.
16. The Day when We launch the Great As￾sault—We will avenge.
17. Before them We tested the people of Phar￾aoh; a noble messenger came to them.
189
45. KNEELING (al-Jathiyah)
18. Saying, “Hand over Allah’s servants to me. 
I am an honest messenger to you.”
19. And, “Do not exalt yourselves above Allah. 
I come to you with clear authority.
20. I have taken refuge in my Lord and your 
Lord, lest you stone me.
21. But if you do not believe in me, keep away 
from me.”
22. He appealed to his Lord: “These are a sinful 
people.”
23. “Set out with My servants by night—you 
will be followed.
24. And cross the sea quickly; they are an army 
to be drowned.”
25. How many gardens and fountains did they 
leave behind?
26. And plantations, and splendid buildings.
27. And comforts they used to enjoy.
28. So it was; and We passed it on to another 
people. 
29. Neither heaven nor earth wept over them, 
nor were they reprieved.
30. And We delivered the Children of Israel 
from the humiliating persecution.
31. From Pharaoh. He was a transgressing ty￾rant. 
32. And We chose them knowingly over all 
other people.
33. And We gave them many signs, in which 
was an obvious test.
34. These people say.
35. “There is nothing but our first death, and 
we will not be resurrected.
36. Bring back our ancestors, if you are truth￾ful.”
37. Are they better, or the people of Tubba and 
those before them? We annihilated them. 
They were evildoers.
38. We did not create the heavens and the 
earth and what is between them to play.
39. We created them only for a specific pur￾pose, but most of them do not know.
40. The Day of Sorting Out is the appointed 
time for them all.
41. The Day when no friend will avail a friend 
in any way, and they will not be helped.
42. Except for him upon whom Allah has 
mercy. He is the Mighty, the Merciful.
43. The Tree of Bitterness.
44. The food of the sinner.
45. Like molten lead; boiling inside the bellies.
46. Like the boiling of seething water.
47. Seize him and drag him into the midst of 
Hell!
48. Then pour over his head the suffering of 
the Inferno!
49. Taste! You who were powerful and noble.
50. This is what you used to doubt.
51. As for the righteous, they will be in a secure 
place.
52. Amidst gardens and springs.
53. Dressed in silk and brocade, facing one an￾other.
54. So it is, and We will wed them to lovely 
companions.
55. They will call therein for every kind of fruit, 
in peace and security.
56. Therein they will not taste death, beyond 
the first death; and He will protect them from 
the torment of Hell.
57. A favor from your Lord. That is the su￾preme salvation.
58. We made it easy in your language, so that 
they may remember.
59. So wait and watch. They too are waiting 
and watching.
45. KNEELING
(al-Jathiyah)
In the name of Allah, 
190
45. KNEELING (al-Jathiyah)
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Ha, Meem.
2. The revelation of the Book is from Allah, 
the Exalted in Might, the Wise.
3. In the heavens and the earth are proofs for 
the believers.
4. And in your own creation, and in the crea￾tures He scattered, are signs for people of 
firm faith.
5. And in the alternation of night and day, and 
in the sustenance Allah sends down from the 
sky, with which He revives the earth after its 
death, and in the circulation of the winds, are 
marvels for people who reason.
6. These are Allah’s Verses which We recite to 
you in truth. In which message, after Allah 
and His revelations, will they believe?
7. Woe to every sinful liar.
8. Who hears Allah's revelations being recited 
to him, yet he persists arrogantly, as though 
he did not hear them. Announce to him a 
painful punishment.
9. And when he learns something of Our rev￾elations, he takes them in mockery. For such 
there is a shameful punishment.
10. Beyond them lies Hell. What they have 
earned will not benefit them at all, nor will 
those they adopted as lords instead of Allah. 
They will have a terrible punishment.
11. This is guidance. Those who blaspheme 
their Lord’s revelations will have a punish￾ment of agonizing pain.
12. It is Allah who placed the sea at your ser￾vice, so that ships may run through it by His 
command, and that you may seek of His 
bounty, and that you may give thanks. 
13. And He placed at your service whatever is 
in the heavens and whatever is on earth—all 
is from Him. In that are signs for a people 
who think.
14. Tell those who believe to forgive those who 
do not hope for the Days of Allah. He will 
fully recompense people for whatever they 
have earned.
15. Whoever does a good deed, it is for his soul; 
and whoever commits evil, it is against it; 
then to your Lord you will be returned.
16. We gave the Children of Israel the Book, 
and wisdom, and prophecy; and We pro￾vided them with the good things; and We 
gave them advantage over all other people.
17. And We gave them precise rulings. They 
fell into dispute only after knowledge came to 
them, out of mutual rivalry. Your Lord will 
judge between them on the Day of Resurrec￾tion regarding the things they differed about.
18. Then We set you upon a pathway of faith, 
so follow it, and do not follow the inclina￾tions of those who do not know.
19. They will not help you against Allah in any 
way. The wrongdoers are allies of one an￾other, while Allah is the Protector of the 
righteous.
20. This is an illumination for mankind, and 
guidance, and mercy for people who believe 
with certainty.
21. Do those who perpetrate the evil deeds as￾sume that We will regard them as equal to 
those who believe and do righteous deeds, 
whether in their life or their death? Evil is 
their judgment!
22. Allah created the heavens and the earth 
with justice, so that every soul will be repaid 
for what it has earned. And they will not be 
wronged.
23. Have you considered him who has taken 
his desire for his god? Allah has knowingly 
led him astray, and has sealed his hearing and 
his heart, and has placed a veil over his vision. 
Who will guide him after Allah? Will you not 
reflect?
24. And they say, “There is nothing but this 
our present life; we die and we live, and noth￾ing destroys us except time.” But they have no 
knowledge of that; they are only guessing.
191
46. THE DUNES (al-Ahqaf)
25. When Our clarifying Verses are recited to 
them, their only argument is to say, “Bring 
back our ancestors, if you are truthful.”
26. Say, “Allah gives you life, then He makes 
you die; then He gathers you for the Day of 
Resurrection, about which there is no doubt. 
But most people do not know.”
27. To Allah belongs the kingship of the heav￾ens and the earth. On the Day when the Hour 
takes place, on that Day the falsifiers will lose.
28. You will see every community on its knees; 
every community will be called to its Book: 
“Today you are being repaid for what you 
used to do.
29. This Book of Ours speaks about you in 
truth. We have been transcribing what you 
have been doing.”
30. As for those who believed and did right￾eous deeds, their Lord will admit them into 
His mercy. That is the clear triumph.
31. But as for those who disbelieved: “Were My 
revelations not recited to you? But you 
turned arrogant, and were guilty people.”
32. And when it was said, “The promise of Al￾lah is true, and of the Hour there is no doubt,” 
you said, “We do not know what the Hour is; 
we think it is only speculation; we are not 
convinced.”
33. The evils of what they did will become evi￾dent to them, and the very thing they ridi￾culed will haunt them.
34. And it will be said, “Today We forget you, 
as you forgot the encounter of this Day of 
yours. Your abode is the Fire, and there are 
no saviors for you.
35. That is because you took Allah’s revela￾tions for a joke, and the worldly life lured 
you.” So today they will not be brought out of 
it, and they will not be allowed to repent.
36. Praise belongs to Allah; Lord of the heav￾ens, Lord of the earth, Lord of humanity.
37. To Him belongs all supremacy in the heav￾ens and the earth. He is the Majestic, the 
Wise.
46. THE DUNES
(al-Ahqaf)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Ha, Meem.
2. The sending down of the Scripture is from 
Allah, the Honorable, the Wise.
3. We did not create the heavens and the earth 
and what lies between them except with rea￾son, and for a finite period. But the blas￾phemers continue to ignore the warnings 
they receive.
4. Say, “Have you considered those you wor￾ship instead of Allah? Show me which por￾tion of the earth they have created. Or do they 
own a share of the heavens? Bring me a scrip￾ture prior to this one, or some trace of 
knowledge, if you are truthful.”
5. Who is more wrong than him who invokes, 
besides Allah, those who will not answer him 
until the Day of Resurrection, and are heed￾less of their prayers?
6. And when humanity is gathered, they will 
be enemies to them, and will renounce their 
worship of them.
7. When Our revelations are recited to them, 
plain and clear, those who disbelieve say of 
the truth when it has come to them, “This is 
obviously magic.”
8. Or do they say, “He invented it himself”? 
Say, “If I invented it myself, there is nothing 
you can do to protect me from Allah. He 
knows well what you are engaged in. He is 
sufficient witness between me and you. He is 
the Forgiver, the Merciful.”
9. Say, “I am not different from the other mes￾sengers; and I do not know what will be done 
with me, or with you. I only follow what is in￾spired in me, and I am only a clear warner.”
10. Say, “Have you considered? What if it is 
from Allah and you disbelieve in it? A witness 
from the Children of Israel testified to its like, 
192
46. THE DUNES (al-Ahqaf)
and has believed, while you turned arrogant. 
Allah does not guide the unjust people.”
11. Those who disbelieve say to those who be￾lieve, “If it were anything good, they would 
not have preceded us to it.” And since they 
were not guided by it, they will say, “This is 
an ancient lie.”
12. And before it was the Book of Moses, a 
model and a mercy. And this is a confirming 
Book, in the Arabic language, to warn those 
who do wrong—and good news for the doers 
of good.
13. Those who say, “Our Lord is Allah,” then 
lead a righteous life—they have nothing to 
fear, nor shall they grieve.
14. These are the inhabitants of Paradise, 
where they will dwell forever—a reward for 
what they used to do.
15. We have enjoined upon man kindness to 
his parents. His mother carried him with dif￾ficulty, and delivered him with difficulty. His 
bearing and weaning takes thirty months. 
Until, when he has attained his maturity, and 
has reached forty years, he says, “Lord, enable 
me to appreciate the blessings You have be￾stowed upon me and upon my parents, and 
to act with righteousness, pleasing You. And 
improve my children for me. I have sincerely 
repented to You, and I am of those who have 
surrendered.”
16. Those are they from whom We accept the 
best of their deeds, and We overlook their 
misdeeds, among the dwellers of Paradise—
the promise of truth which they are prom￾ised.
17. As for him who says to his parents, 
“Enough of you! Are you promising me that 
I will be raised up, when generations have 
passed away before me?” While they cry for 
Allah’s help, “Woe to you! Believe! The 
promise of Allah is true!” But he says, “These 
are nothing but tales of the ancients.”
18. Those are they upon whom the sentence is 
justified, among the communities that have 
passed away before them, of jinn and hu￾mans. They are truly losers.
19. There are degrees for everyone, according 
to what they have done, and He will repay 
them for their works in full, and they will not 
be wronged.
20. On the Day when the faithless will be pa￾raded before the Fire: “You have squandered 
your good in your worldly life, and you took 
pleasure in them. So today you are being re￾paid with the torment of shame, because of 
your unjust arrogance on earth, and because 
you used to sin.”
21. And mention the brother of Aad, as he 
warned his people at the dunes. Warnings 
have passed away before him, and after him: 
“Worship none but Allah; I fear for you the 
punishment of a tremendous Day.”
22. They said, “Did you come to us to divert us 
from our gods? Then bring us what you 
threaten us with, if you are being truthful.”
23. He said, “The knowledge is only with Al￾lah, and I inform you of what I was sent with; 
but I see you are an ignorant people.”
24. Then, when they saw a cloud approaching 
their valley, they said, “This is a cloud that 
will bring us rain.” “In fact, it is what you 
were impatient for: a wind in which is griev￾ous suffering.”
25. It will destroy everything by the command 
of its Lord. And when the morning came 
upon them, there was nothing to be seen ex￾cept their dwellings. Thus We requite the 
guilty people.
26. We had empowered them in the same way 
as We empowered you; and We gave them 
the hearing, and the sight, and the minds. But 
neither their hearing, nor their sight, nor 
their minds availed them in any way. That is 
because they disregarded the revelations of 
Allah; and so they became surrounded by 
what they used to ridicule.
27. We have destroyed many townships 
around you, and diversified the signs, so that 
they may return.
28. Why then did the idols, whom they wor￾shiped as means of nearness to Allah, not 
help them? In fact, they abandoned them. It 
193
47. MUHAMMAD (Muhammad)
was their lie, a fabrication of their own mak￾ing.
29. Recall when We dispatched towards you a 
number of jinn, to listen to the Quran. When 
they came in its presence, they said, “Pay at￾tention!” Then, when it was concluded, they 
rushed to their people, warning them.
30. They said, “O our people, we have heard a 
Scripture, sent down after Moses, confirming 
what came before it. It guides to the truth, 
and to a straight path.
31. O our people! Answer the caller to Allah, 
and believe in Him; and He will forgive you 
your sins, and will save you from a painful 
punishment.”
32. He who does not answer the caller to Allah 
will not escape on earth, and has no protec￾tors besides Him. Those are in obvious error.
33. Do they not realize that Allah, who created 
the heavens and the earth, and was never 
tired by creating them, is Able to revive the 
dead? Yes indeed; He is Capable of every￾thing.
34. On the Day when those who disbelieved 
are presented to the Fire: “Is this not real?” 
They will say, “Yes, indeed, by our Lord.” He 
will say, “Then taste the suffering for having 
disbelieved.”
35. So be patient, as the messengers with re￾solve were patient, and do not be hasty re￾garding them. On the Day when they witness 
what they are promised, it will seem as if they 
had lasted only for an hour of a day. A proc￾lamation: Will any be destroyed except the 
sinful people?
47. MUHAMMAD
(Muhammad)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Those who disbelieve and repel from the 
path of Allah—He nullifies their works.
2. While those who believe, and work right￾eousness, and believe in what was sent down 
to Muhammad—and it is the truth from their 
Lord—He remits their sins, and relieves their 
concerns.
3. That is because those who disbelieve follow 
falsehoods, while those who believe follow 
the truth from their Lord. Allah thus cites for 
the people their examples.
4. When you encounter those who disbelieve, 
strike at their necks. Then, when you have 
routed them, bind them firmly. Then, either 
release them by grace, or by ransom, until 
war lays down its burdens. Had Allah willed, 
He could have defeated them Himself, but He 
thus tests some of you by means of others. As 
for those who are killed in the way of Allah, 
He will not let their deeds go to waste.
5. He will guide them, and will improve their 
state of mind.
6. And will admit them into Paradise, which 
He has identified for them.
7. O you who believe! If you support Allah, He 
will support you, and will strengthen your 
foothold.
8. But as for those who disbelieve, for them is 
perdition, and He will waste their deeds.
9. That is because they hated what Allah re￾vealed, so He nullified their deeds.
10. Have they not journeyed through the earth 
and seen the consequences for those before 
them? Allah poured destruction upon them, 
and for the unbelievers is something compa￾rable.
11. That is because Allah is the Master of those 
who believe, while the disbelievers have no 
master.
12. Allah will admit those who believe and do 
good deeds into gardens beneath which riv￾ers flow. As for those who disbelieve, they en￾joy themselves, and eat as cattle eat, and the 
Fire will be their dwelling.
13. How many a town was more powerful than 
your town which evicted you? We destroyed 
them, and there was no helper for them.
14. Is he who stands upon evidence from his 
Lord, like someone whose evil deed is made 
194
47. MUHAMMAD (Muhammad)
to appear good to him? And they follow their 
own desires?
15. The likeness of the Garden promised to the 
righteous: in it are rivers of pure water, and 
rivers of milk forever fresh, and rivers of wine 
delightful to the drinkers, and rivers of 
strained honey. And therein they will have of 
every fruit, and forgiveness from their Lord. 
Like one abiding in the Fire forever, and are 
given to drink boiling water, that cuts-up 
their bowels?
16. Among them are those who listen to you, 
but when they leave your presence, they say 
to those given knowledge, “What did he say 
just now?” Those are they whose hearts Allah 
has sealed, and they follow their own desires.
17. As for those who are guided, He increases 
them in guidance, and He has granted them 
their righteousness.
18. Are they just waiting until the Hour comes 
to them suddenly? Its tokens have already 
come. But how will they be reminded when it 
has come to them?
19. Know that there is no god but Allah, and 
ask forgiveness for your sin, and for the be￾lieving men and believing women. Allah 
knows your movements, and your resting￾place.
20. Those who believe say, “If only a chapter is 
sent down.” Yet when a decisive chapter is 
sent down, and fighting is mentioned in it, 
you see those in whose hearts is sickness 
looking at you with the look of someone 
fainting at death. So woe to them!
21. Obedience and upright speech. Then, 
when the matter is settled, being true to Allah 
would have been better for them.
22. If you turn away, you are likely to make 
mischief on earth, and sever your family ties.
23. Those are they whom Allah has cursed. He 
made them deaf, and blinded their sight.
24. Will they not ponder the Quran? Or are 
there locks upon their hearts?
25. Those who reverted after the guidance be￾came clear to them—Satan has enticed them, 
and has given them latitude. 
26. That is because they said to those who 
hated what Allah has revealed, “We will obey 
you in certain matters.” But Allah knows 
their secret thoughts.
27. How about when the angels take them at 
death, beating their faces and their backs?
28. That is because they pursued what dis￾pleases Allah, and they disliked His approval, 
so He nullified their works.
29. Do those in whose hearts is sickness think 
that Allah will not expose their malice?
30. Had We willed, We could have shown 
them to you, and you would have recognized 
them by their marks. Yet you will recognize 
them by their tone of speech. And Allah 
knows your actions.
31. We will certainly test you, until We know 
those among you who strive, and those who 
are steadfast, and We will test your reactions.
32. Those who disbelieve, and hinder from the 
path of Allah, and oppose the Messenger af￾ter guidance has become clear to them—they 
will not hurt Allah in the least, but He will 
nullify their deeds.
33. O you who believe! Obey Allah, and obey 
the Messenger, and do not let your deeds go 
to waste.
34. Those who disbelieve, and hinder from Al￾lah’s path, and then die as disbelievers—Al￾lah will not forgive them.
35. So do not waver and call for peace while 
you have the upper hand. Allah is with you, 
and He will not waste your efforts.
36. The life of this world is nothing but play 
and pastime. But if you have faith and lead a 
righteous life, He will grant you your re￾wards, and He will not ask you for your pos￾sessions.
37. Were He to ask you for it, and press you, 
you would become tightfisted, and He would 
expose your unwillingness.
195
48. VICTORY (al-Fath)
38. Here you are, being called to spend in the 
cause of Allah. Among you are those who 
withhold; but whoever withholds is with￾holding against his own soul. Allah is the 
Rich, while you are the needy. And if you 
turn away, He will replace you with another 
people, and they will not be like you.
48. VICTORY
(al-Fath)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. We have granted you a conspicuous victory.
2. That Allah may forgive you your sin, past 
and to come, and complete His favors upon 
you, and guide you in a straight path.
3. And help you with an unwavering support.
4. It is He who sent down tranquility into the 
hearts of the believers, to add faith to their 
faith. To Allah belong the forces of the heav￾ens and the earth. Allah is Knowing and 
Wise.
5. He will admit the believers, male and fe￾male, into Gardens beneath which rivers 
flow, to abide therein forever, and He will re￾mit their sins. That, with Allah, is a great tri￾umph. 
6. And He will punish the hypocrites, male 
and female, and the idolaters, male and fe￾male, those who harbor evil thoughts about 
Allah. They are surrounded by evil; and Allah 
is angry with them, and has cursed them, and 
has prepared for them Hell—a miserable des￾tination.
7. To Allah belong the troops of the heavens 
and the earth. Allah is Mighty and Wise.
8. We sent you as a witness, and a bearer of 
good news, and a warner.
9. That you may believe in Allah and His Mes￾senger, and support Him, and honor Him, 
and praise Him morning and evening.
10. Those who pledge allegiance to you are 
pledging allegiance to Allah. The hand of Al￾lah is over their hands. Whoever breaks his 
pledge breaks it to his own loss. And whoever 
fulfills his covenant with Allah, He will grant 
him a great reward.
11. The Desert-Arabs who remained behind 
will say to you, “Our belongings and our fam￾ilies have preoccupied us, so ask forgiveness 
for us.” They say with their tongues what is 
not in their hearts. Say, “Who can avail you 
anything against Allah, if He desires loss for 
you, or desires gain for you?” In fact, Allah is 
Informed of what you do.
12. But you thought that the Messenger and 
the believers will never return to their fami￾lies, and this seemed fine to your hearts; and 
you harbored evil thoughts, and were uncivi￾lized people.
13. He who does not believe in Allah and His 
Messenger—We have prepared for the disbe￾lievers a Blazing Fire.
14. To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heav￾ens and the earth. He forgives whomever He 
wills, and He punishes whomever He wills. 
Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
15. Those who lagged behind will say when 
you depart to collect the gains, “Let us follow 
you.” They want to change the Word of Al￾lah. Say, “You will not follow us; Allah has 
said so before.” Then they will say, “But you 
are jealous of us.” In fact, they understand 
only a little.
16. Say to the Desert-Arabs who lagged be￾hind, “You will be called against a people of 
great might; you will fight them, unless they 
submit. If you obey, Allah will give you a fine 
reward. But if you turn away, as you turned 
away before, He will punish you with a pain￾ful punishment.”
17. There is no blame on the blind, nor any 
blame on the lame, nor any blame on the sick. 
Whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger—
He will admit him into gardens beneath 
which rivers flow; but whoever turns away—
He will punish him with a painful punish￾ment.
18. Allah was pleased with the believers, when 
they pledged allegiance to you under the tree. 
196
49. THE CHAMBERS (al-Hujurat)
He knew what was in their hearts, and sent 
down serenity upon them, and rewarded 
them with an imminent conquest.
19. And abundant gains for them to capture. 
Allah is Mighty and Wise.
20. Allah has promised you abundant gains, 
which you will capture. He has expedited this 
for you, and has restrained people’s hands 
from you; that it may be a sign to the believ￾ers, and that He may guide you on a straight 
path.
21. And other things, of which you were inca￾pable, but Allah has encompassed them. Al￾lah is Capable of everything.
22. If those who disbelieve had fought you, 
they would have turned back and fled, then 
found neither protector nor helper.
23. It is Allah’s pattern, ongoing since the past. 
You will never find any change in Allah’s pat￾tern.
24. It is He who withheld their hands from 
you, and your hands from them, in the valley 
of Mecca, after giving you advantage over 
them. Allah is Observer of what you do.
25. It is they who disbelieved, and barred you 
from the Sacred Mosque, and prevented the 
offering from reaching its destination. Were 
it not for faithful men and faithful women, 
whom you did not know, you were about to 
hurt them, and became guilty of an uninten￾tional crime. Thus Allah admits into His 
mercy whomever He wills. Had they dis￾persed, We would have punished those who 
disbelieved among them with a painful pen￾alty.
26. Those who disbelieved filled their hearts 
with rage—the rage of the days of ignorance. 
But Allah sent His serenity down upon His 
Messenger, and upon the believers, and im￾posed on them the words of righteousness—
of which they were most worthy and deserv￾ing. Allah is aware of everything.
27. Allah has fulfilled His Messenger’s vision 
in truth: “You will enter the Sacred Mosque, 
Allah willing, in security, heads shaven, or
hair cut short, not fearing. He knew what you 
did not know, and has granted besides that an 
imminent victory.”
28. It is He who sent His Messenger with the 
guidance and the religion of truth, to make it 
prevail over all religions. Allah suffices as 
Witness.
29. Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. 
Those with him are stern against the disbe￾lievers, yet compassionate amongst them￾selves. You see them kneeling, prostrating, 
seeking blessings from Allah and approval. 
Their marks are on their faces from the ef￾fects of prostration. Such is their description 
in the Torah, and their description in the 
Gospel: like a plant that sprouts, becomes 
strong, grows thick, and rests on its stem, im￾pressing the farmers. Through them He en￾rages the disbelievers. Allah has promised 
those among them who believe and do good 
deeds forgiveness and a great reward.
49. THE CHAMBERS
(al-Hujurat)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. O you who believe! Do not place your opin￾ions above that of Allah and His Messenger, 
and fear Allah. Allah is Hearing and Know￾ing.
2. O you who believe! Do not raise your voices 
above the voice of the Prophet, and do not 
speak loudly to him, as you speak loudly to 
one another, lest your works be in vain with￾out you realizing.
3. Those who lower their voices before Allah’s 
Messenger—those are they whose hearts Al￾lah has tested for piety. They will have for￾giveness and a great reward.
4. Those who call you from behind the cham￾bers—most of them do not understand.
5. Had they remained patient until you came 
out to them, it would have been better for 
them. But Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
197
50. QAF (Qaf)
6. O you who believe! If a troublemaker brings 
you any news, investigate, lest you harm peo￾ple out of ignorance, and you become regret￾ful for what you have done.
7. And know that among you is the Messenger 
of Allah. Had he obeyed you in many things, 
you would have suffered hardship. But Allah 
has given you the love of faith, and adorned 
it in your hearts, and made disbelief, mis￾chief, and rebellion hateful to you. These are 
the rightly guided.
8. A Grace and Favor from Allah. Allah is 
Knowing and Wise.
9. If two groups of believers fight each other, 
reconcile between them. But if one group ag￾gresses against the other, fight the aggressing 
group until it complies with Allah’s com￾mand. Once it has complied, reconcile be￾tween them with justice, and be equitable. Al￾lah loves the equitable.
10. The believers are brothers, so reconcile be￾tween your brothers, and remain conscious 
of Allah, so that you may receive mercy.
11. O you who believe! No people shall ridicule 
other people, for they may be better than 
they. Nor shall any women ridicule other 
women, for they may be better than they. Nor 
shall you slander one another, nor shall you 
insult one another with names. Evil is the re￾turn to wickedness after having attained 
faith. Whoever does not repent—these are 
the wrongdoers.
12. O you who believe! Avoid most suspi￾cion—some suspicion is sinful. And do not 
spy on one another, nor backbite one an￾other. Would any of you like to eat the flesh 
of his dead brother? You would detest it. So 
remain mindful of Allah. Allah is Most Re￾lenting, Most Merciful.
13. O people! We created you from a male and 
a female, and made you races and tribes, that 
you may know one another. The best among 
you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous. 
Allah is All-Knowing, Well-Experienced.
14. The Desert-Arabs say, “We have believed.” 
Say, “You have not believed; but say, ‘We 
have submitted,’ for faith has not yet entered 
into your hearts. But if you obey Allah and 
His Messenger, He will not diminish any of 
your deeds. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.”
15. The believers are those who believe in Al￾lah and His Messenger, and then have not 
doubted, and strive for Allah’s cause with 
their wealth and their persons. These are the 
sincere.
16. Say, “Are you going to teach Allah about 
your religion, when Allah knows everything 
in the heavens and the earth, and Allah is 
aware of all things?”
17. They regarded it a favor to you that they 
have submitted. Say, “Do not consider your 
submission a favor to me; it is Allah who has 
done you a favor by guiding you to the faith, 
if you are sincere.”
18. Allah knows the secrets of the heavens and 
the earth, and Allah is seeing of everything 
you do.
50. QAF
(Qaf)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Qaf. By the Glorious Quran.
2. They marveled that a warner has come to 
them from among them. The disbelievers say, 
“This is something strange.
3. When we have died and become dust? This 
is a farfetched return.”
4. We know what the earth consumes of them, 
and with Us is a comprehensive book.
5. But they denied the truth when it has come 
to them, so they are in a confused state.
6. Have they not observed the sky above them, 
how We constructed it, and decorated it, and 
it has no cracks?
7. And the earth, how We spread it out, and 
set on it mountains, and grew in it all kinds 
of delightful pairs?
198
50. QAF (Qaf)
8. A lesson and a reminder for every penitent 
worshiper.
9. And We brought down from the sky blessed 
water, and produced with it gardens and 
grain to harvest.
10. And the soaring palm trees, with clustered 
dates.
11. As sustenance for the servants. And We re￾vive thereby a dead town. Likewise is the res￾urrection.
12. Before them the people of Noah denied the 
truth, and so did the dwellers of Russ, and 
Thamood.
13. And Aad, and Pharaoh, and the brethren of 
Lot.
14. And the Dwellers of the Woods, and the 
people of Tubba. They all rejected the mes￾sengers, so My threat came true.
15. Were We fatigued by the first creation? But 
they are in doubt of a new creation.
16. We created the human being, and We 
know what his soul whispers to him. We are 
nearer to him than his jugular vein.
17. As the two receivers receive, seated to the 
right and to the left.
18. Not a word does he utter, but there is a 
watcher by him, ready.
19. The daze of death has come in truth: “This 
is what you tried to evade.”
20. And the Trumpet is blown: “This is the 
Promised Day.”
21. And every soul will come forward, accom￾panied by a driver and a witness.
22. “You were in neglect of this, so We lifted 
your screen from you, and your vision today 
is keen.”
23. And His escort will say, “This is what I have 
ready with me.”
24. “Throw into Hell every stubborn disbe￾liever.
25. Preventer of good, aggressor, doubter.
26. Who fabricated another god with Allah; 
toss him into the intense agony.”
27. His escort will say, “Our Lord, I did not 
make him rebel, but he was far astray.”
28. He will say, “Do not feud in My presence—
I had warned you in advance.
29. The decree from Me will not be changed, 
and I am not unjust to the servants.”
30. On the Day when We will say to Hell, “Are 
you full?” And it will say, “Are there any 
more?”
31. And Paradise will be brought closer to the 
pious, not far away.
32. “This is what you were promised—for 
every careful penitent.
33. Who inwardly feared the Most Gracious, 
and came with a repentant heart.
34. Enter it in peace. This is the Day of Eter￾nity.”
35. Therein they will have whatever they de￾sire—and We have even more.
36. How many generations before them, who 
were more powerful than they, did We de￾stroy? They explored the lands—was there 
any escape?
37. In that is a reminder for whoever possesses 
a heart, or cares to listen and witness.
38. We created the heavens and the earth and 
what is between them in six days, and no fa￾tigue touched Us.
39. So endure what they say, and proclaim the 
praises of your Lord before the rising of the 
sun, and before sunset.
40. And glorify Him during the night, and at 
the end of devotions.
41. And listen for the Day when the caller calls 
from a nearby place.
42. The Day when they will hear the Shout in 
all truth. That is the Day of Emergence.
43. It is We who control life and death, and to 
Us is the destination.
44. The Day when the earth will crack for them 
at once. That is an easy gathering for Us.
199
51. THE SPREADERS (adh-Dhariyat)
45. We are fully aware of what they say, and 
you are not a dictator over them. So remind 
by the Quran whoever fears My warning.
51. THE SPREADERS
(adh-Dhariyat)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. By the spreaders spreading.
2. And those carrying loads.
3. And those moving gently.
4. And those distributing as commanded.
5. What you are promised is true.
6. Judgment will take place.
7. By the sky that is woven.
8. You differ in what you say.
9. Averted from it is he who is averted.
10. Perish the imposters.
11. Those who are dazed in ignorance.
12. They ask, “When is the Day of Judgment?”
13. The Day they are presented to the Fire.
14. “Taste your ordeal. This is what you used 
to challenge.”
15. But the pious are amidst gardens and 
springs.
16. Receiving what their Lord has given them. 
They were virtuous before that.
17. They used to sleep a little at night.
18. And at dawn, they would pray for pardon.
19. And in their wealth, there was a share for 
the beggar and the deprived.
20. And on earth are signs for the convinced.
21. And within yourselves. Do you not see?
22. And in the heaven is your livelihood, and 
what you are promised.
23. By the Lord of the heaven and the earth, it 
is as true as the fact that you speak.
24. Has the story of Abraham’s honorable 
guests reached you?
25. When they entered upon him, they said, 
“Peace.” He said, “Peace, strangers.”
26. Then he slipped away to his family, and 
brought a fatted calf.
27. He set it before them. He said, “Will you 
not eat?”
28. And he harbored fear of them. They said, 
“Do not fear,” and they announced to him the 
good news of a knowledgeable boy.
29. His wife came forward crying. She clasped 
her face, and said, “A barren old woman?”
30. They said, “Thus spoke your Lord. He is 
the Wise, the Knowing.”
31. He said, “What is your business, O en￾voys?”
32. They said, “We are sent to a people guilty 
of sin.”
33. “To unleash upon them rocks of clay.”
34. “Marked by your Lord for the excessive.”
35. We evacuated all the believers who were in 
it.
36. But found in it only one household of Mus￾lims.
37. And We left in it a sign for those who fear 
the painful punishment.
38. And in Moses. We sent him to Pharaoh 
with a clear authority.
39. But he turned away with his warlords, and 
said, “A sorcerer or a madman.”
40. So We seized him and his troops, and 
threw them into the sea, and He was to 
blame.
41. And in Aad. We unleashed against them 
the devastating wind.
42. It spared nothing it came upon, but ren￾dered it like decayed ruins.
43. And in Thamood. They were told, “Enjoy 
yourselves for a while.”
200
52. THE MOUNT (at-Tur)
44. But they defied the command of their Lord, 
so the lightning struck them as they looked 
on.
45. They could not rise up, nor could they find 
help.
46. And before that, the people of Noah. They 
were immoral people.
47. We constructed the universe with power, 
and We are expanding it.
48. And the earth—We spread it out—How 
well We prepared it!
49. We created all things in pairs, so that you 
may reflect and ponder.
50. “So flee towards Allah. I am to you from 
Him a clear warner.”
51. “And do not set up any other god with Al￾lah. I am to you from Him a clear warner.”
52. Likewise, no messenger came to those be￾fore them, but they said, “A sorcerer or a 
madman.”
53. Did they recommend it to one another? In 
fact, they are rebellious people.
54. So turn away from them; you are not to 
blame.
55. And remind, for the reminder benefits the 
believers.
56. I did not create the jinn and the humans 
except to worship Me.
57. I need no livelihood from them, nor do I 
need them to feed Me.
58. Allah is the Provider, the One with Power, 
the Strong.
59. Those who do wrong will have their turn, 
like the turn of their counterparts, so let them 
not rush Me.
60. So woe to those who disbelieve because of 
that Day of theirs which they are promised.
52. THE MOUNT
(at-Tur)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. By the Mount.
2. And a Book inscribed.
3. In a published scroll.
4. And the frequented House.
5. And the elevated roof.
6. And the seething sea.
7. The punishment of your Lord is coming.
8. There is nothing to avert it.
9. On the Day when the heaven sways in agi￾tation.
10. And the mountains go into motion.
11. Woe on that Day to the deniers.
12. Those who play with speculation.
13. The Day when they are shoved into the Fire 
of Hell forcefully.
14. “This is the Fire which you used to deny.
15. Is this magic, or do you not see?
16. Burn in it. Whether you are patient, or im￾patient, it is the same for you. You are only 
being repaid for what you used to do.”
17. But the righteous will be amid gardens and 
bliss.
18. Enjoying what their Lord has given them, 
and their Lord has spared them the suffering 
of Hell.
19. Eat and drink happily, for what you used to 
do.
20. Relaxing on luxurious furnishings; and We 
will couple them with gorgeous spouses.
21. Those who believed, and their offspring 
followed them in faith—We will unite them 
with their offspring, and We will not deprive 
them of any of their works. Every person is 
hostage to what he has earned.
22. And We will supply them with fruit, and 
meat; such as they desire.
23. They will exchange therein a cup; wherein 
is neither harm, nor sin.
24. Serving them will be youths like hidden 
pearls.
201
53. THE STAR (an-Najm)
25. And they will approach one another, in￾quiring.
26. They will say, “Before this, we were fearful 
for our families.
27. But Allah blessed us, and spared us the ag￾ony of the Fiery Winds.
28. Before this, we used to pray to Him. He is 
the Good, the Compassionate.”
29. So remind. By the grace of your Lord, you 
are neither a soothsayer, nor a madman.
30. Or do they say, “A poet—we await for him 
a calamity of time”?
31. Say, “Go on waiting; I will be waiting with 
you.”
32. Or is it that their dreams compel them to 
this? Or are they aggressive people?
33. Or do they say, “He made it up”? Rather, 
they do not believe.
34. So let them produce a discourse like it, if 
they are truthful.
35. Or were they created out of nothing? Or 
are they the creators?
36. Or did they create the heavens and the 
earth? In fact, they are not certain.
37. Or do they possess the treasuries of your 
Lord? Or are they the controllers?
38. Or do they have a stairway by means of 
which they listen? Then let their listener pro￾duce a clear proof.
39. Or for Him the daughters, and for you the 
sons?
40. Or do you demand a payment from them, 
and they are burdened by debt?
41. Or do they know the future, and they are 
writing it down?
42. Or are they planning a conspiracy? The 
conspiracy will befall the disbelievers.
43. Or do they have a god besides Allah? Allah 
transcends what they associate.
44. Even if they were to see lumps of the sky 
falling down, they would say, “A mass of 
clouds.”
45. So leave them until they meet their Day in 
which they will be stunned.
46. The Day when their ploys will avail them 
nothing; and they will not be helped.
47. For those who do wrong, there is a punish￾ment besides that; but most of them do not 
know.
48. So patiently await the decision of your 
Lord, for you are before Our Eyes; and pro￾claim the praises of your Lord when you 
arise.
49. And glorify Him during the night, and at 
the receding of the stars.
53. THE STAR
(an-Najm)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. By the star as it goes down.
2. Your friend has not gone astray, nor has he 
erred.
3. Nor does he speak out of desire.
4. It is but a revelation revealed.
5. Taught to him by the Extremely Powerful.
6. The one of vigor. He settled.
7. While he was at the highest horizon.
8. Then he came near, and hovered around.
9. He was within two bows’ length, or closer.
10. Then He revealed to His servant what He 
revealed.
11. The heart did not lie about what it saw.
12. Will you dispute with him concerning 
what he saw?
13. He saw him on another descent.
14. At the Lotus Tree of the Extremity.
15. Near which is the Garden of Repose.
16. As there covered the Lotus Tree what cov￾ered it.
17. The sight did not waver, nor did it exceed.
202
53. THE STAR (an-Najm)
18. He saw some of the Great Signs of his Lord.
19. Have you considered al-Lat and al-Uzza?
20. And Manat, the third one, the other?
21. Are you to have the males, and He the fe￾males?
22. What a bizarre distribution.
23. These are nothing but names, which you 
have devised, you and your ancestors, for 
which Allah sent down no authority. They 
follow nothing but assumptions, and what 
the ego desires, even though guidance has 
come to them from their Lord.
24. Or is the human being to have whatever he 
desires?
25. To Allah belong the Last and the First.
26. How many an angel is there in the heavens 
whose intercession avails nothing, except af￾ter Allah gives permission to whomever He 
wills, and approves?
27. Those who do not believe in the Hereafter 
give the angels the names of females.
28. They have no knowledge of that. They only 
follow assumptions, and assumptions are no 
substitute for the truth.
29. So avoid him who has turned away from 
Our remembrance, and desires nothing but 
the present life.
30. That is the extent of their knowledge. Your 
Lord knows best who has strayed from His 
path, and He knows best who has accepted 
guidance.
31. To Allah belongs whatever is in the heav￾ens and whatever is on earth. He will repay 
those who do evil according to their deeds, 
and recompense those who do good with the 
best.
32. Those who avoid gross sins and indecen￾cies—except for minor lapses—your Lord is 
of Vast Forgiveness. He knows you well, ever 
since He created you from the earth, and ever 
since you were embryos in your mothers’ 
wombs. So do not acclaim your own virtue; 
He is fully aware of the righteous.
33. Have you considered him who turned 
away?
34. And gave a little, and held back?
35. Does he possess knowledge of the unseen, 
and can therefore foresee?
36. Or was he not informed of what is in the 
Scrolls of Moses?
37. And of Abraham, who fulfilled?
38. That no soul bears the burdens of another 
soul.
39. And that the human being attains only 
what he strives for.
40. And that his efforts will be witnessed.
41. Then he will be rewarded for it the fullest 
reward.
42. And that to your Lord is the finality.
43. And that it is He who causes laughter and 
weeping.
44.And that it is He who gives death and life.
45. And that it is He who created the two 
kinds—the male and the female.
46. From a sperm drop, when emitted.
47. And that upon Him is the next existence.
48. And that it is He who enriches and impov￾erishes.
49.And that it is He who is the Lord of Sirius.
50. And that it is He who destroyed the first 
Aad.
51. And Thamood, sparing no one.
52. And the people of Noah before that; for 
they were most unjust and most oppressive.
53. And He toppled the ruined cities.
54. And covered them with whatever covered 
them.
55. So which of your Lord's marvels can you 
deny?
56. This is a warning, just like the first warn￾ings.
57. The inevitable is imminent.
58. None besides Allah can unveil it.
203
54. THE MOON (al-Qamar)
59. Do you marvel at this discourse?
60. And laugh, and do not weep?
61. Lost in your frivolity?
62. So bow down to Allah, and worship!
54. THE MOON
(al-Qamar)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. The Hour has drawn near, and the moon 
has split.
2. Yet whenever they see a miracle, they turn 
away, and say, “Continuous magic.”
3. They lied, and followed their opinions, but 
everything has its time.
4. And there came to them news containing a 
deterrent.
5. Profound wisdom—but warnings are of no 
avail.
6. So turn away from them. On the Day when 
the Caller calls to something terrible.
7. Their eyes humiliated, they will emerge 
from the graves, as if they were swarming lo￾custs.
8. Scrambling towards the Caller, the disbe￾lievers will say, “This is a difficult Day.”
9. Before them the people of Noah disbelieved. 
They rejected Our servant, and said, “Crazy,” 
and he was rebuked.
10. So he appealed to his Lord, “I am over￾whelmed, so help me.”
11. So We opened the floodgates of heaven 
with water pouring down.
12. And We made the earth burst with springs, 
and the waters met for a purpose already des￾tined.
13. And We carried him on a craft of planks 
and nails.
14. Sailing before Our eyes; a reward for him 
who was rejected.
15. And We left it as a sign. Is there anyone 
who would take heed?
16. So how were My punishment and My 
warnings?
17. We made the Quran easy to learn. Is there 
anyone who would learn?
18. Aad denied the truth. So how were My 
punishment and My warnings?
19. We unleashed upon them a screaming 
wind, on a day of unrelenting misery.
20. Plucking the people away, as though they 
were trunks of uprooted palm-trees.
21. So how were My punishment and My 
warnings?
22. We made the Quran easy to remember. Is 
there anyone who would remember?
23. Thamood rejected the warnings.
24. They said, “Are we to follow one of us, a 
human being? We would then go astray, and 
end up in Hell.
25. Was the message given to him, out of all of 
us? In fact, he is a wicked liar.”
26. They will know tomorrow who the wicked 
liar is.
27. We are sending the she-camel as a test for 
them; so watch them and be patient.
28. And inform them that the water is to be 
shared between them; each share of drink 
made available.
29. But they called their friend, and he dared, 
and he slaughtered.
30. So how were My punishment and My 
warnings?
31. We sent against them a single Scream, and 
they became like crushed hay.
32. We made the Quran easy to understand. Is 
there anyone who would understand?
33. The people of Lot rejected the warnings.
34. We unleashed upon them a shower of
stones, except for the family of Lot; We res￾cued them at dawn.
204
55. THE COMPASSIONATE (ar-Rahman)
35. A blessing from Us. Thus We reward the 
thankful.
36. He had warned them of Our onslaught, but 
they dismissed the warnings.
37. They even lusted for his guest, so We oblit￾erated their eyes. “So taste My punishment 
and My warnings.”
38. Early morning brought upon them endur￾ing punishment.
39. So taste My punishment and My warnings.
40. We made the Quran easy to memorize. Is 
there anyone who would memorize?
41. The warnings also came to the people of 
Pharaoh.
42. They rejected Our signs, all of them, so We 
seized them—the seizure of an Almighty 
Omnipotent.
43. Are your unbelievers better than all those? 
Or do you have immunity in the scriptures?
44. Or do they say, “We are united, and we will 
be victorious”?
45. The multitude will be defeated, and they 
will turn their backs.
46. The Hour is their appointed time—the 
Hour is more disastrous, and most bitter.
47. The wicked are in confusion and madness.
48. The Day when they are dragged upon their 
faces into the Fire: “Taste the touch of Saqar.”
49. Everything We created is precisely meas￾ured.
50. And Our command is but once, like the 
twinkling of an eye.
51. We have destroyed your likes. Is there an￾yone who would ponder?
52. Everything they have done is in the Books.
53. Everything, small or large, is written down.
54. The righteous will be amidst gardens and 
rivers.
55. In an assembly of virtue, in the presence of 
an Omnipotent King.
55. THE COMPASSIONATE
(ar-Rahman)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. The Compassionate.
2. Has taught the Quran.
3. He created man.
4. And taught him clear expression.
5. The sun and the moon move according to 
plan.
6. And the stars and the trees prostrate them￾selves.
7. And the sky, He raised; and He set up the 
balance.
8. So do not transgress in the balance.
9. But maintain the weights with justice, and 
do not violate the balance.
10. And the earth; He set up for the creatures.
11. In it are fruits, and palms in clusters.
12. And grains in the blades, and fragrant 
plants.
13. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you 
deny?
14. He created man from hard clay, like bricks.
15. And created the jinn from a fusion of fire.

deny?

Wests.

deny?

not overrun.

deny?

deny?

landmarks.

deny?

27. But will remain the Presence of your Lord, 
Full of Majesty and Splendor.

deny?
29. Everyone in the heavens and the earth asks 
Him. Every day He is managing.
30. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you 
deny?
31. We will attend to you, O prominent two.
32. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you 
deny?
33. O society of jinn and humans! If you can 
pass through the bounds of the heavens and 
the earth, go ahead and pass. But you will not 
pass except with authorization.
34. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you 
deny?
35. You will be bombarded with flares of fire 
and brass, and you will not succeed.
36. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you 
deny?
37. When the sky splits apart, and becomes 
rose, like paint.
38. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you 
deny?

asked about his sins.

deny?

marks; they will be taken by the forelocks and 
the feet.

deny?
43. This is Hell that the guilty denied.
44. They circulate between it and between a

deny?

deny?

67. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you 
deny?
68. In them are fruits, and date-palms, and 
pomegranates.
69. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you 
deny?

deny?

jinn.

carpets.

Majesty and Splendor.
56. THE INEVITABLE
(al-Waqi’ah)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. When the inevitable occurs.
2. Of its occurrence, there is no denial.
3. Bringing low, raising high.
4. When the earth is shaken with a shock.
5. And the mountains are crushed and crum￾bled.
6. And they become scattered dust.
7. And you become three classes.
8. Those on the Right—what of those on the 
Right?
9. And those on the Left—what of those on the 
Left?
10. And the forerunners, the forerunners.
11. Those are the nearest.
12. In the Gardens of Bliss.
13. A throng from the ancients.
14. And a small band from the latecomers.
15. On luxurious furnishings.
16. Reclining on them, facing one another.
17. Serving them will be immortalized youth.
18. With cups, pitchers, and sparkling drinks.
19. Causing them neither headache, nor intox￾ication.
20. And fruits of their choice.
21. And meat of birds that they may desire.
22. And lovely companions.
23. The likenesses of treasured pearls.
24. As a reward for what they used to do.
25. Therein they will hear no nonsense, and no 
accusations.
26. But only the greeting: “Peace, peace.”
27. And those on the Right—what of those on 
the Right?
28. In lush orchards.
29. And sweet-smelling plants.
30. And extended shade.
31. And outpouring water.
32. And abundant fruit.
33. Neither withheld, nor forbidden.
34. And uplifted mattresses.
35. We have created them of special creation.
36. And made them virgins.
37. Tender and un-aging.
38. For those on the Right.
39. A throng from the ancients.
40. And a throng from the latecomers.
41. And those on the Left—what of those on 
the Left?
42. Amid searing wind and boiling water.
43. And a shadow of thick smoke.
207
56. THE INEVITABLE (al-Waqi’ah)
44. Neither cool, nor refreshing.
45. They had lived before that in luxury.
46. And they used to persist in immense 
wrongdoing.
47. And they used to say, “When we are dead 
and turned into dust and bones, are we to be 
resurrected?
48. And our ancient ancestors too?”
49. Say, “The first and the last.
50. Will be gathered for the appointment of a 
familiar Day.”
51. Then you, you misguided, who deny the 
truth.
52. Will be eating from the Tree of Bitterness.
53. Will be filling your bellies with it.
54. Will be drinking on top of it boiling water.
55. Drinking like thirsty camels drink. 
56. That is their hospitality on the Day of Ret￾ribution.
57. We created you—if only you would be￾lieve!
58. Have you seen what you ejaculate?
59. Is it you who create it, or are We the Crea￾tor?
60. We have decreed death among you, and 
We will not be outstripped.
61. In replacing you with your likes, and trans￾forming you into what you do not know.
62. You have known the first formation; if only 
you would remember.
63. Have you seen what you cultivate?
64. Is it you who make it grow, or are We the 
Grower?
65. If We will, We can turn it into rubble; then 
you will lament.
66. “We are penalized.
67. No, we are being deprived.”
68. Have you seen the water you drink?
69. Is it you who sent it down from the clouds, 
or are We the Sender?
70. If We will, We can make it salty. Will you 
not be thankful?
71. Have you seen the fire you kindle?
72. Is it you who produce its tree, or are We 
the Producer?
73. We have made it a reminder, and a comfort 
for the users.
74. So glorify the Name of your Great Lord.
75. I swear by the locations of the stars.
76. It is an oath, if you only knew, that is tre￾mendous.
77. It is a noble Quran.
78. In a well-protected Book.
79. None can grasp it except the purified.
80. A revelation from the Lord of the Worlds.
81. Is it this discourse that you take so lightly?
82. And you make it your livelihood to deny it?
83. So when it has reached the throat.
84. As you are looking on.
85. We are nearer to it than you are, but you 
do not see.
86. If you are not held to account.
87. Then bring it back, if you are truthful.
88. But if he is one of those brought near.
89. Then happiness, and flowers, and Garden 
of Delights.
90. And if he is one of those on the Right.
91. Then, “Peace upon you,” from those on the 
Right.
92. But if he is one of the deniers, the mistaken.
93. Then a welcome of Inferno.
94. And burning in Hell.
95. This is the certain truth.
96. So glorify the Name of your Lord, the Mag￾nificent
208
57. IRON (al-Hadid`)
57. IRON
(al-Hadid`)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Glorifying Allah is everything in the heav￾ens and the earth. He is the Almighty, the 
Wise.
2. To Him belongs the kingdom of the heav￾ens and the earth. He gives life and causes 
death, and He has power over all things.
3. He is the First and the Last, and the Outer 
and the Inner, and He has knowledge of all 
things.
4. It is He who created the heavens and the 
earth in six days, then settled over the 
Throne. He knows what penetrates into the 
earth, and what comes out of it, and what de￾scends from the sky, and what ascends to it. 
And He is with you wherever you may be. Al￾lah is Seeing of everything you do.
5. To Him belongs the kingship of the heavens 
and the earth, and to Allah all matters are re￾ferred.
6. He merges the night into the day, and He
merges the day into the night; and He knows 
what the hearts contains.
7. Believe in Allah and His Messenger, and 
spend from what He made you inherit. Those 
among you who believe and give will have a 
great reward.
8. What is the matter with you that you do not 
believe in Allah, when the Messenger calls 
you to believe in your Lord, and He has re￾ceived a pledge from you, if you are believers?
9. It is He who sends down upon His servant 
clear revelations, to bring you out of darkness 
into the light. Allah is Gentle towards you, 
Most Compassionate.
10. And why is it that you do not spend in the 
cause of Allah, when to Allah belongs the in￾heritance of the heavens and the earth? Not 
equal among you are those who contributed 
before the conquest, and fought. Those are 
higher in rank than those who contributed 
afterwards, and fought. But Allah promises 
both a good reward. Allah is Well Experi￾enced in what you do.
11. Who is he who will lend Allah a loan of 
goodness, that He may double it for him, and 
will have a generous reward?
12. On the Day when you see the believing 
men and believing women—their light radi￾ating ahead of them, and to their right: “Good 
news for you today: gardens beneath which 
rivers flow, dwelling therein forever. That is 
the great triumph.”
13. On the Day when the hypocritical men and 
hypocritical women will say to those who be￾lieved, “Wait for us; let us absorb some of 
your light.” It will be said, “Go back behind 
you, and seek light.” A wall will be raised be￾tween them, in which is a door; within it is 
mercy, and outside it is agony.
14. They will call to them, “Were we not with 
you?” They will say, “Yes, but you cheated 
your souls, and waited, and doubted, and be￾came deluded by wishful thinking, until the 
command of Allah arrived; and arrogance 
deceived you regarding Allah.”
15. “Therefore, today no ransom will be ac￾cepted from you, nor from those who disbe￾lieved. The Fire is your refuge. It is your com￾panion—what an evil fate!”
16. Is it not time for those who believe to sur￾render their hearts to the remembrance of Al￾lah, and to the truth that has come down, and 
not be like those who were given the Book 
previously, but time became prolonged for 
them, so their hearts hardened, and many of 
them are sinners?
17. Know that Allah revives the earth after its 
death. We thus explain the revelations for 
you, so that you may understand.
18. The charitable men and charitable women, 
who have loaned Allah a loan of righteous￾ness—it will be multiplied for them, and for 
them is a generous reward.
19. Those who believe in Allah and His mes￾sengers—these are the sincere and the wit-
209
58. THE ARGUMENT (al-Mujadilah)
nesses with their Lord; they will have their re￾ward and their light. But as for those who dis￾believe and deny Our revelations—these are 
the inmates of the Blaze.
20. Know that the worldly life is only play, and 
distraction, and glitter, and boasting among 
you, and rivalry in wealth and children. It is 
like a rainfall that produces plants, and de￾lights the disbelievers. But then it withers, 
and you see it yellowing, and then it becomes 
debris. While in the Hereafter there is severe 
agony, and forgiveness from Allah, and ac￾ceptance. The life of this world is nothing but 
enjoyment of vanity.
21. Race towards forgiveness from your Lord; 
and a Garden as vast as the heavens and the 
earth, prepared for those who believe in Allah 
and His messengers. That is the grace of Al￾lah; He bestows it on whomever He wills. Al￾lah is the Possessor of Immense Grace.
22. No calamity occurs on earth, or in your 
souls, but it is in a Book, even before We 
make it happen. That is easy for Allah.
23. That you may not sorrow over what eludes 
you, nor exult over what He has given you. 
Allah does not love the proud snob.
24. Those who are stingy, and induce people to 
be stingy. Whoever turns away—Allah is the 
Independent, the Praiseworthy.
25. We sent Our messengers with the clear 
proofs, and We sent down with them the 
Book and the Balance, that humanity may 
uphold justice. And We sent down iron, in 
which is violent force, and benefits for hu￾manity. That Allah may know who supports 
Him and His messengers invisibly. Allah is 
Strong and Powerful.
26. We sent Noah and Abraham, and estab￾lished in their line Prophethood and the 
Scripture. Some of them are guided, but 
many of them are sinners.
27. Then We sent in their wake Our messen￾gers, and followed up with Jesus son of Mary, 
and We gave him the Gospel, and instilled in 
the hearts of those who followed him com￾passion and mercy. But as for the monasti￾cism which they invented—We did not or￾dain it for them—only to seek Allah’s ap￾proval. But they did not observe it with its 
due observance. So We gave those of them 
who believed their reward, but many of them 
are sinful.
28. O you who believe! Fear Allah, and believe 
in His Messenger: He will give you a double 
portion of His mercy, and will give you a light 
by which you walk, and will forgive you. Al￾lah is Forgiving and Merciful.
29. That the People of the Book may know that 
they have no power whatsoever over Allah’s 
grace, and that all grace is in Allah’s hand; He 
gives it to whomever He wills. Allah is Pos￾sessor of Great Grace.
58. THE ARGUMENT
(al-Mujadilah)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Allah has heard the statement of she who 
argued with you concerning her husband, as 
she complained to Allah. Allah heard your 
conversation. Allah is Hearing and Seeing.
2. Those of you who estrange their wives by 
equating them with their mothers—they are 
not their mothers. Their mothers are none 
else but those who gave birth to them. What 
they say is evil, and a blatant lie. But Allah is 
Pardoning and Forgiving.
3. Those who estrange their wives by equating 
them with their mothers, then go back on 
what they said, must set free a slave before 
they may touch one another. To this you are 
exhorted, and Allah is well aware of what you 
do.
4. But whoever cannot find the means must 
fast for two consecutive months before they 
may touch one another. And if he is unable, 
then the feeding of sixty needy people. This, 
in order that you affirm your faith in Allah 
and His Messenger. These are the ordinances 
210
58. THE ARGUMENT (al-Mujadilah)
of Allah. The unbelievers will have a painful 
punishment.
5. Those who oppose Allah and His Messen￾ger will be subdued, as those before them 
were subdued. We have revealed clear mes￾sages. The unbelievers will have a demeaning 
punishment.
6. On the Day when Allah resurrects them all, 
and informs them of what they did. Allah has 
kept count of it, but they have forgotten it. 
Allah is Witness over everything.
7. Do you not realize that Allah knows every￾thing in the heavens and everything on earth? 
There is no secret counsel between three, but 
He is their fourth; nor between five, but He is 
their sixth; nor less than that, nor more, but 
He is with them wherever they may be. Then, 
on the Day of Resurrection, He will inform 
them of what they did. Allah has knowledge 
of everything.
8. Have you noted those who were prohibited 
from conspiring secretly, but then reverted to 
what they were prohibited from? They con￾spire to commit sin, and aggression, and de￾fiance of the Messenger. And when they 
come to you, they greet you with a greeting 
that Allah never greeted you with. And they 
say within themselves, “Why does Allah not 
punish us for what we say?” Hell is enough 
for them. They will roast in it. What a miser￾able destiny!
9. O you who believe! When you converse se￾cretly, do not converse in sin, and aggression, 
and disobedience of the Messenger; but con￾verse in virtue and piety; And fear Allah, to 
Whom you will be gathered.
10. Conspiracies are from Satan, that he may 
dishearten those who believe; but he will not 
harm them in the least, except by leave of Al￾lah. So let the believers put their trust in Al￾lah.
11. O you who believe! When you are told to 
make room in your gatherings, make room; 
Allah will make room for you. And when you 
are told to disperse, disperse. Allah elevates 
those among you who believe, and those 
given knowledge, many steps. Allah is Aware 
of what you do.
12. O you who believe! When you converse 
privately with the Messenger, offer some￾thing in charity before your conversation. 
That is better for you, and purer. But if you 
do not find the means—Allah is Forgiving 
and Merciful.
13. Are you reluctant to offer charity before 
your conversation? If you do not do so, and 
Allah pardons you, then perform the prayer, 
and give alms, and obey Allah and His Mes￾senger. Allah is Aware of what you do.
14. Have you considered those who befriended 
a people with whom Allah has become angry? 
They are not of you, nor of them. And they 
swear to a lie while they know.
15. Allah has prepared for them a terrible pun￾ishment. Evil is what they used to do.
16. They took their oaths as a screen, and pre￾vented others from Allah’s path. They will 
have a shameful punishment.
17. Neither their possessions nor their chil￾dren will avail them anything against Allah. 
These are the inhabitants of the Fire, dwelling 
therein forever.
18. On the Day when Allah will resurrect them 
altogether—they will swear to Him, as they 
swear to you, thinking that they are upon 
something. Indeed, they themselves are the 
liars.
19. Satan has taken hold of them, and so has 
caused them to forget the remembrance of 
Allah. These are the partisans of Satan. In￾deed, it is Satan’s partisans who are the losers.
20. Those who oppose Allah and His Messen￾ger are among the lowliest.
21. Allah has written: “I will certainly prevail, I 
and My messengers.” Allah is Strong and 
Mighty.
22. You will not find a people who believe in 
Allah and the Last Day, loving those who op￾pose Allah and His Messenger, even if they 
were their parents, or their children, or their 
siblings, or their close relatives. These—He 
211
59. THE MOBILIZATION (al-Hashr)
has inscribed faith in their hearts, and has 
supported them with a spirit from Him. And 
He will admit them into Gardens beneath 
which rivers flow, wherein they will dwell 
forever. Allah is pleased with them, and they 
are pleased with Him. These are the partisans 
of Allah. Indeed, it is Allah’s partisans who 
are the successful.
59. THE MOBILIZATION
(al-Hashr)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Glorifying Allah is all that exists in the heav￾ens and the earth. He is the Almighty, the 
Most Wise.
2. It is He who evicted those who disbelieved 
among the People of the Book from their 
homes at the first mobilization. You did not 
think they would leave, and they thought 
their fortresses would protect them from Al￾lah. But Allah came at them from where they 
never expected, and threw terror into their 
hearts. They wrecked their homes with their 
own hands, and by the hands of the believers. 
Therefore, take a lesson, O you who have in￾sight.
3. Had Allah not decreed exile for them, He 
would have punished them in this life. But in 
the Hereafter they will have the punishment 
of the Fire.
4. That is because they opposed Allah and His 
Messenger. Whoever opposes Allah—Allah 
is stern in retribution.
5. Whether you cut down a tree, or leave it 
standing on its trunk, it is by Allah’s will. He 
will surely disgrace the sinners.
6. Whatever Allah has bestowed upon His 
Messenger from them; you spurred neither 
horse nor camel for them, but Allah gives au￾thority to His messengers over whomever He 
will. Allah is Able to do all things.
7. Whatever Allah restored to His Messenger 
from the inhabitants of the villages belongs to 
Allah, and to the Messenger, and to the rela￾tives, and to the orphans, and to the poor, and 
to the wayfarer; so that it may not circulate 
solely between the wealthy among you. 
Whatever the Messenger gives you, accept it; 
and whatever he forbids you, abstain from it. 
And fear Allah. Allah is severe in punish￾ment.
8. To the poor refugees who were driven out 
of their homes and their possessions, as they 
sought the favor of Allah and His approval, 
and came to the aid of Allah and His Messen￾ger. These are the sincere.
9. And those who, before them, had settled in 
the homeland, and had accepted faith. They 
love those who emigrated to them, and find 
no hesitation in their hearts in helping them. 
They give them priority over themselves, 
even if they themselves are needy. Whoever 
is protected from his natural greed—it is they 
who are the successful.
10. And those who came after them, saying, 
“Our Lord, forgive us, and our brethren who 
preceded us in faith, and leave no malice in 
our hearts towards those who believe. Our 
Lord, You are Clement and Merciful.”
11. Have you not considered those who act 
hypocritically? They say to their brethren 
who disbelieved among the People of the 
Book, “If you are evicted, we will leave with 
you, and will not obey anyone against you; 
and should anyone fight you, we will cer￾tainly support you.” But Allah bears witness 
that they are liars.
12. If they are evicted, they will not leave with 
them; and if anyone fights them, they will not 
support them; and if they go to their aid, they 
will turn their backs and flee; then they will 
receive no support.
13. Fear of you is more intense in their hearts 
than fear of Allah. That is because they are a 
people who do not understand.
14. They will not fight you all together except 
from fortified strongholds, or from behind 
walls. Their hostility towards each other is se￾vere. You would think they are united, but 
212
60. THE WOMAN TESTED (al-Mumtahina)
their hearts are diverse. That is because they 
are a people who do not understand.
15. Like those shortly before them. They expe￾rienced the consequences of their decisions. 
For them is a painful punishment.
16. Like the devil, when he says to the human 
being, “Disbelieve.” But when he has disbe￾lieved, he says, “I am innocent of you; I fear 
Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.”
17. The ultimate end for both of them is the 
Fire, where they will dwell forever. Such is the 
requital for the wrongdoers.
18. O you who believe! Fear Allah, and let 
every soul consider what it has forwarded for 
the morrow, and fear Allah. Allah is Aware of 
what you do.
19. And do not be like those who forgot Allah, 
so He made them forget themselves. These 
are the sinners.
20. Not equal are the inhabitants of the Fire 
and the inhabitants of Paradise. It is the in￾habitants of Paradise who are the winners.
21. Had We sent this Quran down on a moun￾tain, you would have seen it trembling, crum￾bling in awe of Allah. These parables We cite 
for the people, so that they may reflect. 
22. He is Allah. There is no god but He, the 
Knower of secrets and declarations. He is the 
Compassionate, the Merciful.
23. He is Allah; besides Whom there is no god; 
the Sovereign, the Holy, the Peace-Giver, the 
Faith-Giver, the Overseer, the Almighty, the 
Omnipotent, the Overwhelming. Glory be to 
Allah, beyond what they associate.
24. He is Allah; the Creator, the Maker, the De￾signer. His are the Most Beautiful Names. 
Whatever is in the heavens and the earth glo￾rifies Him. He is the Majestic, the Wise.
60. THE WOMAN TESTED
(al-Mumtahina)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. O you who believe! Do not take My enemies 
and your enemies for supporters, offering 
them affection, when they have disbelieved in 
what has come to you of the Truth. They have 
expelled the Messenger, and you, because you 
believed in Allah, your Lord. If you have mo￾bilized to strive for My cause, seeking My ap￾proval, how can you secretly love them? I 
know what you conceal and what you reveal. 
Whoever among you does that has strayed 
from the right way.
2. Whenever they encounter you, they treat 
you as enemies, and they stretch their hands 
and tongues against you with malice. They 
wish that you would disbelieve.
3. Neither your relatives nor your children 
will benefit you on the Day of Resurrection. 
He will separate between you. Allah is Ob￾servant of what you do.
4. You have had an excellent example in Abra￾ham and those with him; when they said to 
their people, “We are quit of you, and what 
you worship apart from Allah. We denounce 
you. Enmity and hatred has surfaced between 
us and you, forever, until you believe in Allah 
alone.” Except for the words of Abraham to 
his father, “I will ask forgiveness for you, 
though I have no power from Allah to do an￾ything for you.” “Our Lord, in You we trust, 
and to You we repent, and to You is the ulti￾mate resort.
5. Our Lord, do not make us a target for those 
who disbelieve, and forgive us, our Lord. You 
are indeed the Mighty and Wise.”
6. There is an excellent example in them for 
you—for anyone who seeks Allah and the 
Last Day. But whoever turns away—Allah is 
the Self-Sufficient, the Most Praised.
7. Perhaps Allah will plant affection between 
you and those of them you consider enemies. 
Allah is Capable. Allah is Forgiving and Mer￾ciful.
8. As for those who have not fought against 
you for your religion, nor expelled you from 
your homes, Allah does not prohibit you 
from dealing with them kindly and equitably. 
Allah loves the equitable.
213
61. COLUMN (as-Saff)
9. But Allah prohibits you from befriending 
those who fought against you over your reli￾gion, and expelled you from your homes, and 
aided in your expulsion. Whoever takes them 
for friends—these are the wrongdoers.
10. O you who believe! When believing 
women come to you emigrating, test them. 
Allah is Aware of their faith. And if you find 
them to be faithful, do not send them back to 
the unbelievers. They are not lawful for them, 
nor are they lawful for them. But give them 
what they have spent. You are not at fault if 
you marry them, provided you give them 
their compensation. And do not hold on to 
ties with unbelieving women, but demand 
what you have spent, and let them demand 
what they have spent. This is the rule of Allah; 
He rules among you. Allah is Knowing and 
Wise.
11. If any of your wives desert you to the unbe￾lievers, and you decide to penalize them, give 
those whose wives have gone away the equiv￾alent of what they had spent. And fear Allah, 
in whom you are believers.
12. O prophet! If believing women come to 
you, pledging allegiance to you, on condition 
that they will not associate anything with Al￾lah, nor steal, nor commit adultery, nor kill 
their children, nor commit perjury as to 
parenthood, nor disobey you in anything 
righteous, accept their allegiance and ask Al￾lah’s forgiveness for them. Allah is Forgiving 
and Merciful.
13. O you who believe! Do not befriend people 
with whom Allah has become angry, and 
have despaired of the Hereafter, as the faith￾less have despaired of the occupants of the 
graves.
61. COLUMN
(as-Saff)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Everything in the heavens and the earth 
praises Allah. He is the Almighty, the Wise.
2. O you who believe! Why do you say what 
you do not do?
3. It is most hateful to Allah that you say what 
you do not do.
4. Allah loves those who fight in His cause, in 
ranks, as though they were a compact struc￾ture.
5. When Moses said to his people, “O my peo￾ple, why do you hurt me, although you know 
that I am Allah’s Messenger to you?” And 
when they swerved, Allah swerved their 
hearts. Allah does not guide the sinful people.
6. And when Jesus son of Mary said, “O Chil￾dren of Israel, I am Allah’s Messenger to you, 
confirming what preceded me of the Torah, 
and announcing good news of a messenger 
who will come after me, whose name is Ah￾mad.” But when he showed them the mira￾cles, they said, “This is obvious sorcery.”
7. And who is a greater wrongdoer than he 
who attributes falsehoods to Allah, when he 
is being invited to Islam? Allah does not 
guide the wrongdoing people.
8. They want to extinguish Allah’s Light with 
their mouths; but Allah will complete His 
Light, even though the disbelievers dislike it.
9. It is He who sent His Messenger with the 
guidance and the true religion, to make it 
prevail over all religions, even though the 
idolaters dislike it.
10. O you who believe! Shall I inform you of a 
trade that will save you from a painful tor￾ment?
11. That you believe in Allah and His Messen￾ger, and strive in the cause of Allah with your 
possessions and yourselves. That is best for 
you, if you only knew.
12. He will forgive you your sins; and will ad￾mit you into gardens beneath which rivers 
flow, and into beautiful mansions in the Gar￾dens of Eden. That is the supreme success.
13. And something else you love: support from 
Allah, and imminent victory. So give good 
news to the believers.
214
62. FRIDAY (al-Jumu’ah)
14. O you who believe! Be supporters of Allah, 
as Jesus son of Mary said to the disciples, 
“Who are my supporters towards Allah?” 
The disciples said, “We are Allah's support￾ers.” So a group of the Children of Israel be￾lieved, while another group disbelieved. We 
supported those who believed against their 
foe, so they became dominant.
62. FRIDAY
(al-Jumu’ah)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Everything in the heavens and the earth glo￾rifies Allah the Sovereign, the Holy, the Al￾mighty, the Wise.
2. It is He who sent among the unlettered a 
messenger from themselves; reciting His rev￾elations to them, and purifying them, and 
teaching them the Scripture and wisdom; alt￾hough they were in obvious error before that.
3. And others from them, who have not yet 
joined them. He is the Glorious, the Wise.
4. That is Allah’s grace, which He grants to 
whomever He wills. Allah is Possessor of lim￾itless grace.
5. The example of those who were entrusted 
with the Torah, but then failed to uphold it, 
is like the donkey carrying works of litera￾ture. Miserable is the example of the people 
who denounce Allah’s revelations. Allah does 
not guide the wrongdoing people.
6. Say, “O you who follow Judaism; if you 
claim to be the chosen of Allah, to the exclu￾sion of the rest of mankind, then wish for 
death if you are sincere.”
7. But they will not wish for it, ever, due to 
what their hands have advanced. Allah knows 
well the wrongdoers.
8. Say, “The death from which you flee will 
catch up with you; then you will be returned 
to the Knower of the Invisible and the Visible, 
and He will inform you of what you used to 
do.”
9. O you who believe! When the call is made 
for prayer on Congregation Day, hasten to 
the remembrance of Allah, and drop all busi￾ness. That is better for you, if you only knew.
10. Then, when the prayer is concluded, dis￾perse through the land, and seek Allah’s 
bounty, and remember Allah much, so that 
you may prosper.
11. Yet whenever they come across some busi￾ness, or some entertainment, they scramble 
towards it, and leave you standing. Say, 
“What is with Allah is better than entertain￾ment and business; and Allah is the Best of 
providers.”
63. THE HYPOCRITES
(al-Munafiqun)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. When the hypocrites come to you, they say, 
“We bear witness that you are Allah’s Mes￾senger.” Allah knows that you are His Mes￾senger, and Allah bears witness that the hyp￾ocrites are liars.
2. They treat their oaths as a cover, and so they 
repel others from Allah’s path. Evil is what 
they do.
3. That is because they believed, and then dis￾believed; so their hearts were sealed, and they 
cannot understand.
4. When you see them, their appearance im￾presses you. And when they speak, you listen 
to what they say. They are like propped-up 
timber. They think every shout is aimed at 
them. They are the enemy, so beware of them. 
Allah condemns them; how deluded they are!
5. And when it is said to them, “Come, the 
Messenger of Allah will ask forgiveness for 
you,” they bend their heads, and you see them 
turning away arrogantly.
6. It is the same for them, whether you ask for￾giveness for them, or do not ask forgiveness 
for them; Allah will not forgive them. Allah 
does not guide the sinful people.
215
64. GATHERING (at-Taghabun)
7. It is they who say: “Do not spend anything 
on those who side with Allah’s Messenger, 
unless they have dispersed.” To Allah belong 
the treasures of the heavens and the earth, but 
the hypocrites do not understand.
8. They say, “If we return to the City, the more 
powerful therein will evict the weak.” But 
power belongs to Allah, and His Messenger, 
and the believers; but the hypocrites do not 
know.
9. O you who believe! Let neither your posses￾sions nor your children distract you from the 
remembrance of Allah. Whoever does that—
these are the losers.
10. And give from what We have provided for 
you, before death approaches one of you, and 
he says, “My Lord, if only You would delay 
me for a short while, so that I may be charita￾ble, and be one of the righteous.”
11. But Allah will not delay a soul when its time 
has come. Allah is Informed of what you do.
64. GATHERING
(at-Taghabun)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Everything in the heavens and the earth 
praises Allah. To Him belongs the Kingdom, 
and to Him all praise is due, and He is Able 
to do all things.
2. It is He who created you. Some of you are 
unbelievers, and some of you are believers. 
And Allah perceives what you do.
3. He created the heavens and the earth with 
truth, and He designed you, and designed 
you well, and to Him is the final return.
4. He knows everything in the heavens and the 
earth, and He knows what you conceal and 
what you reveal. And Allah knows what is 
within the hearts.
5. Has the news not reached you, of those who 
disbelieved before? They tasted the ill conse￾quences of their conduct, and a painful tor￾ment awaits them.
6. That is because their messengers came to 
them with clear explanations, but they said, 
“Are human beings going to guide us?” So 
they disbelieved and turned away. But Allah 
is in no need. Allah is Independent and 
Praiseworthy.
7. Those who disbelieve claim that they will 
not be resurrected. Say, “Yes indeed, by my 
Lord, you will be resurrected; then you will be 
informed of everything you did; and that is 
easy for Allah.”
8. So believe in Allah and His Messenger, and 
the Light which We sent down. Allah is 
Aware of everything you do.
9. The Day when He gathers you for the Day 
of Gathering—that is the Day of Mutual Ex￾change. Whoever believes in Allah and acts 
with integrity, He will remit his misdeeds, 
and will admit him into gardens beneath 
which rivers flow, to dwell therein forever. 
That is the supreme achievement.
10. But as for those who disbelieve and de￾nounce Our revelations—these are the in￾mates of the Fire, dwelling therein forever; 
and what a miserable fate!
11. No disaster occurs except by Allah’s leave. 
Whoever believes in Allah, He guides his 
heart. Allah is Aware of everything.
12. So obey Allah, and obey the Messenger. But 
if you turn away—it is only incumbent on 
Our Messenger to deliver the clear message.
13. Allah, there is no god but He; and in Allah 
let the believers put their trust.
14. O you who believe! Among your wives and 
your children are enemies to you, so beware 
of them. But if you pardon, and overlook, and 
forgive—Allah is Forgiver and Merciful.
15. Your possessions and your children are a 
test, but with Allah is a splendid reward.
16. So be conscious of Allah as much as you 
can, and listen, and obey, and give for your 
own good. He who is protected from his stin￾giness—these are the prosperous.
216
65. DIVORCE (at-Talaq)
17. If you lend Allah a good loan, He will mul￾tiply it for you, and will forgive you. Allah is 
Appreciative and Forbearing.
18. The Knower of the Unseen and the Seen, 
the Almighty, the Wise.
65. DIVORCE
(at-Talaq)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. O Prophet! If any of you divorce women, di￾vorce them during their period of purity, and 
calculate their term. And be pious before Al￾lah, your Lord. And do not evict them from 
their homes, nor shall they leave, unless they 
have committed a proven adultery. These are 
the limits of Allah—whoever oversteps Al￾lah’s limits has wronged his own soul. You 
never know; Allah may afterwards bring 
about a new situation.
2. Once they have reached their term, either 
retain them honorably, or separate from 
them honorably. And call to witness two just 
people from among you, and give upright tes￾timony for Allah. By that is exhorted whoever 
believes in Allah and the Last Day. And who￾ever fears Allah—He will make a way out for 
him.
3. And will provide for him from where he 
never expected. Whoever relies on Allah—
He will suffice him. Allah will accomplish His 
purpose. Allah has set a measure to all things.
4. As for those of your women who have 
reached menopause, if you have any doubts, 
their term shall be three months—and also 
for those who have not menstruated. As for 
those who are pregnant, their term shall be 
until they have delivered. Whoever fears Al￾lah—He will make things easy for him.
5. This is the ordinance of Allah, which He 
sent down to you. Whoever fears Allah—He 
will remit his sins, and will amplify his re￾ward.
6. Allow them to reside where you reside, ac￾cording to your means, and do not harass 
them in order to make things difficult for 
them. If they are pregnant, spend on them 
until they give birth. And if they nurse your 
infant, give them their payment. And con￾duct your relation in amity. But if you disa￾gree, then let another woman nurse him.
7. The wealthy shall spend according to his 
means; and he whose resources are restricted 
shall spend according to what Allah has given 
him. Allah never burdens a soul beyond what 
He has given it. Allah will bring ease after 
hardship.
8. How many a town defied the command of 
its Lord and His messengers? So We held it 
strictly accountable, and We punished it with 
a dreadful punishment.
9. It tasted the result of its decisions, and the 
outcome of its decisions was perdition.
10. Allah has prepared for them a severe retri￾bution. So beware of Allah, O you who pos￾sess intellect and have faith. Allah has sent 
down to you a Reminder.
11. A messenger who recites to you Allah’s 
Verses, clear and distinct, that he may bring 
those who believe and work righteousness 
from darkness into light. Whoever believes in 
Allah and acts with integrity, He will admit 
him into gardens beneath which rivers flow, 
therein to abide forever. Allah has given him 
an excellent provision.
12. Allah is He Who created seven heavens, 
and their like of earth. The command de￾scends through them, so that you may know 
that Allah is Capable of everything, and that 
Allah Encompasses everything in knowledge.
66. PROHIBITION
(at-Tahrim)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. O prophet! Why do you prohibit what Allah 
has permitted for you, seeking to please your 
wives? Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
217
67. SOVEREIGNTY (al-Mulk)
2. Allah has decreed for you the dissolution of 
your oaths. Allah is your Master. He is the 
All-Knowing, the Most Wise.
3. The Prophet told something in confidence 
to one of his wives. But when she disclosed it, 
and Allah made it known to him; he commu￾nicated part of it, and he avoided another 
part. Then, when he informed her of it, she 
said, “Who informed you of this?” He said, 
“The All-Knowing, the All-Informed, in￾formed me.”
4. If you repent to Allah, then your hearts have 
listened. But if you band together against 
him, then Allah is his Ally, as is Gabriel, and 
the righteous believers. In addition, the an￾gels will assist him.
5. Perhaps, if he divorces you, his Lord will 
give him in exchange wives better than you: 
submissive, believing, obedient, penitent, de￾vout, fasting—previously married, or virgins.
6. O you who believe! Protect yourselves and 
your families from a Fire, whose fuel is people 
and stones. Over it are angels, fierce and pow￾erful. They never disobey Allah in anything 
He commands them, and they carry out 
whatever they are commanded.
7. O you who disbelieved! Make no excuses 
today. You are being repaid for what you 
used to do.
8. O you who believe! Repent to Allah with 
sincere repentance. Perhaps your Lord will 
remit your sins, and admit you into gardens 
beneath which rivers flow, on the Day when 
Allah will not disappoint the Prophet and 
those who believed with him. Their light 
streaming before them, and to their right, 
they will say, “Our Lord, complete our light 
for us, and forgive us; You are capable of all 
things.”
9. O prophet! Strive hard against the disbe￾lievers and the hypocrites, and be stern with 
them. Their abode is Hell. What a miserable 
destination!
10. Allah illustrates an example of those who 
disbelieve: the wife of Noah and the wife of 
Lot. They were under two of Our righteous 
servants, but they betrayed them. They 
availed them nothing against Allah, and it 
was said, “Enter the Fire with those who are 
entering.”
11. And Allah illustrates an example of those 
who believe: the wife of Pharaoh, when she 
said, “My Lord, build for me, with you, a 
house in Paradise, and save me from Pharaoh 
and his works, and save me from the wrong￾doing people.”
12. And Mary, the daughter of Imran, who 
guarded her womb, and so We breathed into 
her of Our Spirit; and she believed in the 
truth of her Lord’s Words and His Books, and 
was one of the devout.
67. SOVEREIGNTY
(al-Mulk)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Blessed is He in whose hand is the sover￾eignty, and Who has power over everything.
2. He who created death and life—to test 
you—as to which of you is better in conduct. 
He is the Almighty, the Forgiving.
3. He who created seven heavens in layers. 
You see no discrepancy in the creation of the 
Compassionate. Look again. Can you see any 
cracks?
4. Then look again, and again, and your sight 
will return to you dazzled and exhausted.
5. We have adorned the lower heaven with 
lanterns, and made them missiles against the 
devils; and We have prepared for them the 
punishment of the Blaze.
6. For those who reject their Lord, there is the 
torment of Hell. What an evil destination!
7. When they are thrown into it, they will hear 
it roaring, as it seethes.
8. It almost bursts with fury. Every time a 
batch is thrown into it, its keepers will ask 
them, “Has no warner come to you?”
218
68. THE PEN (al-Qalam)
9. They will say, “Yes, a warner did come to us, 
but we disbelieved, and said, ‘Allah did not 
send down anything; you are very much mis￾taken.’”
10. And they will say, “Had we listened or rea￾soned, we would not have been among the in￾mates of the Blaze.”
11. So they will acknowledge their sins. So 
away with the inmates of the Blaze.
12. As for those who fear their Lord in secret—
for them is forgiveness and a great reward.
13. Whether you keep your words secret, or 
declare them—He is Aware of the inner
thoughts.
14. Would He not know, He Who created? He 
is the Refined, the Expert.
15. It is He who made the earth manageable for 
you, so travel its regions, and eat of His pro￾visions. To Him is the Resurgence.
16. Are you confident that the One in heaven 
will not cause the earth to collapse beneath 
you as it spins?
17. Or are you confident that the One in 
Heaven will not unleash against you a violent 
storm? Then you will know what My warning 
is like.
18. Those before them also denied the truth; 
and how was My disapproval?
19. Have they not seen the birds above them, 
spreading their wings, and folding them? 
None holds them except the Compassionate. 
He is Perceiver of everything.
20. Or who is this who is a force for you to pro￾tect you against the Compassionate? The dis￾believers are in nothing but delusion.
21. Or who is this that will provide for you, if 
He withholds His provision? Yet they persist 
in defiance and aversion.
22. Is he who walks bent on his own design 
better guided, or he who walks upright on a 
straight path?
23. Say, “It is He who produced you; and made 
for you the hearing, and the vision, and the 
organs. But rarely do you give thanks.”
24. Say, “It is He who scattered you on earth, 
and to Him you will be rounded up.”
25. And they say, “When will this promise be 
fulfilled, if you are truthful?”
26. Say, “Knowledge is with Allah, and I am 
only a clear warner.”
27. But when they see it approaching, the faces 
of those who disbelieved will turn gloomy, 
and it will be said, “This is what you used to 
call for.”
28. Say, “Have you considered? Should Allah 
make me perish, and those with me; or else 
He bestows His mercy on us; who will protect 
the disbelievers from an agonizing torment?”
29. Say, “He is the Compassionate. We have 
faith in Him, and in Him we trust. Soon you 
will know who is in evident error.”
30. Say, “Have you considered? If your water 
drains away, who will bring you pure running 
water?”
68. THE PEN
(al-Qalam)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Noon. By the pen, and by what they in￾scribe.
2. By the grace of your Lord, you are not in￾sane.
3. In fact, you will have a reward that will 
never end.
4. And you are of a great moral character.
5. You will see, and they will see.
6. Which of you is the afflicted.
7. Your Lord knows best who has strayed from 
His path, and He knows best the well-guided.
8. So do not obey the deniers.
9. They would like you to compromise, so they 
would compromise.
10. And do not obey any vile swearer.
11. Backbiter, spreader of slander.
219
68. THE PEN (al-Qalam)
12. Preventer of good, transgressor, sinner.
13. Rude and fake besides.
14. Just because he has money and children.
15. When Our Verses are recited to him, he 
says, “Myths of the ancients!”
16. We will brand him on the muzzle.
17. We tested them, as We tested the owners of 
the garden, when they vowed to harvest it in 
the morning.
18. Without any reservation.
19. But a calamity from your Lord went 
around it while they slept.
20. And in the morning it was as if picked.
21. In the morning, they called to one another.
22. “Go early to your plantation, if you are go￾ing to harvest.”
23. So off they went, murmuring to one an￾other.
24. “No poor person is to enter it upon you to￾day.”
25. And early they went, resolved in intent.
26. But when they saw it, they said, “We were 
wrong.
27. We are now deprived.”
28. The most reasonable of them said, “Did I 
not say to you, ‘if only you would glorify?’”
29. They said, “Glory to our Lord—We were 
indeed in the wrong.”
30. Then they turned to one another, blaming 
one another.
31. They said, “Woe to us—we were indeed 
domineering.
32. Perhaps our Lord will give us a better sub￾stitute for it. We are turning to our Lord.”
33. Such is the punishment; but the punish￾ment of the Hereafter is greater, if they only 
knew.
34. For the righteous are Gardens of Delight 
with their Lord.
35. Shall We treat the Muslims like the vil￾lains?
36. What is the matter with you? How do you 
judge?
37. Or do you have a scripture in which you 
study.
38. Wherein there is whatever you choose?
39. Or do you have oaths from Us, binding un￾til the Day of Resurrection, that you will have 
whatever you demand?
40. Ask them, which of them will guarantee 
that.
41. Or do they have partners? Then let them 
produce their partners, if they are truthful.
42. On the Day when the Shin will be exposed, 
and they will be called to bow down, but they 
will be unable.
43. Their eyes subdued, shame will cover 
them. They were invited to bow down when 
they were sound.
44. So leave Me to those who reject this dis￾course; We will proceed against them gradu￾ally, from where they do not know.
45. And I will give them respite. My plan is 
firm.
46. Or do you ask them for a fee, so they are 
burdened with debt?
47. Or do they know the future, and so they 
write it down?
48. So wait patiently for the Decision of your 
Lord, and do not be like the Fellow of the Fish 
who cried out in despair.
49. Were it not for his Lord’s favor that 
reached him, he would have been thrown 
into the wilderness, fully despised.
50. But his Lord chose him, and made him one 
of the righteous.
51. Those who disbelieve almost stab you with 
their glances when they hear the message, 
and say, “He is crazy!”
52. But it is no less than a reminder to all the 
Worlds.
220
69. THE REALITY (al-Haqqah)
69. THE REALITY
(al-Haqqah)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. The Reality.
2. What is the Reality?
3. What will make you understand what the 
Reality is?
4. Thamood and Aad denied the Catastrophe.
5. As for Thamood, they were annihilated by 
the Overwhelming.
6. And as for Aad; they were annihilated by a 
furious, roaring wind.
7. He unleashed it upon them for seven nights 
and eight days, in succession. You could see 
the people tossed around, as though they 
were stumps of hollow palm-trees.
8. Can you see any remnant of them?
9. Then Pharaoh came, and those before him, 
and the Overturned Cities steeped in sin.
10. But they disobeyed the messenger of their 
Lord, so He seized them with an overpower￾ing grip.
11. When the waters overflowed, We carried 
you in the cruising ship.
12. To make it a lesson for you—so that retain￾ing ears may retain it. 
13. Then, when the Trumpet is sounded a sin￾gle time. 
14. And the earth and the mountains are lifted 
up, and crushed, with a single crush.
15. On that Day, the Event will come to pass.
16. And the heaven will crack; so on that Day 
it will be frail.
17. And the angels will be ranged around its 
borders, while eight will be carrying the 
Throne of your Lord above them that Day.
18. On that Day you will be exposed, and no 
secret of yours will remain hidden.
19. As for him who is given his book in his 
right hand, he will say, “Here, take my book 
and read it.
20. I knew I would be held accountable.”
21. So he will be in pleasant living.
22. In a lofty Garden.
23. Its pickings are within reach.
24. “Eat and drink merrily for what you did in 
the days gone by.”
25. But as for him who is given his book in his 
left hand, he will say, “I wish I was never 
given my book.
26. And never knew what my account was.
27. If only it was the end.
28. My money cannot avail me.
29. My power has vanished from me.”
30. “Take him and shackle him.
31. Then scorch him in the Blaze.
32. Then in a chain which length is seventy cu￾bits tie him up.
33. For he would not believe in Allah the 
Great.
34. Nor would he advocate the feeding of the 
destitute.
35. So he has no friend here today.
36. And no food except scum.
37. Which only the sinners eat.”
38. Indeed, I swear by what you see.
39. And by what you do not see.
40. It is the speech of a noble messenger.
41. And it is not the speech of a poet—little do 
you believe.
42. Nor is it the speech of a soothsayer—little 
do you take heed.
43. It is a revelation from the Lord of the 
Worlds.
44. Had he falsely attributed some statements 
to Us.
45. We would have seized him by the right 
arm.
221
70. WAYS OF ASCENT (al-Ma’arij)
46. Then slashed his lifeline.
47. And none of you could have restrained Us 
from him.
48. Surely, it is a message for the righteous.
49. And We know that some of you will reject 
it.
50. And it is surely a source of grief for the un￾believers.
51. Yet it is the absolute truth.
52. So glorify the name of your Lord, the Mag￾nificent.
70. WAYS OF ASCENT
(al-Ma’arij)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. A questioner questioned the imminent tor￾ment.
2. For the disbelievers; none can repel it.
3. From Allah, Lord of the Ways of Ascent.
4. Unto Him the angels and the Spirit ascend 
on a Day the duration of which is fifty thou￾sand years.
5. So be patient, with sweet patience.
6. They see it distant.
7. But We see it near.
8. On the Day when the sky will be like molten 
brass.
9. And the mountains will be like tufted wool.
10. No friend will care about his friend.
11. They will be shown each other. The crimi￾nal wishes he would be redeemed from the 
punishment of that Day by his children.
12. And his spouse, and his brother.
13. And his family that sheltered him.
14. And everyone on earth, in order to save 
him.
15. By no means! It is a Raging Fire.
16. It strips away the scalps.
17. It invites him who once turned his back 
and fled.
18. And accumulated and hoarded.
19. Man was created restless.
20. Touched by adversity, he is fretful.
21. Touched by good, he is ungenerous.
22. Except the prayerful.
23. Those who are constant at their prayers.
24. And those in whose wealth is a rightful 
share.
25. For the beggar and the deprived.
26. And those who affirm the Day of Judg￾ment.
27. And those who fear the punishment of 
their Lord.
28. Their Lord’s punishment is not to be taken 
for granted.
29. And those who guard their chastity.
30. Except from their spouses or those living 
under their control, for then they are free of 
blame.
31. But whoever seeks to go beyond that—
these are the transgressors.
32. And those who honor their trusts and their 
pledges.
33. And those who stand by their testimonies.
34. And those who are dedicated to their pray￾ers.
35. These will be honored in Gardens.
36. What is with those who disbelieve, stretch￾ing their necks towards you.
37. From the right, and from the left, banding 
together?
38. Is every one of them aspiring to be admit￾ted into a Garden of Bliss?
39. No indeed! We created them from what 
they know.
40. I swear by the Lord of the Easts and the 
Wests, that We are Able.
222
71. NOAH (Nuh)
41. To replace them with better than they, and 
We are not to be outdone.
42. So leave them to blunder and play, until 
they meet their Day which they are promised.
43. The Day when they will emerge from the 
tombs in a rush, as though they were hurry￾ing towards a target.
44. Their eyes cast down; overwhelmed by hu￾miliation. This is the Day which they were 
promised.
71. NOAH
(Nuh)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. We sent Noah to his people: “Warn your 
people before there comes upon them a pain￾ful punishment.”
2. He said, “O my people, I am to you a clear 
warner.
3. Worship Allah and reverence Him, and 
obey me.
4. And He will forgive you of your sins, and 
reprieve you until a stated term. Allah’s term 
cannot be deferred once it has arrived, if you 
only knew.”
5. He said, “My Lord, I have called my people 
night and day.
6. But my call added only to their flight.
7. Whenever I called them to Your for￾giveness, they thrust their fingers into their 
ears, and wrapped themselves in their gar￾ments, and insisted, and became more and 
more arrogant.
8. Then I called them openly.
9. Then I appealed to them publicly, and I 
spoke to them privately. 
10. I said, ‘Ask your Lord for forgiveness; He is 
Forgiving.
11. He will let loose the sky upon you in tor￾rents.
12. And provide you with wealth and children, 
and allot for you gardens, and allot for you 
rivers.
13. What is the matter with you, that you do 
not appreciate Allah’s Greatness?
14. Although He created you in stages.
15. Do you not realize that Allah created seven 
heavens in layers?
16. And He set the moon in their midst for 
light, and He made the sun a lamp.
17. And Allah germinated you from the earth
like plants.
18. Then He will return you into it, and will 
bring you out again.
19. And Allah made the earth a spread for you.
20. That you may travel its diverse roads.’”
21. Noah said, “My Lord, they have defied me, 
and followed him whose wealth and children 
increase him only in perdition.”
22. And they schemed outrageous schemes.
23. And they said, “Do not give up your gods; 
do not give up Wadd, nor Souwa, nor 
Yaghoos, and Yaooq, and Nassr.
24. They have misled many, so do not increase 
the wrongdoers except in confusion.”
25. Because of their wrongs, they were 
drowned, and were hurled into a Fire. They 
did not find apart from Allah any helpers.
26. Noah said, “My Lord, do not leave of the 
unbelievers a single dweller on earth.
27. If You leave them, they will mislead your 
servants, and will breed only wicked unbe￾lievers.
28. My Lord! Forgive me and my parents, and 
anyone who enters my home in faith, and all 
the believing men and believing women; and 
do not increase the wrongdoers except in 
perdition.”
72. THE JINN
(al-Jinn)
In the name of Allah, 
223
73. THE ENWRAPPED (al-Muzzammil)
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Say, “It was revealed to me that a band of 
jinn listened in, and said, ‘We have heard a 
wondrous Quran.
2. It guides to rectitude, so we have believed in 
it; and we will never associate anyone with 
our Lord.
3. And Exalted is the Grandeur of our Lord—
He never had a mate, nor a child.
4. But the fools among us used to say nonsense 
about Allah.
5. And we thought that humans and jinn 
would never utter lies about Allah.
6. Some individual humans used to seek 
power through some individual jinn, but they 
only increased them in confusion.
7. They thought, as you thought, that Allah 
would never resurrect anyone.
8. We probed the heaven, and found it filled 
with stern guards and projectiles.
9. We used to take up positions to listen in; but 
whoever listens now finds a projectile in wait 
for him.
10. We do not know whether ill is intended for 
those on earth, or if their Lord intends good￾ness for them.
11. Some of us are righteous, but some of us are 
less than that; we follow divergent paths.
12. We realized that we cannot defeat Allah on 
earth, and that we cannot escape Him by flee￾ing.
13. And when we heard the guidance, we be￾lieved in it. Whoever believes in his Lord 
fears neither loss, nor burden.
14. Among us are those who are submitting, 
and among us are the compromisers. As for 
those who have submitted—it is they who 
pursue rectitude.
15. But as for the compromisers—they will be 
firewood for Hell.’”
16. Had they kept true to the Path, We would 
have given them plenty water to drink.
17. To test them with it. Whoever turns away 
from the remembrance of his Lord, He will 
direct him to torment ever mounting.
18. The places of worship are for Allah. So do 
not call, besides Allah, upon anyone else.
19. And when the servant of Allah got up call￾ing on Him, they almost fell on him in a mass.
20. Say, “I pray only to my Lord, and I never 
associate anyone with Him.”
21. Say, “It is not in my power to harm you, nor 
to bring you to right conduct.”
22. Say, “No one can protect me from Allah, 
and I will not find any refuge except with 
Him.
23. Except for a proclamation from Allah and 
His messages. He who defies Allah and His 
Messenger—for him is the Fire of Hell, in 
which they will dwell forever.”
24. Until, when they see what they were prom￾ised, they will know who is weaker in helpers, 
and fewer in numbers.
25. Say, “I do not know whether what you are 
promised is near, or whether my Lord will ex￾tend it for a period.”
26. The Knower of the Invisible; He does not 
disclose His Invisible to anyone.
27. Except to a Messenger of His choosing. He 
then dispatches guards before him and be￾hind him.
28. That He may know that they have con￾veyed the messages of their Lord. He encom￾passes what they have, and has tallied every￾thing by number.
73. THE ENWRAPPED
(al-Muzzammil)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. O you Enwrapped one.
2. Stay up during the night, except a little.
3. For half of it, or reduce it a little.
224
74. THE ENROBED (al-Muddathir)
4. Or add to it; and chant the Quran rhythmi￾cally.
5. We are about to give you a heavy message.
6. The vigil of night is more effective, and bet￾ter suited for recitation.
7. In the daytime, you have lengthy work to 
do.
8. So remember the Name of your Lord, and 
devote yourself to Him wholeheartedly.
9. Lord of the East and the West. There is no 
god but He, so take Him as a Trustee.
10. And endure patiently what they say, and 
withdraw from them politely.
11. And leave Me to those who deny the truth, 
those of luxury, and give them a brief respite.
12. With Us are shackles, and a Fierce Fire.
13. And food that chokes, and a painful pun￾ishment.
14. On the Day when the earth and the moun￾tains tremble, and the mountains become 
heaps of sand.
15. We have sent to you a messenger, a witness 
over you, as We sent to Pharaoh a messenger.
16. But Pharaoh defied the Messenger, so We 
seized him with a terrible seizing.
17. So how will you, if you persist in unbelief, 
save yourself from a Day which will turn the 
children gray-haired?
18. The heaven will shatter thereby. His prom￾ise is always fulfilled.
19. This is a reminder. So whoever wills, let 
him take a path to his Lord.
20. Your Lord knows that you stay up nearly 
two-thirds of the night, or half of it, or one￾third of it, along with a group of those with 
you. Allah designed the night and the day. He 
knows that you are unable to sustain it, so He 
has pardoned you. So read of the Quran what 
is possible for you. He knows that some of 
you may be ill; and others travelling through 
the land, seeking Allah’s bounty; and others 
fighting in Allah’s cause. So read of it what is 
possible for you, and observe the prayers, and 
give regular charity, and lend Allah a gener￾ous loan. Whatever good you advance for 
yourselves, you will find it with Allah, better 
and generously rewarded. And seek Allah’s 
forgiveness, for Allah is Forgiving and Mer￾ciful.
74. THE ENROBED
(al-Muddathir)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. O you Enrobed one.
2. Arise and warn.
3. And magnify your Lord.
4. And purify your clothes.
5.And abandon abominations.
6. And show no favor seeking gain.
7. And be constant for your Lord.
8. When the Trumpet is blown.
9. That Day will be a difficult day.
10. For the disbelievers—not easy.
11. Leave Me to him whom I created alone.
12. And gave him vast wealth.
13. And children as witnesses.
14. And smoothed things for him.
15. Then he wants Me to add yet more!
16. By no means! He was stubborn towards 
Our revelations.
17. I will exhaust him increasingly.
18. He thought and analyzed.
19. May he perish, how he analyzed.
20. Again: may he perish, how he analyzed.
21. Then he looked.
22. Then he frowned and whined.
23. Then he turned back and was proud.
24. And said, “This is nothing but magic from 
the past.
25. This is nothing but the word of a mortal.”
225
75. RESURRECTION (al-Qiyamah)
26. I will roast him in Saqar.
27. But what will explain to you what Saqar is?
28. It neither leaves, nor spares.
29. It scorches the flesh.
30. Over it are Nineteen.
31. We have appointed only angels to be war￾dens of the Fire, and caused their number to 
be a stumbling block for those who disbe￾lieve; so that those given the Scripture may 
attain certainty; and those who believe may 
increase in faith; and those given the Scrip￾ture and the believers may not doubt; and 
those in whose hearts is sickness and the un￾believers may say, “What did Allah intend by 
this parable?” Thus Allah leads astray whom 
He wills, and guides whom He wills. None 
knows the soldiers of your Lord except He. 
This is nothing but a reminder for the mor￾tals.
32. Nay! By the moon.
33. And the night as it retreats.
34. And the morning as it lights up.
35. It is one of the greatest.
36. A warning to the mortals.
37. To whomever among you wishes to ad￾vance, or regress.
38. Every soul is hostage to what it has earned.
39. Except for those on the Right.
40. In Gardens, inquiring.
41. About the guilty.
42. “What drove you into Saqar?”
43. They will say, “We were not of those who 
prayed.
44. Nor did we feed the destitute.
45. And we used to indulge with those who in￾dulge.
46. And we used to deny the Day of Judgment.
47. Until the Inevitable came upon us.”
48. But the intercession of intercessors will not 
help them. 
49. Why are they turning away from the Re￾minder?
50. As though they were panicked donkeys.
51. Fleeing from a lion?
52. Yet every one of them desires to be given 
scrolls unrolled.
53. No indeed! But they do not fear the Here￾after.
54. Nevertheless, it is a reminder.
55. So whoever wills, shall remember it.
56. But they will not remember, unless Allah 
wills. He is the Source of Righteousness, and 
the Source of Forgiveness.
75. RESURRECTION
(al-Qiyamah)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. I swear by the Day of Resurrection.
2. And I swear by the blaming soul.
3. Does man think that We will not reassem￾ble his bones?
4. Yes indeed; We are Able to reconstruct his 
fingertips.
5. But man wants to deny what is ahead of 
him.
6. He asks, “When is the Day of Resurrec￾tion?”
7. When vision is dazzled.
8. And the moon is eclipsed.
9. And the sun and the moon are joined to￾gether.
10. On that Day, man will say, “Where is the 
escape?”
11. No indeed! There is no refuge.
12. To your Lord on that Day is the settlement.
13. On that Day man will be informed of eve￾rything he put forward, and everything he left 
behind.
14. And man will be evidence against himself.
226
76. MAN (al-Insan)
15. Even as he presents his excuses.
16. Do not wag your tongue with it, to hurry 
on with it.
17. Upon Us is its collection and its recitation.
18. Then, when We have recited it, follow its 
recitation.
19. Then upon Us is its explanation.
20. Alas, you love the fleeting life.
21. And you disregard the Hereafter.
22. Faces on that Day will be radiant.
23. Looking towards their Lord.
24. And faces on that Day will be gloomy.
25. Realizing that a back-breaker has befallen 
them.
26. Indeed, when it has reached the breast￾bones.
27. And it is said, “Who is the healer?”
28. And He realizes that it is the parting.
29. And leg is entwined with leg.
30. To your Lord on that Day is the drive.
31. He neither believed nor prayed.
32. But he denied and turned away.
33. Then he went to his family, full of pride.
34. Woe to you; and woe.
35. Then again: Woe to you; and woe.
36. Does man think that he will be left without 
purpose?
37. Was he not a drop of ejaculated semen?
38. Then he became a clot. And He created and 
proportioned?
39. And made of him the two sexes, the male 
and the female?
40. Is He not Able to revive the dead?
76. MAN
(al-Insan)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Has there come upon man a period of time 
when he was nothing to be mentioned?
2. We created man from a liquid mixture, to 
test him; and We made him hearing and see￾ing.
3. We guided him to the way, be he apprecia￾tive or unappreciative.
4. We have prepared for the faithless chains, 
and yokes, and a Searing Fire.
5. But the righteous will drink from a cup 
whose mixture is aroma.
6. A spring from which the servants of Allah 
will drink, making it gush abundantly.
7. They fulfill their vows, and dread a Day 
whose ill is widespread.
8. And they feed, for the love of Him, the poor, 
and the orphan, and the captive.
9. “We only feed you for the sake of Allah. We 
want from you neither compensation, nor 
gratitude.
10. We dread from our Lord a frowning grim 
Day.”
11. So Allah will protect them from the ills of 
that Day, and will grant them radiance and 
joy.
12. And will reward them for their patience 
with a Garden and silk.
13. Reclining therein on the thrones; experi￾encing therein neither sun, nor frost.
14. Its shade hovering over them, and its fruit 
brought low within reach.
15. Passing around them are vessels of silver, 
and cups of crystal.
16. Crystal of silver—they measured them ex￾actly.
17. They will be served therein with a cup 
whose flavor is Zanjabeel.
18. A spring therein named Salsabeel. 
19. Passing among them are eternalized 
youths. If you see them, you would think 
them sprinkled pearls.
227
77. THE UNLEASHED (al-Mursalat)
20. Wherever you look, you see bliss, and a 
vast kingdom.
21. Upon them are garments of green silk, and 
satin. And they will be adorned with bracelets 
of silver. And their Lord will offer them a 
pure drink.
22. “This is a reward for you. Your efforts are 
well appreciated.”
23. It is We who sent down the Quran upon 
you—a gradual revelation.
24. So be patient for the decision of your Lord, 
and do not obey the sinner or the blasphemer 
among them.
25. And mention the Name of your Lord, 
morning and evening.
26. And for part of the night, prostrate yourself 
to Him, and glorify Him long into the night.
27. As for these: they love the fleeting life, and 
leave behind a Heavy Day.
28. We created them, and strengthened their 
frame; and whenever We will, We can replace 
them with others like them.
29. This is a reminder; so whoever wills, let 
him take a path to his Lord.
30. Yet you cannot will, unless Allah wills. Al￾lah is Knowing and Wise.
31. He admits into His mercy whomever He 
wills. But as for the wrongdoers, He has pre￾pared for them a painful punishment.
77. THE UNLEASHED
(al-Mursalat)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. By those unleashed in succession.
2. Storming turbulently.
3. Scattering far and wide.
4. Separating decisively.
5. Delivering a message.
6. Excusing or warning.

11. And the messengers are alerted.
12. Until which day is it deferred?

14. And what will teach you what the Day of 
Decision is?
15. Woe on that Day to the liars. 
16. Did We not destroy the ancients?
17. Then succeeded them with the others?
18. This is how We deal with the guilty.
19. Woe on that Day to the rejecters.
20. Did We not create you from an insignifi￾cant fluid?
21. Then lodged it in a secure place?
22. For a known term?
23. We measured precisely. We are the best to 
measure.
24. Woe on that Day to the falsifiers.
25. Did We not make the earth a homestead?

46. “Eat and enjoy yourselves a little; you are 
indeed criminals.”
47. Woe on that Day to the liars.
48. And when it is said to them, “Kneel”, they 
do not kneel.
49. Woe on that Day to the rejecters.
50. In what message, beyond this, will they be￾lieve?
78. THE EVENT
(an-Naba’)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. What are they asking one another about?
2. About the Great Event.
3. About which they disagree.
4. Surely, they will find out.
5. Most certainly, they will find out.
6. Did We not make the earth a cradle?
7. And the mountains pegs?
8. And created you in pairs?
9. And made your sleep for rest?
10. And made the night a cover?
11. And made the day for livelihood?
12. And built above you seven strong ones?
13. And placed a blazing lamp?

15. To produce with it grains and vegetation?
16. And luxuriant gardens?
17. The Day of Sorting has been appointed.
18. The Day when the Trumpet is blown, and 
you will come in droves.
19. And the sky is opened up, and becomes 
gateways.

nor drink.
25. Except boiling water, and freezing hail.
26. A fitting requital.
27. For they were not anticipating any reckon￾ing.
28. And they denied Our signs utterly.
29. But We have enumerated everything in 
writing.
30. So taste! We will increase you only in suf￾fering.
31. But for the righteous there is triumph.
32. Gardens and vineyards.
33. And splendid spouses, well matched.
34. And delicious drinks.
35. They will hear therein neither gossip, nor 
lies.
36. A reward from your Lord, a fitting gift.
37. Lord of the heavens and the earth, and eve￾rything between them—The Most Merci￾ful—none can argue with Him.
38. On the Day when the Spirit and the angels 
stand in row. They will not speak, unless it be 
one permitted by the Most Merciful, and he 
will say what is right.
39. That is the Day of Reality. So whoever wills, 
let him take a way back to his Lord.
40. We have warned you of a near punish￾ment—the Day when a person will observe 
229
79. THE SNATCHERS (an-Nazi’at)
what his hands have produced, and the faith￾less will say, “O, I wish I were dust.”

10. They say, “Are we to be restored to the 
original condition?
11. When we have become hollow bones?”
12. They say, “This is a losing proposition.”
13. But it will be only a single nudge.
14. And they will be awake.
15. Has the story of Moses reached you? 
16. When His Lord called out to him in the sa￾cred valley of Tuwa.
17. “Go to Pharaoh—he has transgressed.”
18. And say, “Do you care to be cleansed?
19. And I will guide you to your Lord, and you 
will turn reverent.”
20. He showed him the Greatest Miracle.
21. But he denied and defied.
22. Then turned his back, and tried.
23. And gathered and proclaimed.
24. He said, “I am your Lord, the most high.”
25. So Allah seized him with an exemplary 
punishment, in the last and in the first.
26. In this is a lesson for whoever fears.
27. Are you more difficult to create, or the 
heaven? He constructed it.
28. He raised its masses, and proportioned it.
29. And He dimmed its night, and brought out 
its daylight.
30. And the earth after that He spread.
31. And from it, He produced its water and its 
pasture.
32. And the mountains, He anchored.
33. A source of enjoyment for you and for your 
animals.
34. But when the Great Cataclysm arrives.
35. A Day when man will remember what he 
has endeavored.
36. And Hell will be displayed to whoever sees.
37. As for him who was defiant.
38. And preferred the life of this world.
39. Then Hell is the shelter.
40. But as for him who feared the Standing of 
his Lord, and restrained the self from desires.
41. Then Paradise is the shelter.
42. They ask you about the Hour, “When will 
it take place?”
43. You have no knowledge of it.
44. To your Lord is its finality.
45. You are just a warner for whoever dreads 
it.
46. On the Day when they witness it—as 
though they only stayed an evening, or its 
morning.
80. HE FROWNED
(‘Abasa)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. He frowned and turned away.
2. When the blind man approached him.
3. But how do you know? Perhaps he was 
seeking to purify himself.
230
81. THE ROLLING (at-Takwir)
4. Or be reminded, and the message would 
benefit him.
5. But as for him who was indifferent.
6. You gave him your attention.
7. Though you are not liable if he does not pu￾rify himself.
8. But as for him who came to you seeking.
9. In awe.
10. To him you were inattentive.
11. Do not. This is a Lesson.
12. Whoever wills, shall remember it.
13. On honorable pages.
14. Exalted and purified.
15. By the hands of scribes.
16. Noble and devoted.
17. Perish man! How thankless he is!
18. From what did He create him?
19. From a sperm drop He created him, and 
enabled him.
20. Then He eased the way for him.
21. Then He puts him to death, and buries 
him.
22. Then, when He wills, He will resurrect 
him.
23. But no, he did not fulfill what He has com￾manded him.
24. Let man consider his food.
25. We pour down water in abundance.
26. Then crack the soil open. 
27. And grow in it grains.
28. And grapes and herbs.
29. And olives and dates.
30. And luscious gardens.
31. And fruits and vegetables.
32. Enjoyment for you, and for your livestock.
33. But when the Deafening Noise comes to 
pass.
34. The Day when a person will flee from his 
brother.
35. And his mother and his father.
36. And his consort and his children.
37. Every one of them, on that Day, will have 
enough to preoccupy him.
38. Faces on that Day will be radiant.
39. Laughing and rejoicing.
40. And Faces on that Day will be covered with 
misery.
41. Overwhelmed by remorse.

18. And by the morn as it breathes.
19. This is the speech of a noble messenger.
231
82. THE SHATTERING (al-Infitar)
20. Endowed with power, eminent with the 
Lord of the Throne. 
21. Obeyed and honest.
22. Your friend is not possessed.
23. He saw him on the luminous horizon.
24. And He does not withhold knowledge of 
the Unseen.
25. And it is not the word of an accursed devil.
26. So where are you heading?
27. It is only a Reminder to all mankind.
28. To whoever of you wills to go straight.
29. But you cannot will, unless Allah wills—
The Lord of the Worlds.

2. When the planets are scattered.
3. When the oceans are exploded.
4. When the tombs are strewn around.
5. Each soul will know what it has advanced, 
and what it has deferred.
6. O man! What deluded you concerning your 
Lord, the Most Generous?
7. He Who created you, and formed you, and 
proportioned you?
8. In whatever shape He willed, He assembled 
you.
9. But you reject the religion.
10. Though over you are watchers.
11. Honest recorders.
12. They know everything you do.
13. The virtuous will be in bliss.
14. While the wicked will be in Hell.
15. They will enter it on the Day of Justice.
16. And they will not be absent from it.
17. But what will convey to you what the Day 
of Justice is?
18. Then again, what will convey to you what 
the Day of Justice is?
19. The Day when no soul will avail another 
soul anything; and the decision on that Day 
is Allah’s.

(al-Mutaffifin)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Woe to the defrauders.
2. Those who, when they take a measure from 
people, they take in full.
3. But when they measure or weigh to others, 
they cheat.
4. Do these not know that they will be resur￾rected?
5. For a Great Day?
6. The Day when mankind will stand before 
the Lord of the Worlds?
7. Not at all. The record of the wicked is in Sijj￾een.
8. But how can you know what Sijjeen is?
9. A numerical book.
10. Woe on that Day to the deniers.
11. Those who deny the Day of Reckoning. 
12. But none denies it except the sinful aggres￾sor.
13. When Our revelations are recited to him, 
he says, “Legends of the ancients.”
14. Not at all. Their hearts have become cor￾roded by what they used to earn.
15. Not at all. On that Day, they will be 
screened from their Lord.
16. Then they will roast in Hell.
17. Then it will be said, “This is what you used 
to deny.”
232
84. THE RUPTURE (al-Inshiqaq)
18. No indeed; the record of the righteous is in 
Elliyyeen.
19. But how can you know what Elliyyoon is?

23. On thrones, looking on.
24. You will recognize on their faces the radi￾ance of bliss.
25. They will be given to drink a sealed wine.
26. Whose seal is musk—this is what compet￾itors should compete for.
27. Its mixture is of Tasneem.
28. A spring from which those brought near 
drink.
29. Those who committed crimes used to 
laugh at those who believed.
30. And when they passed by them, they would 
wink at one another.
31. And when they went back to their families, 
they would go back exulting.
32. And if they saw them, they would say, 
“These people are lost.”
33. Yet they were not sent as guardians over 
them.
34. But on that Day, those who believed will 
laugh at the unbelievers.
35. On luxurious furnishings, looking on.

they used to do?

not believe?

do not bow down?

25. Except those who believe and do good 
deeds; they will have an undiminished re￾ward.

women, then do not repent; for them is the 
punishment of Hell; for them is the punish￾ment of Burning.
11. Those who believe and do righteous deeds 
will have Gardens beneath which rivers flow. 
That is the great triumph.
12. The onslaught of your Lord is severe.
13. It is He who begins and repeats.
14. And He is the Forgiving, the Loving.
15. Possessor of the Glorious Throne.
16. Doer of whatever He wills.
17. Has there come to you the story of the le￾gions?

are created?
18. And at the sky—how it is raised?

20. And at the earth—how it is spread out?

6. Have you not seen how your Lord dealt 
with Aad?
7. Erum of the pillars.
8. The like of which was never created in the 
land.
9. And Thamood—those who carved the 
rocks in the valley.
10. And Pharaoh of the Stakes.
11. Those who committed excesses in the 
lands.
12. And spread much corruption therein.
13. So your Lord poured down upon them a 
scourge of punishment.
14. Your Lord is on the lookout.
15. As for man, whenever his Lord tests him, 
and honors him, and prospers him, he says, 
“My Lord has honored me.”
16. But whenever He tests him, and restricts 
his livelihood for him, he says, “My Lord has 
insulted me.”
17. Not at all. But you do not honor the or￾phan.
18. And you do not urge the feeding of the 
poor.
235
90. THE LAND (al-Balad)
19. And you devour inheritance with all greed.
20. And you love wealth with immense love.
21. No—when the earth is leveled, pounded, 
and crushed.
22. And your Lord comes, with the angels, row 
after row.
23. And on that Day, Hell is brought forward. 
On that Day, man will remember, but how 
will remembrance avail him?
24. He will say, “If only I had forwarded for my 
life.”
25. On that Day, none will punish as He pun￾ishes.
26. And none will shackle as He shackles.

8. Did We not give him two eyes?
9. And a tongue, and two lips?
10. And We showed him the two ways?
11. But he did not brave the ascent.
12. And what will explain to you what the as￾cent is?
13. The freeing of a slave.
14. Or the feeding on a day of hunger.
15. An orphan near of kin.
16. Or a destitute in the dust.
17. Then he becomes of those who believe, and 
advise one another to patience, and advise 
one another to kindness.
18. These are the people of happiness.
19. But as for those who defy Our revela￾tions—these are the people of misery.

10. Failing is he who corrupts it.
11. Thamood denied in its pride.
12. When it followed its most wicked.
13. The messenger of Allah said to them, “This 
is the she-camel of Allah, so let her drink.”
14. But they called him a liar, and hamstrung 
her. So their Lord crushed them for their sin, 
and leveled it.
15. And He does not fear its sequel.
