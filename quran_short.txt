“When you read the Quran, seek refuge with Allah from 
Satan the outcast. He has no authority over those who 
believe and trust in their Lord. His authority is only over 
those who follow him, and those who associate others 
with Him.” 
Verses 16:98-100

1. THE OPENING (al-Fatihah)
1. THE OPENING
(al-Fatihah)
1. In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Mer￾ciful.
2. Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds.
3. The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
4. Master of the Day of Judgment.
5. It is You we worship, and upon You we call 
for help.
6. Guide us to the straight path.
7. The path of those You have blessed, not of 
those against whom there is anger, nor of 
those who are misguided.
2. THE HEIFER
(al-Baqarah)
In the name of Allah, 
the Gracious, the Merciful 
1. Alif, Lam, Meem.
2. This is the Book in which there is no doubt, 
a guide for the righteous.
3. Those who believe in the unseen, and per￾form the prayers, and give from what We 
have provided for them.
4. And those who believe in what was revealed 
to you, and in what was revealed before you, 
and are certain of the Hereafter.
5. These are upon guidance from their Lord. 
These are the successful.
6. As for those who disbelieve—it is the same 
for them, whether you have warned them, or 
have not warned them—they do not believe.
7. Allah has set a seal on their hearts and on 
their hearing, and over their vision is a veil. 
They will have a severe torment.
8. Among the people are those who say, “We 
believe in Allah and in the Last Day,” but they 
are not believers.
9. They seek to deceive Allah and those who 
believe, but they deceive none but them￾selves, though they are not aware.
10. In their hearts is sickness, and Allah has in￾creased their sickness. They will have a pain￾ful punishment because of their denial.
11. And when it is said to them, “Do not make 
trouble on earth,” they say, “We are only re￾formers.”
12. In fact, they are the troublemakers, but they 
are not aware.
13. And when it is said to them, “Believe as the 
people have believed,” they say, “Shall we be￾lieve as the fools have believed?” In fact, it is 
they who are the fools, but they do not know.
14. And when they come across those who be￾lieve, they say, “We believe”; but when they 
are alone with their devils, they say, “We are 
with you; we were only ridiculing.”
15. It is Allah who ridicules them, and leaves 
them bewildered in their transgression.
16. Those are they who have bartered error for 
guidance; but their trade does not profit 
them, and they are not guided.
